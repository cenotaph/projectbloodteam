<p class="p1">I like Tower Recordings but never found them to be the be-all, end-all; it's funny how they were like this mothership for later projects like P.G. Six, MV &amp; EE, etc. but the actual records are really uneven. My view is coloured by my later perception of having seen MV in his stardom rise (at least rising to the king of a useless underground) and feeling like his hazy psych-wannabe style was rather disingenuous. But listening today, on a rainy and miserable day for me, this atmosphere really hits the spot. The songwriting has never been amazing in Tower Recordings, with P.G. Six the only conventionally talented songwriter and Valentine's compositions actually pretty terrible -- but this is more about the weird folky jams, built on abstractions and mood. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $0</p>
<p class="p1">This is a less-than-thrilling Simon Wickham-Smith record, that once you get past the perverse title, offers little in the way of extreme or bukake. Simon's interest in devotional music is really clear from the get-go, as the first track is built around Hindu chanting over which a distorted drone slowly resolves itself. The second track is a tribute to the monk who self-immolated himself to protest the Vietnam war. It begins with a distorted sequenced beat and brings in more chanting in layers, which is quite moving. The last two tracks are one 38 minute piece, the first part of which continues the minimalist drone of the first two tracks, and the last incorporating more active, rustling recordings, also processed with distortion. This is an unusually dirty and aggressive record for SW-S, despite the vocal drones, because of how much harsh static saturates it. I guess that's what the title comes from. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This CDr compilation puts together three of the leading artists from the UK's 'ecstatic drone' scene, which at the time of purchase I looked to with wide eyes, though in a few years I had met all these people and even played with some of them. Sunroof! is the opening and closing cut here, with two classic tracks, recorded in that typically raw style with clattering high pitched shaking, etc over the ringing sounds; some punchy guitar on 'Pink Horse Sweat', though it's a bit buried. Richard Youngs's track is the most minimal, being a quiet and pastoral series of ringing tones, from his more contemplative side. The live Vibracathedral track was recorded in Glasgow and by the end of it's 23 minutes it turns into full-on sturm und drang, with pounding floortoms and distorted electric guitars ringing out (Julian Bradley, I'd guess). The tribal monotony is epic, and poorly recorded of course, making the final Sunroof! track a beautiful comedown, 21 minutes of magical shimmer. [30 July 2012]</p>

I pulled this out for something random to have on while coding and it did the job.  [2 November 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">Jerry was happy that I bought this. [2002] I've always been mildly interested in Mike Nesmith's solo country-rock records but now that I've had my country-rock renaissance of 2012, this really hits me. This is credited to Nesmith + the First National Band and it really has a great "band" feel. They play with poise, and the sound (on pre-Dynaflex RCA vinyl, thank God) is crisp, built around stunning slide guitar work by Red Rhodes. Opening cut 'Calico Girlfriend' suggests we're going to be in the same West Coast wardrobe as the Burrito Bros, but it's actually a bit more genre-rooted. Nesmith's songwriting is enamored by the classics, as his liner notes state, and he's not afraid to yodel (on 'Mama Nantucket') or open up a more sensitive side ('Joanne'). There's still some residue of the Monkees goofyness on the little interlude that closes side 1 and invites the listener to flip the record, but for the most part this is truly heartfelt. The cover of 'Beyond the Blue Horizon' that closes things is stunning, a master cap to what's a really solid record. One time I was in a bar in Boston and I saw a chubby bald dude in his 40s wearing a t-shirt with this record on it. I started talking to him, just because it seemed so random, and he got incredibly excited to talk about Mike Nesmith with me and asked me if I belonged to the fan club and I was in over my head. It's a lovely shade of blue, though, and I would totally wear this as a t-shirt. [29 December 2012]</p>

Never cared for their later stuff which always felt a bit overdone; this is one of those personal indie rock classics. Nothing special, sure, but some great songs. 'New Slang' used to be my jam though it's now associated forever with a McDonald's commercial; the more upbeat songs are the easy associations but the more subtle songs like 'Your Algebra' and 'Caring is Creepy' are the most impressive now. I remember the second album had a bunch of songs that sounded like carbon copies of the hits from this one - there was a second-rate 'New Slang', a second-rate 'Know Your Onion!', etc. This is a pretty short LP overall but it leaves me fulfilled.

<p class="p1">An early Joseph Jarman record on Delmark is music to my ears. The first half, 'As If It Were the Seasons'/'Song to Make the Sun Come Up' has the same open, playful approach to wide-eyed abstraction that is found in that Marion Brown LP I love so much. There's a lot of plinking and planking, bells, odd strings, and Sherri Scott's voice floating over everything. There's a warmth here, a summer day being celebrated, and Jarman's players have a great deal of freedom but they're locked in with a common mindset. And then it explodes on 'Song for Christopher', a tribute to the deceased pianist from Jarman's band. It's no doubt a sad tune, but it's constantly pushing ahead, restlessly, perhaps projecting grief through curiosity. It works itself into a frenzy before finally crashing to nothing and letting Scott's wail build a new construction over gongs, errant harp plucks and scraping songs. It cyclically links to the first half of the record, a nice touch by Jarman and a nice ending too. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Another entry in the (once seemingly endless) <i>Carnival Folklore Resurrection </i>series, this is a double CD that, as the title indicates, deliberately apes Asian styles -- not unfamiliar territory for the Girls. There's a lot of fucking around on disc 1, <i>High Asia</i> - silly voices, inept stabs at non-Western instruments, and general madness. There's a strange indie-rock genre excursion in 'Old Glory's Fade' that sounds almost like an instrumental Silkworm track, and some spazzy insanity. Nothing is mindblowing but even the halfassed SCG has some charm, if you're a fan (I am). Disc two is a treat, though -- 40 minutes of Asian field recordings, mixed together from various sources, and primarily non-musical. You could call this sloppy ethnographic work, or a beautiful piece of music on its own, as it's punctuated throughout with shortwave radio recordings from Burma, making this an often-discordant pastiche. I forgot how great this was. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Tuxedomoon's first full-length is probably their strongest album, as it's positioned between their dark, edgy postpunk cool and the more synthetic 80s new wave direction to come. This was reissued by some hipster DJ label and it's easy to see why, as this sound definitely had descendants attaining popularity in the 00s. While some tracks sound remarkably dated ('59 to 1'), others eerie and exploratory ('Loneliness'). 'What Use?' is probably the hit here but the smaller tracks really resonate well. The violins and slight folk/ethnic tendencies are one of the more underrated aspects of Tuxedomoon and they're really evident here. [28 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Birdsongs of the Mesozoic are a band that I got into because I was way into Mission of Burma when I was 18, but also fancied myself a brainy, cerebral fan of classical-aspiring music. So when I found out that Swope and Miller did this on the side, my eyes lit up. I played piano and I liked smart instrumental indie rock stuff like Rachel's, and thus Birdsongs were like bread from heaven. There's a lot to like about them - the compositions are smart and dramatic, with some improvised guitar textures (see 'Drift', which has some freakout guitar by Swope) and a feeling that anyone could do this - it's not rocket science but it's aspirational and fits in nicely alongside other early 80s smartguy stuff like Rhys Chatham, Branca, etc. Roger Miller's piano playing has the same sweeping quality as the guy from Rip Rig and Panic/The Pop Group, but with a more mellow edge - maybe like the Pop Group crossed with the soundtrack to <i>The Conversation</i>.

<p class="p1">I know it was over a decade ago when I bought this, but I really didn't need it - I already owned a reissue on 180g vinyl, I think issued by Base, and I only grabbed this because it was ESP original that only cost $3.50. <i>One Nation Underground</i> actually sounds pretty good on a beat-to-shit ESP original. I think Rapp was seen as a bit of a Dylan ripoff back in '67, and when you listen to 'Playmate' it's pretty hilarious, how overtly he's going for that vocal style. There's a lot more desperation here than Dylan ever did though, and Rapp is an accomplished songwriter on his own, so this deserves it's classic status. Lyrics on the back are only for three songs but one of them is 'Drop Out!', exclamation point incredibly important because it's an imperative, get it? I used to joke that "the 60s are the future to me", but in reality, I'm still aesthetically stuck somewhere between 1967 and 1981. I'm a man out of place here in Estonia, and my enjoyment of records like this makes me feel even more so. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Source: Myopic Books, Providence</p>
<p class="p1">Cost: $5</p>
<p class="p1">I consider this among the original slate of Wire releases though it wasn't released until 1983 because it was recorded in '79/80 and finds the band at their most experimental. 'Crazy About Love' is a long moody piece with dual vocals by Newman and Gilbert, constructing almost a narrative that I can't quite follow and with strange repeated chants like "Where one is unable to take us ...". It feels almost like a studio construction in the dub style, perhaps with the drums being a loop or series of loops. It's long, and worth of it's own release as it wouldn't quite belong on <i>154. </i>Saxophones, synthesisers, and various unidentifiable sounds pop up frequently and it's pretty impressive. The flip has two tracks, 'Second Length (Our Swimmer)' which is a sci-fi futurist version of 'Our Swimmer', which picks up the mood a great bit from 'Crazy About Love'; and 'Catapult 30' which is amazing proto-industrial scraping. I have to declare this to be "essential" (whatever that means) cause it furthers the brilliant path they blazed in such a short time; it's easy to forget how even more insane it gets with the post-<i>154 </i>releases, such as <i>Document and Eyewitness</i>. The cover of this was re-used for the <i>Turns and Strokes</i> record which is confusing since I file them side-by-side; side two is included on <i>T&amp;S</i> but 'Crazy About Love' for some reason is not, making this necessary to own as well.

My interest in Ashley is based primarily on this and 'In Sara, Mencken...' and the aesthetic approach here is so insanely bizarre that I don't know what to make of it. From the cover art, suggesting a cool evening palm tree vibe to the way you hear a neighbour's stereo through the 'wall' of this recording, it's unlike anything I've ever heard. I love it.

<p class="p1">The first Moondog release is a statement of purpose in 14 short tracks, detailing his unique musical vision. The Moondog rhythm is present throughout, and most tracks begin and end with it unaccompanied, making this an episodic work. The instrumention is generally light - very street-musiciany, with occasional vocals (the 45 perfect seconds of 'Trees Against the Sky' being a highlight). I love when the strings come in, making 'Surf Session' a favourite (which is also the longest track, and the one that most resembles Mr. Hardin's later release on Columbia under the same title as this). The closing track, 'Street Scene', is recorded there and mixes in street ambience, which is pretty great stuff for 1956. [4 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've always liked gospel music, despite being a strict non-believer myself. There's something I love about people singing with conviction, about anything really, even if it's bullshit. This pre-war gospel collection ticks all the right buttons - it's the definitive document of what Greil Marcus called the "old, weird America" after the Harry Smith collection, and admittedly, the tone of this is so fire and brimstone/apocalyptic that it actually gives the Smith set a run for its money. The 26 tracks here are all from ancient recordings, all between 1926 and 1936 but most being in the late '20s. Some of this is bouncy and fun, with group singing, like Blind Roosevelt Graves and his brother's 'I'll Be Rested', though another track by him, 'Woke Up This Morning With my Mind on Jesus' is fucking sinister. There's songs against drinking moonshine, death, and prayer, like it should be; it's all accentuated by recording artefacts as to be expected with this material: hiss, static, and dropouts. Some sound better than others, but I'm listening to this to feel ghosts of some lost Americana, so when the guitars and banjos sound less than triumphant, it contributes to that aesthetic I so completely fetishise. This is amazing and I should get volume 2. [1 Aug 2012]</p>

Yeah, it's a giant ball of noise for large segments, but despite the staggering density there are some really fantastic parts. The first track in particular, which has three (!) drummers, gets into some real amazing back and forth shimmies. And there's some great tuba playing. This is a total 'who's who' of European improv greats from this time, and Schlippenbach leads it all (and is credited as "composer", though that is ridiculous). The recording is as good as possible with this many musicians all going apeshit, and I wish I had as many European free records from this time as I do American ones. [28 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I forgot about this one amongst the plethora of Richard Youngs releases, but this is a beautiful, stark record of nothing but voice and acoustic guitar. His fingerpicking style is tense, lending the songs a severity lacking in much acoustic singer-songwriter music. Of course, being Richard Youngs, there's a pastoral, inventive style to these, even if it's minimalist in form. I haven't heard these songs in so long - years and years - that they seemed totally new to me. And even though there's no surprises, there's a quality and presence that makes this one of his better solo albums, for sure. [22 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This very early R!!!S!!! release is built around an epic title track and some songs, all drenched in thick drones, reverberating against themseles until the echo becomes almost infinite. The songs are great, but so wet in mix terms that the songs lose clarity, and the lyrics become buried, and what might become a classic is a bit hard to interface with. The opening cut, 'I Live in a Big City' is pretty much a classic anyway, and the others are warped and processed into something fairly industrial. 'Just Imagine' has an infectious rhythm and 'At Home' is schizophrenic despite its monotony. The majority of side 2 is dedicated to the title track, a mishmash of high and low experimentalism. But first we get the double vocal-led 'Two by Two' and 'A Song for the Spanish Anarchists', both of which are strange and wonderful. 'Ceacescu' is a mixture of moaning layered voice, an endless electronic vibration, and ecstatic cheap keyboards dancing around the mix. These guys have made so much music together over the years, but what amazes me is how much continually stands out as exemplary, and this is another great record. [13 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This much-heralded composition comes no doubt from it's circumstances of origin, which are amazing; but it's also a beautiful and sad elegy that ocupies the mid-century modernist soundworld almost perfectly. The harmonies and dissonances are balanced throughout and there are moments that are so stark and dour (such as the 'Abîme des oiseaux' movement, which is just bare clarinet mostly) that they are almost unequaled in their misery. 'Danse de la fureur' opens side two with some fanfare but there's a dark undercurrent to this. Whenever the piano ascends triumphantly, the cello and clarinet cut in with a reminder of the cycle of time, ever progressing, always winding towards darkness. In the end of time, Messiaen actually imagines a whole world of timbre through the spare choices; it's dazzling and unparalleled in 20th century music. [10 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">So many of these old 2002 records I look at and think "Wow, has it been ten years already?" but with <i>Knife Play </i>it actually feels like it has been longer. Over the years I've come to really, really love this album, which I still find somewhat confounding despite it's familiarity. The electro-pulse tunes are kind of hit and miss, but Jamie Stewart excels when it comes to being delicate and fragile. Which is why, of post-<i>Knife Play</i> releases, nothing's ever quite done it for me apart from the more slow, acoustic tracks - 'Sad Pony Guerilla Girl' on their second album is probably the best thing they ever did. But here, the blueprint is set - absolutely warped teenage goth melodrama musique concrete noise-rock pop indie soul, and that's not even all of it. There's moments I still find spellbinding here, like the sloppy drum freakout at the end of 'Hives Hives', or the entirety of 'Dr. Troll' (the potential of which has never really been matched by anything I heard, save the abovementioned 'Sad Pony'). I wasn't ready for this in 2002 and maybe the world wasn't; it's odd that Xiu Xiu just ended up being a cult band, kind of, at least as far as I can tell (I've never really known any major fans, as it seems most people pick and choose from their discography like I do). This LP is still in pretty good shape, surprisingly, since it's packaged in a piece of newsprint. [5 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I'm a huge Mountain Goats fan, but my fandom only extends through <i>Full Force Galesburg</i> (a perfect, beautiful record that still brings me to my knees 15 years later). Everything after that is just all right, but it felt like a turning point - <i>The Coroner's Gambit</i> seemed a bit less intimate, and this one furthered my feelings. But actually, <i>All Hail West Texas</i> is a great accomplishment that's very much in the same vein as those early records I love so much. I guess I felt a bit of distance from Darnielle the narrator vs Darnielle himself -- those early songs, all the hundreds of 'Going to'/'Song for' format songs, all seemed like the ravings of a madman, and 100% true. I realise now that they were every bit as much characters as anything else, and that really, the record he did later about being abused is the most genuine Darnielle. At the same time, I think I want to believe in the 90's Darnielle as he presented himself, which is why I still find records like <i>Sweden</i> and <i>Zopilote Machine</i> not just great, but essential to my own adolescent development. At the time this came out, I thought it was okay, not amazing, but there are actually some incredible tunes here, and the whole record is done on the boombox, which is actually eulogised in the liner notes. I mean, this is at least as good as <i>Nothing for Juice</i>. 'Fault Lines' is among the greatest of the classic Darnielle narratives about love failing, and given what was going on with my life when this came out, it still really resonates. 'The Mess Inside' as well - this obsessive focus is something I feel is lacking from his recent work, and maybe that's another reason I don't listen as often. But yeah, this is actually pretty great. So I think I might need to extend my unequivocal fandom to 'all pre-4AD Mountain Goats' instead of stopping at <i>Galesburg </i>-- especially when I think about those great one-sided 12"s which came out after this.</p>

<p class="p1">The Extra Glenns were a supergroup to me in the late 90s, though listening now that seems funny, because they're nothing more than Mountain Goats songs with Franklin Bruno playing some extra instrumentation overtop and doing backing vocals. But that's a good formula, and the early tricklings of Extra Glenns material, specifically 'I Hear the Planets' from the Shrimper <i>Fantasy Band</i> 7" and the great, great, great 'Infidelity' 7", suggested a sum greater than the parts. Now that it's been over a decade since <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i> came out (during which time not another peep has been heard from the Extra Glenns), I can say that this was a real disappointment. The songs are good enough - about on par as the <i>All Hail West Texas</i>-era material, with a few standouts ('Ultra Violet', 'Somebody Else's Parking Lot in Sebastopol') but nothing nearly as great as that almost-infallible run that Darnielle had between <i>Beautiful Rat Sunset</i> and <i>Full Force Galesburg. </i>There's a wonderful piano-based cover of Leonard Cohen's 'Memories' which is awesome, and maybe my overall favourite track, but otherwise the novelty of this (Darnielle + good production + other instruments) soon became the norm for the Mountain Goats over the next decade, which makes this seem less special in retrospect. While I still love the guy and pay attention to what he releases, nothing's really resonated with me since <i>Galesburg</i>, which of course came out when I was 17 -- so I am realising that the problem is really with me. Why not just release this as a Mountain Goats album? There's a bunch of 'Going to' songs (which were abandoned by the Mountain Goats around this time) and 'Malevolent Seascape Y', a sequel I guess to the masterpiece on the Extra Glenns 7", but the input of Bruno is largely wasted here. Or maybe it just shows whose ego is bigger. [25 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">sounds pretty good. [2001] I saw Temple of Bon Matin at a crazy show in Lexington in 2003 or so, and if I only I had known what a privilege it had been, I might have appreciated it more. Actually I loved that show, but this record took me years to listen to again, as I often overlook it due to the lack of a spine. The crazy soup that is the Bon Matin is fully presented here, from the opening traditional "Muleskinner" which segues into the beautiful, distant "Shenadoah"; soon followed by the noisy, dirgy bashabout "Caledonia" (not a Cro-Magnon cover, or maybe it is). Ed Hardy's drumming is often the center though it's neither technically impressive nor even that rhythmically consistent. But he's th Svengali behind this collective and despite the variety, this is unmistakable with a consistent vision. The genres hop around - from outsider Americana to swinging free jazz ('Coloring Book' honestly sounds a bit like Cecil Taylor) to screaming helljams, but somehow it all works. On side two this melts together a bit into something uniquely wacked, with wet electric guitar solos akin to John McLaughlin, as well as Hasil Adkins-styled caterwauls. It's a really underrated record, much much better than I remember it -- it might be cool to see what they've been up to since. [28 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is the Sea Ensemble, one of ESP-Disk's most forgotten releases but one that I really cherish. Recorded in the mid 70's, the husband-and-wife team of Kali Fasteau and Don Garrett explore a variety of free melodies on all sorts of instruments. Disc 1 is a half-hour concert recorded in Holland and disc 2 is an hour recorded in Turkey. There's such a beautiful, organic language between these two that it sounds like one person and like many people at the same time. The reeds, strings, and numerous ethnic instruments are rotated constantly, and the live setting adds a lovely echo to things. The Turkish session was recorded badly so had noise reduction added which gives it a very strange, slightly malevolent vibe. Garrett speaks a bit at the beginning and the whole session, despite being light and airy, feels much more otherworldly. There's moments of piano playing that are wonderful and actually quite rooted in 'jazz', but for the most part it's more the free, flowing genre of human expression that Don Cherry's later work belongs to. The weird recording on the second disc makes some wow-and-flutter effects which give it a much more tripped out feel - some of the vocal glissandos on track 6, disc 2, are like an Henri Chopin recording, though with a spiritual, trance edge. This is such a mammoth blast of music to immerse oneself in, but it's genteel and provocative at the same time. [30 December 2012]</p>

There's some debate amongst the historians - generally Ornette Coleman gets the flag, or Cecil Taylor - and since Tristano is white, there's a whole other dynamic here. Anyway, neither track is particularly impressive - it's fits in well with these two sides of 'cool' jazz, just a bit more loose. DeFranco's side is somewhat brassier as the band is bigger, but it works well with Tristano - it's a split LP that was chosen well. But ultimately these tracks are little more than a historical curiosity for me. [7 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The Circle 2xLP is a classic, and a lynchpin in the argument for "early ECM". These four musicans cover a lot of different ground over the four sides of this. Beginning with a Wayne Shorter composition, which is relatively feelgood, side two quickly delves into some bird-like call and response between Braxton and Chick Corea. Braxton's angular playing, choosing tonal sides that are somewhat at odds with the relatively smooth timbre, makes a really interesting counterpoint to Corea's piano playing. Holland and Altschul are solid as ever, Holland's solos are stunning and his compositions, the side-long 'Toy Room' gets quite explosive and free at points, and the 'Song for the Newborn' is the highlight of the whole record. Compared to the ARC record I have, this is night and day, and Braxton is only part of the reason. [31 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Great white music! This Yo La Tengo record was a thrill when it came out because it was so relaxed and sophisticated - only 'Cherry Chapstick' is fast and rocking, while the rest focuses on the mellow atmospheric sounds on songs like 'The Crying of Lot G' and 'Our Way to Fall'. There's energy buried deep inside, manifested through slow organ drones, tremelo, and other effects. When there is a more upbeat tune - 'Let's Save Tony Orlando's House', 'You Can Have It All' - there's a real resistance to make the walls-of-sound that created previous classics like 'Deeper into Movies' and 'Blue Line Swinger'. Maybe this is just the sound of people getting older, but I'm getting older too, and I loved this when I was 20 as well as now. And these aren't exactly ballads - just songs of twilight and contemplation. This is a wonderful double vinyl package, with side four dedicated in its entirety to 'Night Falls on Hoboken', a gentle folk-indie jam that closes out what is sadly the last truly great Yo La Tengo record. Their subsequent releases have all been great - it's hard to say anything truly bad about YLT - but the run from <i>Painful</i> to this one is just about perfect, so night falling is an appropriate metaphor.

This is wooly, melancholic, and almost disturbing in points.  [6 Aug 2011]</p>

It reminds me a ton of <i>Warehouse: Songs and Stories</i>, but without (I never thought I'd say it) the pleasure of Grant Hart's songs. 'Brasilia Crossed with Trenton' is a the most interesting lyric here, even if it's intoned over fairly drab accompaniment.

<p class="p1">For what is (I think) their last record together, Richard and Linda put the nail in the coffin of their marriage, in the process making a great, dark record. Breaking up in public ain't easy, and the cover image should say a lot, with a desperate, despondent Richard staring ahead in a dark room, Linda only a photographic presence above him. The record actually feels more unified than that, with some hard-edged guitar work on the title track, the likes of which we haven't heard since 'Calvary Cross'. Linda's voice is beautiful as ever, with 'Walking on a Wire' being my pick of the album - a slow, delicate ballad built around uncertainty. The dramatics of 'Did She Jump or Was She Pushed?' are probably the most over-the-top moment but it works, for this is a record about sinking into the darkness, and all the false comfort that comes with it.

<p class="p1">A lovely old Folkways release, this begins with a spoken introduction and then gives itself over to numerous recordings of singing, chanting, and the barest of instrumentation. Usually accompanied by just one drum, or just a wooden block or clicking sound, the voices here are deep and confident. It's split evenly between male and female vocals and it was recorded I think in New York, though it uses "real" Africans. It's primarily recordings from the Ewe and Ghanian traditions. Incidentally, this is the first record on my shelf as I file compilations first by title and this is alphabetically the first thing I have. [25 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The first Art Bears album is perfect, but then isn't everything they did just about infallible? This is built around dark, moving songs with unbelievably beautiful lyrics, sung in Dagmar Krause's distinctive voice and with Frith and Cutler fucking about with songforms. There's some very strange chordal movements, with violins and keyboards and guitars and drums building something that sounds somehow ancient, yet furturistic. 'The Dance' is a good example of this - like something out of <i>The Seventh Seal</i>, with a dance that is medieval yet 20th century as you can imagine. 'In Two Minds' is utterly anthemic, the longest and most memorable song on the record, which thunders down in that Henry Cow way, but with a lighter elegance. Art Bears were a gamechanger for me - they illustrated the balance between political/social conviction and aesthetic innovation, something that I still struggle with all the time in everything I do.

<p class="p1">Spencer's first LP feels like so long ago, which I guess it was. At the time it was such a big deal for one of my friends to have a vinyl release, though I'm sure none of us had any idea how many more would follow this. I used to always see 'A Brighter Summer Day' as a perfect, thunderous summation of Spencer's organic one-man sound explosion. The rich violin and circular, rolling percussion is a great statement, at times recalling Tony Conrad or Angus MacLise's work in the late 60s. 'Baybe It Wasn't Meant To Me' on the B-side is an entirely different beast - a very rough collage that juxtaposes dense, swirling sound fragments with computer-processed synth, with very clean edits instead of fades. At the time I remember feeling that this was a somewhat lesser cut, but today's ears find a logic that eluded the younger me. [18 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The lone Frank Wright Trio begins with a sprawling band improvisation that looks in every direction except the center. It feels lazy and unfocused - as free as anything else from the time, but substituting cunning for fire. The band keeps sidestepping each other, and the occasional flareup from Wright's sax bell keep it demanding the listener's attention. 'The Moon', 14 minutes across the second half, amps up the energy to the proper ESP level. Henry Grimes is miscredited on drums but actually I guess is the bass, and his weird sense of motion is as brilliant as on the Ayler albums, if Wright's sax isn't quite as thundering. It's overall a nice piece and the record is enjoyable, a bit of a different flavour, but nothing spectacular. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Pele are an interesting case, as they emerged from the 90s guitar-indie scene, with emo leanings, that produced the Promise Ring and a whole now-forgotten scene of bands I never liked. They were always a bit brainer and to be honest, I never really listened to them apart from a live concert in Pittsburgh on their last tour where they stayed at my house. I was already interested in drummer Jon Mueller and guitarist Chris Rosenau's other work, released on their Crouton label. I've since lost touch with that too, which is a shame, because they made a series of great, invigorating recordings of experimental music that I was way into ten years ago. This is possibly the last Pele release - a song called 'Realize It' which is instrumental guitar post-rock, crisp and bright like Directions in Music or something like that. The second track is a long workout, not the same theme but from probably the same recording session. It's very pleasant and has several movements, and it's a nice little EP swansong and oddly the only thing I really know by them. [30 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Over</i> is built around a song called 'Under' by Jarboe, processed and manipulated by Telecognac, a group consisting of Chris Rosenau and Jon Mueller that I really liked about twelve years ago. Telecognac released one incredible CD called <i>Memory </i>and those guys also played in Pele and Collections of Colonies of Bees - for a short time I was really actively following the Crouton label, and they crashed at my place in Pittsburgh on the last Pele tour though I barely remember anything about them now. This CD continues their excellent approach to cut-up yet organic experimentalism, using piano, guitars, and drums through a very digital treatment  (there's a part on track 1 that just sounds like Jarboe's voice being skipped around on a CD, which is actually mesmerising). These guys really found a niche that pushed open areas of pure sound candy beauty, with elements of nostalgia and warm, earthy repetitions. The third track is haphazard, sounding like it's never quite getting going, and the low point though still well-constructed. Jarboe was surely a willing participant though she is only a distant presence; I wish this was longer, actually. [1 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The first of Ajax/3BOS's compilations of early, essential Mountain Goats 7"s, compilation tracks, and cassettes is pretty indispensible to me. I have a bunch of these tracks anyway, which is why they feel so familiar to me - I can't listen to 'Night of the Mules' without beginning to tap along and sing the words I've listened to for so many years. The first 3 proper cassettes have been left off these - <i>Taboo VII</i> , which Darnielle opposed the release of for years (and for pretty good reason), and then the amazing <i>Hound Chronicles</i> and <i>Hot Garden Stomp</i>, which thankfully I own anyway on Shrimper originals -- so these compilations essentially completed my Mountain Goats collection in terms of physical media in one fell swoop, with the one exception of <i>Nothing for Juice </i>which I'll pick up eventually. It's hard for me to write anything critical about these songs - there's tons of them (and two more discs after this) and they generally revolve around the same obsessions and are musically uninventive. But this was a religion for me, founded through this material which I hunted down like a rabid fanboy, aged 16, convinced that this secret world of bedroom troubadours would light my path to salvation. Many favourites here I have played and replayed over the years - 'Love Cuts the Strings', 'Alphabetizing', 'Duke Ellington' -- and then there are gems such as 'The Window Song' and the entire <i>Yam, The King of Crops</i> cassette which I had never previously heard.

<p class="p1">Mountain Goats early works compilation volume 2 proceeds through the same unimpeachable territory as the first one, though I think this volume most deals with material I'm not familiar with - only three 7" singles from this CD appear in my record accumulation and two of those are compilations (though 'Song for an Old Friend' from <i>The Wheel Method</i> is incredible). The <i>Transmissions to Horace</i> cassette is probably the earliest material on here, which I had never heard before, and it's a brilliant work, beginning with 'Going to Cleveland'' and getting into 'Going to Monaco's' rant about standing on the sand six inches away ... these songs are easy to parody, but they came from a place so genuine and fruitful that I will always love them. 'No, I Can't' appears in two different forms as does the cover of Ace of Base's 'The Sign'. [22 August 2012]</p>

I'm going to explore what I've been missing - there's a decade of surely brilliant music he's made that I haven't paid any attention to and that's not for any reason except that my mind gets cluttered. This record is such a masterpiece - it's long but satisfying. It packs in a zillion ideas but keeps an approachable honesty that really recalls the same influences I had, especially at the time. It's all done so artfully, with a beautiful recording style, addictive hooks, and a somber, delicate tone through everything. Listening now for the first time in years I'm remembering a bunch of songs that I used to know intimately - it's a familiar, inspiring old friend. [23 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The followup to <i>New Boots and Panties</i> is a really tight, almost disco-influenced pub-rock album. The band is crisp, a slave to the rhythm, and adorned with saxophone solos and waka-chika guitars. Over all of this, Dury's bizarre cockney voice wails away, appearing as an amusing affront to the music. Ironic to call it <i>Do It Yourself</i> when it's heavily produced, or maybe this was a tongue-in-cheek reference to Desperate Bicycles and all that stuff going on at the same time? The songs are pretty good, though when Dury tries to get more emotional ('Don't Ask Me' being a good example) it falls a bit flat. Overall it's a step back from <i>New Boots and Panties</i>, an album I thought I owned but I apparently lost along the way, but there are a few songs I really like - the less dancebeat ones, such as 'This Is What We Find' and 'Sink My Boats'.

<p class="p1">Side A is a very ethereal, echoey drone with hand percussion and wordless vocals rising and falling. It's a cult-like trance, a far cry from the more overtly surreal sounds on other VtB stuff of this time, and much more showing their influences of the Third Ear Band and artists like that. The B-side begins in the same vein, though a bit more active (but just as straight-ahead in terms of rhythm). Acoustic strings are plucked and bowed, and when the second track, 'All the Paint I can Breathe' comes in, we're suddenly cast into a nightmarish 50's sci-fi freak zone. It's one of the more compelling tracks in the VtB canon and the highlight of the record for sure. The closing track is actually called 'Volcano the Bear' and it's like a summation of all the previous tracks. [9 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I ordered this semi-randomly because the description sounded intriguing and it's become a familiar presence over the years. Confusional Quartet were an Italian progressive rock band that bled into new-wave territory - their output was from 1980-81 and thus reflected the more aggressive elements of punk, yet still with an extremely musical angle. This certainly descends from fast and furious riffs like you'd hear on an Area record, but with production techniques that are closer to American punk. Though instrumental, 'Bologna Rock' could be a Mission of Burma tune, or even something by the Embarassment. But there's also a mad, edgy intensity throughout that leads me to think of them as being influenced by Futurism. Which is probably just a quick and easy assumption because they are Italians. The synthesisers are key here, often the lead instrument, over scraggly guitars. It's not as confusing as their name would indicate but it's definitely good. [18 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This set collects rembetika music, a genre of Greek folk music that chronicles drug addiction, homelessness, disease, suicide, and other such topics. I've always loved the contrast between the cheerfulness of the bouzoukis and the dour nature of the lyrics here, though without a grasp of the language I'm certainly missing out on the best part. Though I don't actually understand them, being in Greek, and the liner notes are mostly in German, there are excerpts of lyrics in the back in English and brief summaries of the topics covered. Some of which translate just great: 'Mama, I've got TB / I've got a lot of TB....' I don't love rembetika music because of a fetish for transgressive content specifically; it's really that I enjoy the overall aesthetic of these tunes, which sound dirty, raw, and sun-drenched. Plus, I like Greek music in general, but often find it over-recorded or too formal - which this is most certainly not. The instrumentals are fantastic and have that rembetika style. Some of the fingerpicking is dazzlingly rapid, but sounds lazy and tossed off, a vibe I get from Rick Bishop's playing sometimes. Here's it's often fast and slow at the same time. With two stuffed discs, this is a lot to taken in, and I usually only listen to one at a time - without any grasp on the language I admit they start to blend together. But it's a great set overall; Trikont is a pretty great label for things like this. [1 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Another tight, crisp Andrew Hill record that unfortunately does not have Dolphy on it or any brass, actually. Elvin Jones does his thing, providing a warm, supportive bed of rhythm especially on cuts like 'Flea Flop' and the title track (spelled incorrectly, oddly) - and occasionally fires off some confident, reverberating solos. Again, I'm taken by Hill's compositional ability even if this record is easy to tune into muzak mentaly from all the piano and vibe interplay. I'm not a big vibes fan, as instruments, but this is really solid and avoids cliches through the dark, moody cadences and excellent musicianship. [11 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Genesis are a band that I kinda like, but not a lot, and I've always been happy just having this one record by them. The theatrics of Peter Gabriel have always pushed them quite closer to the ELP side of prog, which is sometimes great (the triumphant, screeching electric guitars can be nice) and sometimes bland. This has really overdone stuff like 'The Battle of Epping Forest' and 'Dancing With the Moonlit Knight', which is good, especially when it gets all ethereal and delicate; it's the jams that are sometimes less inspiring, especially after listening to an Area record yesterday. But maybe I'm being too hard on Genesis, and letting the horrible 80s pop stuff colour my appreciation - I used to like this record a lot. And actually, the Phil sung 'More Fool Me' is a perfect little pop song. [8 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">You gotta love <i>Malesch</i>, which is built around slow, creeping jams. It's recorded in a middle-range fidelity, which makes the excursions into subcontinental folk forms feel authentically wispy.  Side one sets the mood, and the murkiness really carries a dark, malevolent mood. The second side opens with the most interesting clash of rhythms and melodies before moving into a more loose, epic guitar workout with garbled, backwards vocals. It's a long record but right when it's about to overstay its welcome, it crashes to a conclusion. [16 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I really like Kip Hanrahan's early work, even though it's sometimes awkward and overly coffeeshop-tasting. But I like coffee, and awkward. This seems to be the work of a very articulate artist who primarily works with voice and percussion, but much closer to spoken word than singing. The tracks are a who's who of genius musicians, with Chico Freeman, Arto Lindsay, Anton Fier, Byard Lancaster, Carla Bley, George Cartwright, Teo Macero, Bill Laswell, Michael Mantler, Cecil McBee and Billy Bang, to name some. It's often a jazz-rock hybrid, but heavily congo-based, giving everything a Latin pulse. The interplay between the musicians is the reason to listen, not to discount Hanrahan's own vocalising; one feels almost like he has 'coordinated' these musicians, rather than properly composing an album. His voice is soft and he's actually quiet most of the time, so the players can breathe. It never sounds like a drum circle - if anything, cuts like 'This Night Comes Out of Both Of Us' could be later Raincoats or Slits material, especially with Lisa Herman's subdued, breathy vocals. The lyrics push through boundaries of intimacy at time ('I want you to break me' jumps out) though they are easy to tune out; I suspect they should paid attention to, however. [13 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Hemphill stakes out a real voice here on this, his second record after <i>Dogon A.D. </i>His band, with Hamiet Bluiett and Barry Altschul, starts off slow, as 'Reflections' and 'Lyric' unfold as carefully-composed meditations. But then 'Skin 1' kicks in, around a funky congo part with Abdul Wadud's cello keeping a motorik riff over which the horns can fuck around with each other. 'The Hard Blues' on side two is very much that - a slow, mournful blues progression that develops over about 20 minutes. The cello sounds like a guitar here and it stays back, with Philip Wilson just tapping out a bare beat and letting Hemphill and Bluiett and Baikada Carroll (on trumpet) go at it. By the end it's a giant, psychedelic mess that never lets go of the blues progression, and it's a powerful sound. [3 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The second Matching Mole record is heavily rooted in Marxist imagery and also built around all non-Wyatt compositions. If you like "hot" electric piano, there's plenty to enjoy here -- though it doesn't sound miles away from a Soft Machine stuck permanently between their second and third albums. The musicianship is enjoyable and it avoids the sameyness of most jazz-rock. Wyatt's vocalisin' is pretty abstract, especially on a jam like 'Nan's True Hole', which gets thick and burning. I'm starting to get a little sick of prog, and so this is maybe not the best time to listen to the first side. But then on the second half, 'Gloria Gloom' starts things off as a delicious bit of dark ambience, then fading into a recording of a conversation - it's like the Pizza A Go-Go record! (But not really). But it is the highlight of what's otherwise a good record, if inferior to the self-titled. [25 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I never really knew what to make of this second Mekons album which was sort of their 'last' album before the breakup and rebirth. It's sometimes called <i>Devils, Rats and Piggies</i> which is a nicer name and it's a very transitional, experimental album that isn't like anything else they ever did except their other transitional, experimental albums (<i>Me</i> comes to mind). What strikes me about it now after a good listen is how contemporary it sounds - 'Snow', the first cut, could totally be some hipsters making music in Berlin today. There's a much more mellow approach, making this a true art-rock record and leaving the scraggle of <i>Quality of Mercy </i>behind. 'Corporal Chalkie' is one of my favourite Mekons songs, but I didn't love it until I heard the Sally Timms-crooned version on <i>Punk Rock, </i>which has retroactively made me love the original. This feels like it could be rediscovered by others, not just me. [18 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The Mekons first album is such a ragged listen. It's well-recorded and very much a solid selection of songs, but this bears so little resemblance to the Mekons as they became even just a few years later. A few of these songs were re-recorded for <i>Punk Rock</i> and the melodic beauty is not so apparent in these original versions, like 'What'. The songwriting team is quite a bit different than later - no Langford is present, as least not as a songwriter, and there's a different vocalist who I think was named Kevin and didn't rejoin for the <i>Fear and Whiskey </i>era. The vocals have the working-class punk rock tonality that is very 1980; 'Lonely and Wet' and 'Join Us In the Countryside' are nearly epic, except they are not. There is a melodic sophistication at play on songs like 'After 6' and 'Watch the Film' which is executed all wrong, but it's kinda great. 'Dan Dare' ends the whole thing in an appropriate exuberant mess. [1 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The title of this is appropriate for parts, which take Mantler and Bley's forward-thinking jazz (I hate to use the word fusion but with Larry Coryell and Tony Williams, this does actually "rock") and implements a Morricone-influenced soundtrack vibe. The music is tightly composed, though Steve Swallow, Mantler, and Bley definitely get to stretch out at places. I prefer this to later Mantler stuff, which takes on too much of a sheen. No one could ever accuse <i>Movies</i> of being sloppy, but there's still a strong sense of fun here - like the more rock parts of <i>Escalator Over the Hill</i>. Anything from the late 70's with Larry Coryell is worth hearing, and this is no exception. [27 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Robert Wyatt's only pre-disability solo album is a fun, fast romp. It starts and finishes with 'Las Vegas Tango', full of skittery piano, lively start-stop drums, and wacky layered vocals everywhere.  The middle tracks are all dedicated to different people. 'To Mark Everywhere' has brass from Mark Charig and Elton Dean, backwards tracked studio tricks, and then it gets progressively more weird. The improv bits are wild - 'To Nick Everyone' sputters out like a melted overlay of several simultaneous British jazz records. Side two begins with a mellow dedication to Caravan, with piano chords that hint at the progressions to come on <i>Rock Bottom</i> and subsequent work. Overall I'm generally impressed that this record is a wildly innovative experiment that uses color, mood, and studio trickery to create it's madness instead of relying on technical ability. The overall effect is quite lively and surreal, and it's a record I should listen to more often because there's a lot to be inspired by within. [14 August 2012]</p>

The band is a mis of American and British artists, with both piano by Terry Adams and organ by Bley. Bley's own playing has the tendency towards fusiony vamps, but, hey, it's 1977 after all. The tuba of Bob Stewart reaches low, low, low and Michael Mantler's whole 'space trumpet' sound is in full effect. The second side ends with a big medley jam around 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and it's presented quite enthusiastically, not at all tongue-in-cheek, though maybe I'm misreading it. [5 Aug 2012]</p>

Like I feel about most of Branca's work, this makes me think 'So what?' - trying to merge minimalist composition with punk rock is a noble idea, except that punk rock is already a minimal form of rock. Since I like that early 80s post-punk sound - this could be Mission of Burma (or more accurately, Birdsongs of the Mesozoic) - this is an enjoyable romp. But is it earth-shattering?

The Fire Engines are pretty well-regarded among Scottish post-punkers and I personally prefer their rougher cacophony to bands like Josef K or Orange Juice. Through the sharp edges and the funky dance-orientated rhythm section, there's a confidence that I like; nothing twee or hesitating here. There's a lot of instrumental here which are pretty enjoyable - not as herky-jerky as Stickmen, not as experimental as the Pop Group, but a fun relic of music being made in my former home in the year I was born.

'The Blacksmith', which opens it up, has a crunchy cadence which gives a minor-key shine to Prior's haunting voice. Martin Carthy is exemplary here when singing, though the fiddle playing is relegated to the accompaniment role except on the instrumentals and jig bits. This feels like a really tight, cohesive band, and the arrangements have enough of a rock basis that it doesn't feel as rooted in the traditional; more like the familiar. I have a disproportional amount of British folk/rock on my shelves in relation to how often I actually want to listen to it, but this is one to keep going back to. [30 November 2012]</p>

Certainly there is something really truly great about this record - a genre-defying mishmash of free-jazz, punk, and dance with an experimental edge, all wrapped up in angry, Ex-like political rants. But while 12 years ago this band was blowing my mind, these days I feel less moved by it. I love the really fucked up, open pieces like 'Strange Sea' but the polemic shouting songs don't do as much for me these days. I guess asking for the Pop Group to write empathetic songs that I can relate to is silly, so maybe it's just Mark Stewart who I tire of. The piano playing and really all of the jazzy bits are great - this was a real true fusion not found by many others of their era. The record is generally dark and atmospheric, even on songs like 'We Are Time' I'm reminded of early Cure (!). [27 November 2012]</p>

The band is really playful and the somber, political stuff hasn't taken shape yet The horns give everything a fusion vibe and it's only on the introduction to 'Teenbeat' that they start to really get wild and open with the sound. Frith's guitar chords at the beginning of side two are among the most traditional, yet charming he's ever sounded, and he sonds like Eddie Van Halen one track later on the 'Teenbeat' reprise. The little bits of singing here are lovely and just the right amount - it's a shame they never really did anymore besides what Krause added. [27 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Maybe the best overall Henry Cow recording, even though it's live - because the recording quality is fantastic and the highly improvisational nature of this band really shines in a live setting. Side 1 is a tour de force, dominated by Dagmar's voice and built around a thundering 'Beautiful as the Moon' to open and close it. Side two brings in Robert Wyatt, and the band gets into a faithful, awesome rendition of 'Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road', which starts with Frith chugging along on a dirty sounding electric guitar - it's practically the opening chords to 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. This is followed by an epic version of 'Ruins', ending with crashing fanfare and an appropriate comedown. The second LP is really where the free-rock chops shine, built around collective improvisations in Oslo and Udine. This runs the gamut from in-sync prog rock cadences to completely wild improvisations. The free playing, especially when the reeds are guitar are going, is of course much closer to the British school of brainy, restrained explorations than any sort of free-prog stuff - namely, it's not much like Area's contrapuntal explosions. But there's nothing too showoffty, and a general dark vibe saturates it all. Music like this is continually inspiring to me for the way in which it brings politics into the fold without compromising musical innovation. A classic. [4 Aug 2012]</p>

This is an all-synthesizer group, apparently a showcase of sorts for Robert Moog, but they really know how to make music as a band. As you'd expect there are long, slow passages here of pure electronic moods. A bit of vocals and some electric piano, but mostly this is the land of patch cables. It's tinged with darkness but they manage to extract something truly naturalistic out of sound sources so completely synthesised. Harmony, rather than dissonance, is the main goal here, but there are moments where the different frequencies start to clash and it created a nice unsettling buzz. It would be cool to check out what else they'd done over the years as I believe they've got an extensive discography. [28 November 2012]</p>

I really love this work by Ockeghem; it's built around nine male vocalists, with the odd medieval instrumentation often buried underneath. What I find so impressive about this music is how "modern" and contemporary it actually is. The melodies are like this long, unceasing tapestry that keeps getting unrolled. It's a construction that feels more akin to 1960's minimalism than any of the Western classical canon - an eternal music, always rolling towards a devotional core. There's also a piece by Desprez which is a lamentation on the death of Ockeghem and sounds pretty similar - with maybe a bit more of deeper hue. The male voices really run the range of sounds - there are tenors here who sound absolutely feminine. I'd be curious to see how this music is notated. [29 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is the famous, epic Shirley and Dolly Collins record, or at least the one where their genius is most evident. The counterpoint of Shirley's voice against Dolly's instrumental movement is what I like, more than any sense of traditional-revival Britishisms. The organs and medieval flavours are what Dolly's famous for but when it's strings being bowed, I just love it. Call me traditional about my traditionals, though I guess these are medieval string instruments in many cases. The case for Dolly Collins as a psychedelic warrior can be made depending on your definition of psychedelia - certainly this is a rich, colourful musical palette, so that's enough for me. I'm not British and around 2007 started to develop a bit of distate for this music, but when I listen to songs like 'Lowlands' now I can't help but be moved by their weight and power.

<p class="p1">This Heat has been maybe my single biggest influence in making music (though I'm not sure how obvious that is by what I've recorded/released). This final statement is concise and perfect. It pushes the two extremes of the band to different sides - the construction of 'Health and Efficiency' versus the free exploroation of the studio in 'Graphic Varispeed'. I've listened a thousand times but I'm glad to actually own it. [13 Sept 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">When I came across this curiosity I grabbed it on a whim. The band name recalled the line 'We've got 25 rifles just to keep the population down' from Neil Young's 'Revolution Blues' so I thought that was a good sign. Lo and behold, this 4 song EP actually features a cover of that song! But not a good one, except for the guitar solo. 25 Rifles are a band that perfectly mixes early Jam with Elvis Costello's earliest sound. That's not a bad sound - 'Little Girl' in particular is a fun, sprightly pop song and the production is crisp, the performance on point. They're actually a pretty good band and this was their only ever shot at anything, so they get relegated to history's bin. [25 September 2012]</p>

Even though this lacks the crazy vocals of Suzuki or Mooney, it's still a great record. Can becomes a bit more focused here without the frontman distraction, working on their rhythmic side with Jaki Leibzeit coming to the forefront here. The singing is unobtrusive if indistinct, but it's good; 'Come Sta, La Luna' is a wild herky-jerky ride, and 'Splash' rides things out on an epic jam. But no matter how enjoyable <i>Soon Over Babaluma</i> is, it's always going to be the one really good Can album that you forget about and never recognise any of the songs from. [29 November 2012]</p>

There's a lot of soft wind here - flutes, other woody things, and a general Art Ensemble-like focus on small sounds and little instruments. The centre of the album is a bit more active - the 'Bass Figure for Balatune' is built around repetitive pianos, pounding like a 60's minimalist composition; 'Moving Pictures for the Ear' takes on the more active, tribal drumming that is found on records like <i>Orient</i> and <i>Blue Lake</i>, with the requisite vocalising. This feels like an important step before the creation of the mighty <i>Brown Rice</i>. [1 December 2012]</p>

This isn't one I spin often but when I do I keep going back to the haunting vocal hymn 'My Only Child', which is about the pinnacle of Ms. Nico expressing a dynamic gamut of emotions with just her voice. This is in many ways an insight into what a Cale/Nico-led VU would have been like; maybe cross 'Janitor of Lunacy' with 'Sister Ray' and you get the greatest thing ever imagined that never actually happened. The cover makes me think of Arrabal films and that's probably quite deliberate; the child vocals on 'Le Petit Chevalier' as well recall the <i>Viva la Muerte</i> song. I don't know if it's the Nico record I pull out the most, but maybe listening more scarcely is a sign of a deeper appreciation. [18 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Chico Freeman's second LP begins with a long exploratory track called 'MOMENTS', starting with just Chico and Cecil McBee, who's a really underrated bassist, I think. They take their time stretching out, and there's a really up-front, close studio tone that is soft, inviting, and meandering in a good way. I guess Chico (Von Freeman's son) is a minor AACM player; Muhal Richard Abrams and Steve McCall are here too, but only on side 2 -- so this is a pretty solid, familiar lineup. Some great bits when McBee is bowing and Freeman is really laying on the low register and it's totally lockstep. Side two, 'Merger' maintains a light, airy feel as the full band is playing, and there's a second percussionist so it's super Latin feeling at points, or a bit like that one Crimson record with the second percussionist. There's standard moments of solos - Abrams lets one rip right at the beginning which I like because of how faraway it sounds - and a really cohesive feel. As good as 'Merger' is, it's nothing on the first side - the McBee/Freeman duet - because that really stakes out a unique voice. [13 July 2012]</p>

This is the step Colin Newman was ready to make, as it was becoming increasingly clear what his role was in the band. I'm not discounting Bruce Gilbert, but watching the live video that McDowell found, it's pretty obvious to me that his role was being gradually reduced. This is like <i>154</i> part 2 (<i>155</i>?) but a bit more focused, and with some really catchy parts. Art-rock at it's finest. [2 January 2004]</p>

<p class="p1">I really like Andrew Hill's records for Blue Note because he's a great composer and assembled a hell of a band too. This has Dolphy on it, and he's really tricky at times, playing around with the tenor player and generally avoiding the complete focus. Hill's own playing is not flashy; it's solid, and subtle, and when it seems that he's really more concerned with holding together the centre instead of trying to take charge, you then realise he's gone on some dazzling run that you barely noticed.. With Dolphy, you can do that - the saxes and trumpet at times weave beautiful ballads ('Dedication'), and there's the post-bop momentum through most other tracks. 'Flight 19' has them at their most furtive, with the rhythm section able to stop on a dime and change direction. There's so much colour in this music that it's remarkable really, while still adhering to conventional styles.  A young Tony Williams is on drums too, making this a historically underrated band at a critical point in several careers.

<p class="p1">Don Ellis's work is beautiful and Appollonian, building small orchestra pieces around his trumpet. He's like a white Miles Davis in that way - though not as adventurous or distinct, but in the <i>Sketches of Spain</i> sort of way. This record is built around the idea of Japanese haikus and the sketches are often saccharine, often melodramatic, but always pleasing. Every time I think about tossing this record out I give it a listen and find something comforting in it, even though this is a long way from the edge of the <i>French Connection</i> soundtrack. The band, despite it's size and studio construction, can actually swing - cuts like 'Parting' make a nice contrast to the more soundtracky numbers, reminding us that Ellis is (or at least once was) rooted in 'jazz'. The cover is wonderfully psychedelic too. [26 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I love Henry Cow's last record, which is a lot different while not reinventing the wheel. John Greaves is gone and the two sides are given over to compositions by Tim Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper, so it's almost like Frith and Cutler can just concentrate on playing, rather than leading. Of course, there's brilliant improvisatory moments by both of them, though this feels like the most tightly composed of any of their records. The Hodgkinson side actually reminds me of industrial music at times, and industry is certainly the image they were trying to conjure here. It returns to anthemic progressive rock licks for the ending 'On a Raft' which switches around instrumentation between the members but is stellar. Cooper's side has searing licks and is quite a distance from her solo album, which has much more of a songy, Brechtian influence. It ends on an uplifting, brisk jam which suggests these guys had so much more to offer the world, but sadly, this was it. [13 Aug 2012]</p>

On the flipside he gets out the flute and it really takes it time to rev up, not so concerned with getting anywhere which is nice. Olu Dara's is a fairly unheralded trumpet player who gives this a nice, bold exuberance, particularly when placed against Bluiett's odd bari-tones. [15 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Tara pointed out that it was just Rober Wyatt's birthday so I gave this a spin to get me pumped for Super Bowl Sunday, though it'd admittedly an odd choice.  I've always loved this album because its so eclectic - lively and somber at the same time, and with some really great arrangements.  My old faves have always been "Team Sprit" and "Song for Che", but today I really loved the Offenbach piece, specifically how playfully Wyatt's "imitation electric piano" is.  He tinkles on the keys in a way that injects a really silly spirit into the chord cadences, and it makes Offenbach much more playful than one would expect.  This is also one of my favorite album covers of all-time - it perfectly captures the mood of the record with a really unique, surrealistic style. I think this record is often overlooked since it came out around the same time as <i>Rock Bottom</i> and it's isn't as introspective or personal, but it's still one of Wyatt's best records and it's a template for fruitful art-prog-rock ideas.   It foreshadows the 80s period where he performed a lot of covers but still has some originals; it really feels like a turning point between Soft Machine/<i>End of an Ear</i> and the unique style of his subsequent material.

I mean, even among his pre-<i>Swordfishtrombones</i> output, like <i>Nighthawks</i>, there's a wrecked depression to it all. But this sounds more like Jimmy Webb - folk-tinged romanticism (some of it quite touching, like 'I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You') and some country-rock stompers ('Rosie'). It's a pretty good debut, I guess, though it doesn't even hint at what's to come. I can't see myself listening to this much unless I were to really dedicate myself to exploring some of the songs, but time will prevent that, and I enjoy listening to <i>Rain Dogs</i> and <i>Frank's Wild Years</i> so much lately that this isn't likely to get much of my Waits attention.

<p class="p1">There's more than one reason to own this record. The biggest is to have <i>I Want To See the Bright Lights Tonight</i>, an album I would definitely rank in the 'all-time classics' category. I don't have the standalone LP so this release thankfully includes it as the first disc. There's not much to say that hasn't already been said about <i>Bright Lights</i>; it's a sophisticated blend of misery and company, a landmark album that (due to the doomed marriage of Richard and Linda) works on several subtextual levels. The live portion is the second LP (whether it's more or less would require me counting the minutes and seconds, which I don't care to do) and featured a series of songs on side C and two long jams on side D. It's these final cuts that really make it - 'Night Comes In' and 'Calvary Cross', both recorded very clearly and with the sort of extended jams/solos you'd imagine would justify their running them. Thompson's less polished live vocals add something to this - 'Oh this night, like no other' sounds a bit strained, the way it should be. 'Calvary Cross' on <i>Bright Lights</i> is almost unbearably heavy for a non-hard rock band; the hesitations on the thundering rhythm breaks are absolutely beautiful. The live version is a bit lighter actually, with the accordion really bleeding through, bu the solos are longer and Thompson really takes his time to develop a theme. It's such a beautiful, strong and painful song that it might even be my favourite one on <i>Bright Lights </i>because of how this live version presents it. [30 November 2012]</p>

Altschul and Holland are a great pair, and I've probably written somewhere else here about how underrated I think Dave Holland is. The title track is the craziest - the piano sounds like it's exploding, opening up while at the same time falling in on itself. This Dadaist intrusion is definitely the high point of the first side, but the second side get really wild. 'Games' does this nutty volume changing doppler effect thing, and by the end, I'm thinking that I should really investigate some of Dave Holland's solo work.

<p class="p1">I bought this pretty much randomly, and it's become one of those idiosyncratic records that I love that no one else has ever heard of. I play 'Jaguar' probably every time I DJ (which is not often); it resembles a scarier, maudlin Pylon with this most incredibly repeating swelling pulse. As simple as it is - another new wave/post-punk experiment to be forgotten - the feel of this is something that's been tremendously influential on me and I've tried to emulate in my own work (unsuccessfully, and I can't even point any any explicit examples, but trust me, the intent is there all the time). The other three songs aren't bad - actually, they range from good to great; overall, I'd say Band Apart are an incredibly underrated band. Until now it had never even occured to me that there might be more Band Apart out there beyond these four songs; the Internet tells me they had a full-length called <i>Marseille</i>. Time to hunt it down, though to be honest, I'm happy enough with 'Jaguar'. [1 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $4.46</p>
<p class="p1">This is a great concept - Barre Phillips invited three other bassists to make a record of improvisations and compositions, with only Stu Martin's drumming to join them. The channels are split so Barre is hard left, Barry Guy soft left, Martin in the middle, Palle Danielsson soft right, and J.F. Jenny-Clarke hard right. The result is an experiment that is incredibly rewarding. The opening cut sets the pace with a really rolling, active jam, accessible and fun too - but still messy and chaotic and all the bass strings flop all over each other and it's a pleasure to sort it all out. As the record progresses we get some beautiful bowed harmonies, some purely sketch-like improv, and a feeling of cohesion that is remarkable, given the unusual instrumentation. I've always though Phillips a bit underrated, though to be honest, I don't really single out his playing here despite the hard panning - it's his vision and compositional approach that I like so much.

<p class="p1">This is a great, great Jansch record, maybe the best. And such a flattering cover! Renbourn plays second guitar on a few tracks but this is mostly Jansch doing traditionals, including a great '900 Miles' and the stunning title track, which has some fanastic pre-Pentangle interplay with Renbourn. The instrumental opener has some banjo, enough to leave me wanting more, but the guitar playing is sharp and nihilistic at points - an agressive take on familiar tunes. 'Jack Orion' is epic, really - a great example of how these old Vanguard records keep on giving so many years later. [17 December 2012]</p>

The six jazz-rock tunes on here are pretty okay I guess, but apart from John Greaves's 'Squarer for Maud' which has some crunching keyboards and Peter Blegvad muttering about something, it's in-one-ear-out-the-other prog rock competence. Greaves sings on 'Binoculars' which is probably my favourite track, quite charming in it's casual lyrics. But overall I'm not into this much. [17 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a pretty stomping, excellent late 70's Ornette Coleman record that gets really into the fusion-rock side. But the rock that Coleman embraces is punchy, jerky Beefheartian skronk. Most of the record is built around an endless circular sax lick, around which a busy lineup, including Ronald Shannon Jackson, rocks the fucking jams. It's so endless that it splits over two sides, during which everyone gets their chance to solo. The other track features the Master Musicians of Jajouka and it's also great - a departure from the fusion, sure, but no less free and active. [24 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Pierre Bensusan's second album is one of those random gems that I picked up when feeling adventurous, and really loved. These are French folk songs, mostly acoustic guitar and bagpipes, though with some additional reeds at times. This highland/provincial France hybrid sound is great, and his voice and guitar playing are exemplary. While fairly clean and formal sounding, there's a real sophistication to the melodies - no dirty slacker vibe, nothing really even that Bohemian-sounding. It's just good guitar playing and great song construction. I've always meant to pick up other releases by him if I ever came across any, but I haven't. [3 November 2012]</p>

I weirdly like the mellow, tuneful side of Brian Ferry more than the fucked-up Eno-driven stuff, but this has a great balance ('Bitters End' closes it and it's like a doo-wop track gone mad). This is a cheap, thin repressing on Atco that sticks 'Virginia Plain' on there (which I don't think is on the original) but that's Ok cause it's a great song. [17 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">We join Waits, here, a few years after <i>Closing Time</i> but not quite at <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> yet. His voice has developed the gravely mania that he's known for, though it's not yet left the piano-driven jazz balladry. It's a nice midpoint, though; songs like ''Inivitation to the Blues' are successful, where the scat-croon 'Step Right Up' perhaps a bit less so. 'The Piano Has Been Drinking' is on here, a song that's he's never quite shaken off and seems to sum up this era of Waits in a nutshell, though it gets too bogged down in its repetition and easy humour for me. It's such an affect, but the songwriting has always delivered for me, especially on the later records like <i>Rain Dogs</i> which I don't actually have. I rarely, rarely am in the mood for this but when that time comes I know there's a boozy, smoky room conjured by this LP. [20 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I don't know whether to alphabetise this under Ustad, Ali, Akbar or Khan; I've always had it under U which is probably very wrong.  This is an LP with two Hindi ragas on it - 'Chandranadan' and 'Gauri Manjari'. Khan plays the sarod and is accompanied by tabla and tampura, so it's a classic raga sound.  I don't know anything about Indian classical music so it's hard for me to really review this.  The liner notes display the melodic themes for both ragas but the melodies don't set the mood so much as the way the three musicians interact.  There are long static parts where the tabla is insanely consistent and Khan is just picking a few notes every few seconds, leaving tons of heavy table-delineated space.  Both of them accelerate to the end, becoming a real jam, which is an effect both dramatic and mesmerising.  [28 May 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">A beautiful find, this record collects some Gagaku music, written around the year 900 but performed in 1979. Gagaku is pretty much the heaviest thing ever - slow, barely moving, yet gradually opening sounds built around reeds and spare percussion. This collection opens with 'Etenraku' which is supposedly the pinnacle of the form; there are some dance pieces after this which aren't any less intense. Though this is the slowest music imaginable, it's still incredibly fluid; a paradox between heavy and light that is somehow both, and has to be heard because I can't describe it with words.

<p class="p1">Royal Javanese gamelan music has its charms; perhaps it's not as smooth as the Balinese styles, but there's a heaviness  that really sticks with me after I listen. The first side of this is split into two pieces, and the second is a vocal one, where a male soloist sounds like he is eviscerating his soul. There is the most minimal musical accompaniment behind him at first, just a spare gong or drum, which really adds to the power. When the full ensemble comes in, it's a total life. Side two is a longer, courtly piece that is also lovely, and recorded in that distant yet genuine Ocora way. [29 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Freewheelin', ripping jazz from St. Louis that's recorded somewhat loosely, so you hear a lot of space and at times Mr. Thomas sounds like he's wandering down the hall with his horn. I don't really know any of these musicians but that's why it's on the Unheard Music Series, right? In college, these Unheard Music CDs were like manna from heaven - I remember getting excited about the release of each one. I'm not sure what happened to the series. Wish they were on vinyl. Anyway - Thomas makes a good case for himself as an overlooked genius; there's some really bluesy, gutbucket stuff, and when the two saxes interact it's occasionally genius. There's a swinging feel though - this is St. Louis, so the blues are felt - and there's the presence of "small instruments" by Abdullah Yakub which actually gives this a great tension between Art Ensemble-sorta stuff and more hard-bop/early free  feelings. The title track is a solo alto solo by Thomas and the last track is an alternate version, the requisite CD bonus track. [18 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">this is my favorite rock record of the year, so far. [2002] This was a pretty big favorite back in 2002 and I pulled it out today to hear how it has aged.  It still sounds good, maybe great even - and is a pretty good model for how to age gracefully (meaning songwriter Clint Conley, not the record itself).  A lot of people seemed to think that Chris Brokaw was the secret ingredient here, which is possible as this blows away any post-reformation Mission of Burma that I've heard.  It's interesting how about half of the lyrics were cowritten with a poet , and half are from Conley's own voice; there's a weird masculine/feminine duality going on, though the bitterness in tracks like 'Call It L---' is pretty harsh.  It sounds much more like R.E.M./80s college rock than I remembered, and some of the tracks have the potential to be classics ('That Boston Life').  I never could get into the second album yet I still have a promo CD that I've carried around with me and never listened to more than twice - maybe it's time again.

Side 1 is from a WFMU session and it takes a slow, slow build into 'Forest Gospel', the memorable bit of this side. It's no great observation to point out that a live album has a more raw sound than studio ones; caught just before the release of <i>Indian</i>, this is an Animal Collective who stay close to their guitar pedals, which the stark radio-station production indicates. The songs here haven't achieved the sublime elegance melodically that they hit around <i>Sung Tongs</i>; instead, it's more hyperactive, with whooping and screaming. Side two beings with crashing, thunderous drums and the structures are there, though most fo the surface feels collectively improvised, a sea of voices in exasperation. Nothing here ever ended up on <i>Indian</i> in a polished form as far as I can remember, though I should listen to that again. This was released on a Secretly Canadian offshoot label called St. Ives that turned unsold LP covers inside out and did limited runs; it's subsequently been reissued in the wake of Animal Collective's success, which even a few years after the face seems difficult for me to place into context. I knew these guys at the time and remember them telling me this was coming out; now it's a totally forgotten part of their discography. [23 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Eclipse</i> was recorded in the late 1970s by Hamza El Din, a Nubian musician who developed a unique style of oud playing by studying in Egypt (the oud is not commonly featured in Sudanese music). These five tracks are built around rolling, moody oud arpeggios and El Din's gentle yet raspy voice. The centerpiece is 'Your Love is Ever Young', a cover of an Um Kalthoum song, which extends over 18 minutes. El Din's songs expand so slowly that it's difficult to notice the movement from one section to another - a seemingly repetitive chordal patterns will shift into an entirely different one, as if the transitions are fluid and unseen. When they shift into major key harmonies, such as the end of 'The Visitors', these glimpses of Western intervals lend a familiarity to the proceedings. This is recorded in a warm, intimate room with fairly minimal production which is perfect for letting the overtones ring out. [24 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is considered one of the finest kora records ever, and I can hear why. It's built around two guitars, kora and balafon, and it's absolutely transcendent and beautiful. The four songs on here are all lengthy, but not too long, and are built around repetitive runs, all in a melodic key, that go on and on and allow lots of movement and lift. Jawara's vocals are free and extemporaneous, but backed up by a female vocal chorus. The kora is the main instrument, but it's really the balafon that rips off some beautiful runs and really sings. It was a decade ago that Rennie, a guy I barely knew from Pittsburgh, sent me a massive package of promo stuff from Rykodisc because he was working there as a lawyer. I would have never heard this if it wasn't for him throwing it into the package, probably randomly, and I'm incredibly thankful because I've listened to it lots over the past 10 years.

<p class="p1">I don't know why they didn't just call this <i>The Music of Egypt</i>, or maybe there's a central Egypt as well that isn't represented here. This is an old Mickey Hart recording from the late 70s of Egyptian music, which bears no resemblance to Westernised pop that likely occupies Egypt today, and it was recorded while the dead were on tour in '78. The first few tracks are built around looping percussion with lots of chanting - conveying the joyousness I usually find with African music, minus the heavy Islam stuff. But that kicks in with track 5, built around a thick drone on the mizmar, with jammy drums coming in and out at points. The longest track is the last one, 'Manami', which is built around tar, tambura and darabukka. The vocalist sings from a place balanced somewhere between casual and devoted, which is probably a good representation of Egypt, as least as I perceive it having never been there.

<p class="p1">These are legendary gamelan recordings made in 1941 by the Fahnestock brothers, which were exhibited in their time but never commercially released until this disc, which is part of the Library of Congress's endangered music project. The majority of this was recorded in Bali but some in Madura, and it's textbook examples of classic Balinese gamelan pieces, with the Kecak (monkey chant) thrown in as well, cause no Indonesia field recordings disc is complete without it. Given the age of the recordings they sound great and have the perfect atmosphere for field recordings -- the drum-based pieces specifically sound like true audiotourism, and there's a jaw's harp track that is insane.

<p class="p1">This is well over 3 hours of Balinese gamelan music, making this a hell of an afternoon. It's hard to talk about this critically as it's not something I feel any way to offer an artistic opinion. Disc 1 contains ten shorter tracks, showing off various Balinese approaches, with vocals, drumming and ringing tones. Disc two is built around a 54 minute version of the Ramayana monkey chant, which is almost clichéd except it's such a powerful, awesome thing to listen to. The third disc is built around three 20+ minute pieces, which get really insanely repetitive (in a good, deep way), particularly when the gamelan is just clanging along in the same pattern and the vocalists or flute are just going apeshit. There's lots of drama here, and that gamelan thing I love where the music hangs for a second happens throughout. These discs are likely all the Balinese gamelan I'd ever need, though I have a great LP too. [25 July 2012]</p>

I'm amused, enjoying quite a lot of this disc which is about as full-on 'crazy' as psychedelic music can be.  It loses just a tad bit though, by being so full-on.  There's a few actual beautiful moments but they're immediately juxtaposed against something else crazy; it sounds like a record of someone trying to be insane but without actually having anything to express artistically (which is my general criticism of VDO).  I hope this doesn't sound too harsh because there are some really great great parts here - it just doesn't rise to the level of something like Earth Trupet's <i>Roman</i> or the best Nurse With Wound work.

It's like fog lifting on a Scottish hillside, and it's truly beautiful through it's twisted, strange squeaking. The electric guitars in the third part are a raging storm though, and utterly magnificent. [20 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Area's first record begins with some Italian speech before 'Luglio, agosto, settembre (nero)' kicks in, which is one of the most familiar riffs in the Area canon. This is a hell of an impressive debut and an exemplary progressive rock record, though it doesn't have the fully-integrated progressiveness that their later material gets into. The quieter, more open bits are great but they feel really distanced from the "rock" parts which in turn feel very separate from the "jazz" parts. But this is a simple criticism - there's a swing throughout this, as they didn't abandon the pulse yet and they seem to be lockstep in a vision. [18 December 2012]</p>

Nothing from the Judy Dyble era, and no outtakes or rarities unless you count the 'Now Be Thankful' single. It's a pretty good collection I guess, and probably all the <i>Angel Delight</i>/<i>Babbacombe Lee</i> material I'd ever want.

<p class="p1">Some titans of the AACM assemble here for a concert that was released over two LPs, of which I only have the second. Leroy Jenkins has such a presence; his violins are everywhere but his crude harmonica playing is particularly notable. Muhal Richard Abrams dances all over the keyboard and the Richard Davis/Steve McCall rhythm section knows when to take control, as they do on side two. This is completely free and exploratory, and Braxton is here along with Leo Smith but they are sometimes just a presence. There's no real point where everyone goes apeshit; instead, they let things get very quiet, and when Davis starts bowing it's mesmerising. Braxton and Jenkins interact in a way that sometimes feels like a playful battle; like they are teasing each other, jabbing away until one capitulates. But neither do; it's as sophisticated as it is free. [24 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I don't have a lot of Derek Bailey records so I really value this one, which pairs him with Anthony Braxton for a long concert that was originally released as a double LP. This is only the second half but it explores so much territory that it's completely satisfying. The recording quality is fantastic - the microphones are really upclose and there's a perfect balance, so when Bailey is doing more delicate acoustic guitar things, Braxton's sax doesn't drown him out. Actually, Braxton plays quite a lot of flute here, which has a softer tone more suited against the sharp pluckyness of Bailey (who, honesty, sounds like he has about six hands here). A true meeting of the minds, perhaps, and thankfully it was well-documented. [29 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Area's live album is recorded in front of adoring fans; when they kick into the riff on 'Luglio, Agosto, Septembre' the crowd goes mad and the performance is basically like the album version only with different solos and a more raw, spontaneous feel. This is the least essential Area record I own but I couldn't pass it up at this price; it completes this era of their Cramps recordings and it's fun now and then, though I so rarely get the urge to listen to it. The long title track that starts the second side is the high point (well, apart from the amplified sounds of Stratos chewing and eating between songs on side 1), which builds slowly around a cathartic electric piano vamp and gets into a wide open jam. Good times, but I mostly stick with the studio albums as I like them more the more fucked up they get. [26 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a weird US pressing that actually is self-titled, but is really the second Fairport record (and first with Sandy Denny) -- but the sound is good enough so I can't complain. I don't think Fairport hit their stride til album #3, but you can hear them trying things out. 'Mr. Lacey' takes on an edgey blues-beat, and on a few tracks they sound like the Byrds. 'Fotheringay' and 'Meet on the Ledge' are the standout hits, but there's also a great version of 'She Moves Through the Fair'. Of all the covers of 'I'll Keep it WIth Mine' this isn't the best (I'll take Rainy Day's) but it's certainly passable, and this stuff is pretty much classic status now anyway. [25 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I have lots of love for the opening track of this Elton Dean excursion, a nine-piece band showcasing some of the finest of the London avant-jazz scene circa 1977. 'Nicrotto' is a restrained, glowing ball of exuberant sound. The brass sounds brassy, the piano relentlessly makes a cloud of soft tones, and the whole piece keeps billowing out like cloud. It reminds me a lot of the opening cut on the Scatter CD I released and the only real mar against <i>Happy Daze</i> is that the rest of the record doesn't hold a candle to it. Dean himself is not as obvious a presence as the twin trumpet/cornet attack of Marc Chatig and Harry Beckett; they have a beautiful interplay even though I'm not sure who is who. There's some great stuff on here though, and overall I appreciate anything with the Moholo/Miller rhythm section, and Keith Tippett is also a nice presence. [28 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Dave Burrell takes on Puccini here, in a swinging band with Grachan Moncur III, Beb Guerin, and Claude Delcloo. The free jazz-meets-opera sound works surprisingly well, as Puccini's piano melodies provide a series of quotes which they build around. Because of this structure, Burrell and Moncur are locked into the melodies primarily and it's the rhythm section that actually can fuck around a bit. Moncur plays a lot of flute here, which is quite improvisatory when Burrell is laying down the tune. Everyone gets their solos; Delcloo's is wide and sprawling, Burrell's tends to stay bluesy and melodic, and Moncur is just having fun. It's a true hybrid of a Western classical tradition with an American jazz one, and it's strikingly successful. [26 November 2012]</p>

I'm almost in danger of overplaying it; the tension and release between Haden's opening bass solo and the explosion of wet, echoing cornet is unlike anything else I've ever heard in music. It's pure sound porn. The whole album is great really - the title track is a new vision of music that's never really been explored, and the second half has some great crossover moments too, plus awesome vocal growing.

<p class="p1">Is Dando Shaft a great forgotten folk-rock band with psychedelic and jazz overtones? Or are they just another substandard Pentangle ripoff, lacking strong personalities and obscure for a reason? I think the truth is somewhere in-between. I've always enjoyed the Dando Shaft records I have quite a lot. The mandolin playing is spry, and the way the quick staccato notes are used to create painterly walls of sound is actually quite beautiful, a unique aspect of this band that doesn't really have any contemporaries. Though there's some weak lyrics - 'Cat Song' is a bit painful to get through, the sharp instrumentalism and gentle, naturalistic lyrics make this a very pleasant listen. [17 December 2012]</p>

The long jammy 'Stoned Frankenstein' suite on side 2 has some real moments, as would anything when you put a bunch of talented prog musicians together and get them baked out of their minds in 1970. Maybe a mid-afternoon listen was the wrong time for this; I didn't really lose my mind or anything, but I do very much enjoy this album usually. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Coming right after <i>Ear of Beholder</i>, this is a different beast entirely, though it contains elements of free, lively improvisation that are on <i>Ear</i>. This is Coxhill in his natural environment, leading a group of improvisers, in this case mostly Dutch musicians. It's a lot of fun though, with Van't Hof's piano carrying things with fairly straight 4/4 melodies. There's some chunky fusion parts, and the drumming varies between jazz and more abstract/rock/Beefheartian bits. Coxhill sounds true throughout, with his horn clearing a path of everything in its wake. There's a few super short interludes, more like experiments (1/3 of a second long) which emphasise the electicism. The whole session is recorded in a dusty, groggy room and everything sounds a bit underwater, which is a unique choice for 1972 but makes it sounds wooly, warm, and contemporary.

<p class="p1"><i>Ear of Beholder </i>is a curious album, and one that I feel really helped me in trying to figure out the relationships between improvisation, the artistic personality/ego, product, and presentation. This is a big claim to make about what might just seem like a goofy 2xLP of solo sax improvisations, piano-driven vocal pieces, and field recordings, but I couldn't think of a more accurate presentation of a person's ideas, personality and spirit than this. I've been struggling to bridge this in my own work, which I feel is mostly rooted in open-form exchanges, networks, and inter/trans-disciplinary collaborations. But then what does it mean when I make a record like <i>The 15,000 Day Boat Trip</i>? Or when I sit on stage and play the israj for 20 minutes? How do I bridge my own interests which are musical (which are far more than free improvisation, tape collage, whatever - but almost always geared towards media and the lovely horrible world of consumer-based music objects) with this desire to communicate across cultural lines? I don't think that Coxhill was necessarily motivated by this same urge, 40 years ago when <i>Ear of Beholder </i>was recorded, but I can clearly see that he is far more eclectic than the typical London free-improv dude, and wanted to release a grand statement to reflect that. Some may find this unfocused, or even silly at points, but I almost feel like I understand this man on a personal level because of this record. That he manages to weave some political/social content into a genre that is otherwise abstract and without real-life implications is all the more magnificent, and probably was a big influence on Cutler, Frith and the others doing this later in the decade. The playing, by the way, is great - there's all sorts of things on here, and every track is a delight.  - the man's technique was something special, and there's a few tracks recorded on a dictaphone in public places that have a rusty, creaky edge to them that makes them so much more enjoyable than what might have been recorded more 'cleanly' in a studio. And the honesty is just overwhelming - the spoken introduction, the simple drawings as artwork, and especially the humble "thank you" written on the back cover drawing -- it's as close as anything I've ever seen that can actually be a friendly, welcoming document of experimental jazz explorations. The other Coxhill records I have are also great but this is the one I truly cherish. [30 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is split between a quartet with some British musicians, and some duets with Veryan Weston or Michael Garrick. Lol does his soprano thing well here, in a really improvised jam on side A with the quintet - it gets rowdy near the end, with Ken Shaw's electric guitar kicking up some dust. Then on the flip it's the sax/piano duets, which are organised around 4 movements with Weston and 2 with Garrick. In the middle is a short solo piece, the title track, an exuberant bit of magic that's the most memorable cut here. But Coxhill is such a treasure, he brings something crafty even with these other obscure musicians who don't distinguish themselves much. [3 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The story behind this record, or at least behind why John Cale sounds so deranged and desperate on 'Heartbreak Hotel', is because he discovered just before the concert began that Kevin Ayers banged his wife. I'm not sure if that's true, but I love this version of 'Heartbreak Hotel' because of said vocal delivery - plus, the twisted female background singers, and the biting guitar. There's a whole lot more of Ayers than anything else - all of side 2 is really dedicated to his songs, but 's ok cause I like Ayers. Eno's contributions are 'Driving Me Backwards' and 'Baby's On Fire', the former being a great leadoff track - and his synths under Nico's 'The End' are awesome too. This feel like a bit of a cash grab for Island because as interesting as all of these artist were on June 1, 1974, this is no way essential. Also, Robert Wyatt has never contributed less to anything he's ever contributed to. [28 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The second Henry Cow record and I've always liked this one, maybe the most - it maintains a bleak edge, as the greyed-out sock indicates. But despite the minor key, there's a cohesive band pushing ahead with that distinctly British progressive rock sound, and I can't help but find it triumphant. 'Ruins' is one of the best, most epic Henry Cow songs. Lindsay Cooper's reeds add colour throughout, lending this a somewhat medieval British music feel at times, which ties together the history and content of the songwriting. Frith's compositions are moody, but sit well against the band's collective pieces. 'Linguaphonie' brings vocals into the mix, over a churning bassoon lick and exploratory Frith/Cutler stuff - a stunning track, which is playful and raucous while adhering to the dark mood. A bit more singing closes out the LP, I think it's John Greaves, and it's sort of elegiac. Rock in opposition, yes. [27 July 2012]</p>

I'm not against Jelly Roll Morton or Scott Joplin - and I'm all for history playing a role in contemporary music. It's just that what I like about Air is the interplay between these musicians and Threadgill's gestalt compositional style. There's a few nice solos here, but I can't help but see this as a move away from innovative composition and towards crowd-pleasing retro-fetishism. There's a Jelly Roll Morton tune on another one I have and that might be as much Air 'Lore' as I'll ever need. [17 December 2012]</p>

Stratros belts it out on side 1, but there's also parts where he's sputtering and babbling, like he's having a nervous breakdown.This all comes crashing to a halt on 'Caos', an aptly named track that is the last song on the last Area record I own (though <i>Event 76</i> came out later, it was recorded earlier); it feels like a fitting conclusion.

The Cow side is the best by far - it opens with unrestrained free improvisation before crashing into something more composed. The one-off band is pretty insufferable soul rock, but then Gong makes up for it on the D-side.It's a deep, jammy excursion, a call to arms for the psychedelic beast that was Planet Gong. There are some pretty, delicate guitar parts (kundali guitar and glissando guitar as credited, though you can never really understand what the hell Gong people are talking about).

<p class="p1">This is a great compilation of early United Dairies artists, which means it's a mix of strange sounds, mostly British in origin. The music is all experimental, but formed; song-based in some cases (Lemon Kittens, Truth Club) and also using tape loops and samples. The Nurse With Wound track is great, built around voices talking about aspiring; David Cross (who I think is the same one from King Crimson, not the standup comedian) has probably my favourite cut on the record, a multi-tracked mess of sharp cutting sound sources. Paul Hamilton and Joseph Duarte's 'Dance Music' is playful, like a Fred Frith improvisation mixed with echoey musique concrete - it's a beautiful track, occupying some space between early "industrial" music and free jazz.  The Whitehouse tracks are the low point for me, not because I dislike Whitehouse but because such harsh, abrasive sounds jar with the eclectic nature of the rest of the record.

<p class="p1">The <i>Mu</i> records are a beautiful bit of musical consciousness - a true communication between Cherry and Ed Blackwell. It's not about virtuoso freakouts here, though both are exemplary at their craft. This is about Cherry taking a major step forward in his transition from Blue Note recording artist/Ornette Coleman sideman to the the magical troubadour of indescribable earthpulse that he became. <i>Mu</i> is built around trumpet, piano and flutes, and it's a psychedelic experience that connects the human heart to the ground beneath. It's seeming formlessness echoes the motivations of the human mind. Jazz is a starting point - certainly there are some responsive back and forth moments, with Blackwell delicately responding to Cherry's whims, which are not out of place on any of the late 60's skronk classics. But this is a step forward - the dawning of a new age. [28 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The title of <i>Complete Communion</i> suggests a drone-like trance, something Buddhist or deeply spiritual perhaps -- or maybe it's just a communion of improvising musicians. This is part of Cherry's Blue Note trilogy, an important turning point before his more <i>out</i> explorations on <i>Mu</i>, <i>Blue Lake</i>, etc. It's built around open form post-bop jazz, with breaks for solos and melodic frameworks, but has not yet abandoned form completely. The band is shit-hot -- Gato Barbieri and Cherry come together for dual cornet/sax bursts that are really supportive of each other, yet extend the melodic explorations. Henry Grimes is the bassist and I've always considered him one of my favourites; with Ed Blackwell, it's a playful, spry combination. Side one is 'Complete Communion', broken into four movements, around a repeating theme with a slightly Spanish inflection ('Rememberance' at the end opens it up like a circus) which is possibly Barbieri's influence. Side two is 'Elephantasy', a bit more goodtimey, but with some beautiful Cherry trumpeting, especially at the end. [7 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I often say this is my favourite Amon Düül II record. It's more prog-based than the previous two, as the mesmerising opening cut, 'Syntelman's March of the Roaring Seventies' really blends together incredible rock riffage with good songwriting - and looks ahead to <i>Wolf City</i>. This is pressed in that old style where sides 1 and 4 are on the same platter, so I always forget and listen to the end in the middle, which is OK because the ending track, 'Toxicological Whispering' is too riff-rocking awesome to want to wait until the end. Some of this reminds me of the more guitar-based bits on <i>The Faust Tapes</i> but the <i>Yeti-</i>style is quite prevelant too - it's infectious without being poppy, and the singing is really tasteful and genuinely weird and scary. The entire side 3 is the epic jam to counterbalance the rock, and it's perfect. A landmark, for sure - but I like all four of the AD2 records I have so this is just a high water mark among a very high ocean anyway. [22 November 2012]</p>

Side one is a long Joseph Jarman piece that after the requisite quiet explorations, explodes into a rolling frolick, with some great Lester Bowie saturation. The B-side is a group composition, a tribute to Albert Ayler though it doesn't sound like Ayler at all. This is a staggering exploration - meaning it sounds like it's staggering around, never quite landing. There's an upcast exuberance for sure but it doesn't explode when you want it to. Vibes and reverberating bells give this an almost new-agey flavour at points. It's strangely feelgood and bluesy by the end, but only for a tease. [18 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">There's no shortage of places to hear Bert Jansch and John Renbourn together, but I think this is one of their earlier pairings. It's stripped down, purely guitars, with only a bit of singing by Jansch (one song on each side) and mostly originals, the exceptions being covers of Mingus's 'Goodbye Pork-pie Hat' and an Anne Brings tune. The playing feels a bit stiff, but not from a lack of comfort - almost like a deliberate tension, which renders the Mingus song curiously inelastic. Given Pentangle's love of jazz, and Mingus in particular, it's not a surprise, though I wished the drummer from Pentangle was there to make it more snappy. Side one's 'Soho' is a great tune that sounds like something from Jansch's solo work, and the record feels like an important step in the developmentt of their partnership, if not completely essential.

The fast runs of notes are very much in the vein of rock music, even on tracks that get a bit more exploratory. Lots of jamming, yeah, and Stratos's voice is typically astounding. There's a proper political folk/rock song in the middle of it all,which centers things a bit from the incessant riffing. Only the last track gets truly weird, but it feels like a tossed off spazzfest. <i>Crac!</i> is overall solid, though I like Area's more free styles the most, which are least apparent here.

There is no resemblance to the explosive arena-prog on their regular Cramps releases. Even <i>Maledetti</i>, their most experimental and dadaist release, sounds tame compared to this. This is akin to the Futura records sound of the time, with moments that recall Jac Berrocal's explorations - all through a spooky, reverb-laden room which enhances Lacy's inhuman sax runs and Stratos's disembodied weirdness. Totally amazing, but not really what I want when listening to Area; maybe it's something better. [29 October 2012]</p>

It must be quite conceptual - the cover has a Mandrill bending over to show its coloured ass, which is the title of the first track. It's built around McCall's drumming, very solid, and the record opens with a very flat rhythm over which Threadgill sniffs out some tune-constructing. He switches to flute on the b-side for the sneaky sounding 'Card Cutten', where Threadgill and Hopkins seem to be engaged in a tug of war. It never gets aggressive; like most Chicago-school dudes, there's a focus that lends all of their music an impressive vitality. [23 August 2012]</p>

The major difference is that while <i>Trout Mask</i> and <i>Decals</i> sound like music from another world, on this album (and <i>Clear Spot</i>) it sounds like music made by really strange humans.

<p class="p3">I used to regard this as the high point of this style of 70's British prog rock.  The band is tight, first-rate musicians and the compositions are very much of the genre yet possessing something extra - an admirable quality of experimentation within the confines of crunch guitar riffs and neoclassical noodling.  Of course I'm biased cause I love Chaz Hayward and he's bashing away and singing on the wonderful last song 'Rongwrong', a proto-Heat track not just because of his piercing vocals but also Bill MacCormick's long bass solo over Dave Jarrett's resounding electric piano chords - it's exploratory and surreal and beautiful.  Listening for the first time in a few years, I find this slightly more generic than I remembered, though it's still a fantastic album, and far more than the forgettable Roxy Music side-project it was probably dismissed as during its time.  There's some Crimsony parts, other jams that sound like Hatfield and the North - actually I'm not usually fond of the electric piano but there are some lovely shimmering moments at the end of side 1.  But still, it all comes back to 'Rongwrong' - the playful singsong quality is actually great, shades of  'Moon in June' as Hayward talks about how to 'levitate my soul in six easy lessons' and 'stay home and listen to Schoenberg in the bath'.  Ah, pre-punk 70's - things never sounded more precise than here.  [6 Feb 2009]</p>

The second side is where she blasts through the title track, the Doors cover which is an extremely unsettling listening experience. But the real highlight for me is the closer, the strange, patriotic song for Germany, sung in full Teutonic ardour over thick, overlapping organ. It's like Charlemagne Palestine gone Nazi, and therefore laden with the history/baggage of postwar German identity. I can't understand the lyrics, nor do I really want to, so maybe I'm reading into this a lot, but knowing about the explosion of unrest among mid-70s German youth, I can't help but make the association and feel a curious power.

McCall and Hopkins open that up with a long, rhytmic piece that's a solo for both at times, but very restrained, focusing on the pulse. Threadgill sounds great, at always; his smooth yet piercing tone dominates the first side and even when he hangs back, his presence is felt. But that's why Air was a great group - the three had a perfect balance, a dynamic that keeps the others in check and proves to be interesting even on that record I have of jazz standards.

The photo on the back shows them both wearing monk-like robes, which makes me perceive this entire recording as a weird contemporary classical renaissance faire thing. There's also zither and melodica here, making the title mostly inaccurate. The two pianos have a strong interplay and I actually really enjoy this record, which has jazz-like runs and blues impressions yet stays in orbit around a centre. The slower parts feel very improvisatory, and it's hard to think they aren't at least somewhat - composing this type of fluidity would be impossible. But then they stop on a dime and go into some crazy counterpoint. I'm not sure which is which, in terms of musician, but there's a unity here that suggests a deeper musical relationship between these two than just being interpreters of a Braxton score.

<p class="p1">I have so many Braxton records but that's because each of them has something rewarding. This is a bright, boomy mid-70's band with some solid musicians performing these unpronounceable compositions. Dave Holland, who I am always a fan of, as well as Jerome Cooper, Kenny Wheeler, and some (for the time, emerging) NYC guys on the B-side - Hemphill, Bluiett, and Oliver Lake. But the most distinctive track is the jam between Braxton and MEV's Richard Teitelbaum, a meeting of clarinet and synth which is furtive and daring, a real diversion into outer space.

This original Harvest pressing is somewhat battered (and my frequent listens haven't helped), plus the side 1 label is on both sides (but the previous owner, maybe Ross, wrote "side one" in ink). Ayers had a shit-hot band here that featured Lol Coxhill and Mike Oldfield, and this gives it the right balance between prog-rock and outer limits explorations. The songs are also balanced between some of his most tuneful pop jams ("May I", "The Oyster and the Flying Fish") and some absolutely fucked up monster jams. The title track closes it out and it's just stunning; though this pressing lacks the dynamics the CD used to (there, I said it for once) I'm still glad to have it. [29 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This Braxton release from his Arista area is quite boucy, and begins with a cover version of a Maceo Herb Brown song -- not something to expect from Braxton, but he keeps the post-bop approach throughout, even when the band comes in. The closing track (unfortunately impossible to render even in UTF-8, like most of his titles) is a stomper - energetic (which I don't often think of Braxton as being), yet still brainy, and with a great group interplay dynamic.

<p class="p1">Braxton's really got the orchestra cooking here - this explodes with a really sweet, soulful tune where various soloists take lead for just a line or two before the group crashes in, all over a swinging beat that seems to stave off the nervous, almost apocalyptic feeling caused by this much energy. This lively, big-band feel keeps up across side 1 - the last track (of course a pictorial title I can't write) isn't a million miles off a John Phillip Sousa jam. The second side begins with a left-field, classically somber Braxton exploration - slow, opening, and with plucking, exploratory piano and tentative, droning brass. The rest of the LP plays out in a similar vibe - slow, sneaky, and careful, but nonetheless expressive, as the increased use of space lets the vibrato really ring out. It's a good portrayal of Braxton at this point, having a little something for every mood. [1 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a somewhat forgotten record of Michael Mantler writing music to Edward Gorey lyrics, with a great delivery by Robert Wyatt. The songs are in that progressive rock/jazz hybrid, though since there aren't any brass instruments here, it comes off as much more rock. The band is made from the usual Watt crew, with a rhythm section of  Steve Swallow and Jack deJohnette, and then Terje Rypdal doing searing guitar lines throughout while Carla Bley plays intense, driving piano throughout. I don't think Mantler himself actually plays at all here - at least not trumpet - and he's not credited as a musician - so I guess this is a compositional project. The record is lots of fun thanks to Wyatt's presence, which puts everything in that familiar tone, plus his whimsicality suits the dark fun of Gorey's lyrics. There's only six songs so this is more like a mini-LP, but it's a great time thanks to the band getting pretty loose. Henry Cow is actually probably the closest comparison musically, except there's not as much exploration. [8 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I always treated this like gold, thinking it was an original pressing, but the always trusty discogs.com suggests it's actually a 1972 repress. That's no reason not to love it -- this is a fantastic debut, a masterpiece of improvised music (though I know, I know, it's 'composed') that ranks against the best late 60's AACM sides, maybe the very best. Little instruments, piano, horns, and eveything you'd expect is there -- there's a range of dynamics that was probably unlike anything anyone outside of Chicago was doing. If I have one complaint it's that this doesn't feel particularly 'Braxton' - like he hadn't yet found his compositional voice, and the distinctly cerebral edge that defines his vision. Don't tell anyone, but I'm not complaining. [25 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">The best kind of live solo piano records are the ones where you can really hear the night - the audience, the room, and the air are if not audible at least a <i>presence</i> on the record.  I don't know how many live solo piano records I've actually heard; I guess I'm just basing this on some Cecil Taylor ones.  Poor Richard Abrams has probably always lived a bit in Taylor's shadow (as all free pianists probably do) though his style is probably a lot closer to McCoy Tyner during the classic Coltrane work.  These three "songs" (as they are titled) reveal three different sides of Abrams.  The first, 'D Song', is made up primarily of single notes runs played rapidly.  'String Song' is a total departure - it's Abrams playing the inside of the piano, banging on some percussion and ringing a few gongs.  It's a nice change of pace but it feels a little bit unfocused.  'Voice Song', the 20 minute track that is the entire side 2, is a more general piano workout.  There are busy fast moments and delicate bits, as well as some rumbling softer parts, and while it certainly demonstrates his talents as a piano improviser I'm sometimes left a bit cold in knowing what it actually expresses.  If music is a spiritual force for Abrams (as the liner notes indicate) then that's fine enough, but listening to a live experience 30 years later I can't say that I completely connect with it.  [16 April 2009]</p>

This LP sounds the way it should - those free form freak-outs scream out of the vinyl and I swear you can hear all 50 weirdos plucking about with their glass bottles and cardboard boxes. I tend to forget about this one in favour of <i>God Bless...</i> but there's some great, fucked up songs here - 'Transparent Radiation', and the genius 'Former Reflections Enduring Doubt' to name but two. Mayo is just beginning to figure himself out, but his voice has all the honesty you could ever want, and despite the freak-outs and the reverb and all the other things people did in 1967, they sound like the gang of outsider nutjobs they were (instead of another jammy drug band). The freak-outs are integrated pretty well, and this actually pre-dates the Nihilist Spasm Band's first record, which is remarkable because there's a real affinity of sound. 'Parable of Arable Land', the song, is a great piece of minimalist work that accidentally presages decades of out-sound fuckery for years to come. This doesn't quite usurp <i>Easter Everywhere</i> as the best International Artists/Texas psych record, but it's surely a contender (along with Bubblepuppy!).  [16 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Can's masterpiece, arguably, but it's a good argument. The most exploratory tracks ('Peking O', 'Aumgn') are, simply put, some of the most incendiary and challenging experimental music ever put to tape. It's balanced with some more song and riff-based tunes, like the immortal 'Halleluwah'. As long and sprawling as this is, it's basically perfection. My copy isn't the classic cover but a weird British pressing in a matchbox-style sleeve, lovely in its own right, but due to rip eventually. After forty years it's still holding up but I get nervous every time I play this, which is often. [3 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I file this under 'H' for Hobbs because he's the constant over both sides, though it's hard to figure out what to do when Eno is releasing records this disjointed. 'Aran' begins is, which is Hobbs and Bryars together on reed organ and some toy instruments, with lots of overdubs. It reminds me of Moondog or Lou Harrison, but with a more somber, contemplative edge due to the constant presence of the organ. John Adams has a piece for a larger ensemble, split into three movements. 'John Philip Sousa' is a slowly accelerating bit of repetition that fails to achieve the playfulness that the Residents managed with their Sousa tribute. 'Christian Zeal and Activity' is a beautiful piece of orchestra minimalism that becomes overtaken by a recording from religious talk radio; shades of GYBE!'s 'BBF3' or Sun City Girls' 'Napoleon and Josephine', but years before either. 'Sentimentals' is a pretty melodic piece based around Duke Ellington's 'Sophisticated Lady'. On the B-side we get more Hobbs/Bryars organ minimalism, and then a very experimental Bryars piece called '1,2,1-2-3-4' which again I must compare to the Residents, or that Legion of RockStars YouTube band. The liner notes explain how various musicians (including Derek Bailey, Cornelius Cardew, and Andy MacKay) play along while wearing isolating headphones. The effect is druggy, disorientating, and somewhat chilling, and I rather like it. [29 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Late 70's Hugh Hopper lacks the outness of <i>1984</i> but has a really heavy organ part in the middle of side 1 that sounds like Castlevania with a fuzz bass behind it. It's a studio affair, with Hopper and a rotating cast of sidemen that includes Elton Dean, Dave Stewart and Nigel Morris. The usual British prog stuff is here, but side two features a cover of Ornette Coleman's 'Lovely Woman' that goes for delicacy and tenderness, a wise move. Some of the slower thick bass guitar licks remind me of all those Pittsburgh-style bands that would just riff over a drummer, only slowed down here and with all the aggression removed. The final cut is Hopper solo, a moody meandering melody that is probably the most charming track on here. [24 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Kevin Ayers' first album is generally regarded as his best but I find it lacks the musical freakout madness of <i>Shooting at the Moon</i>, and the songwriting, while stellar, lacks the melancholy magic of <i>Whatevershebringswesing</i>. But I'm nitpicking - this is a much-deserved psychedelic classic, based around Ayers' genial personality, which just soaks these songs with a good-time feel. Even the minor key intensities in tunes like 'Lady Rachael' end up resolving in a singsong chorus; the darker psych tinges of tracks like 'Stop This Train' are offset by a songwriting style based somewhat in English music hall traditions -- and a fairytale vibe. Soft Machine is the backing band on 'Song for Insane Times' but the song is anything but insane - it's more like Tony Clifton-style lounge cabaret commentary. Ayers plays most of the instruments here but on the next album he forms The Whole World, and that's where things really take off. [18 August 2012]</p>

The more orchestrated English-sounding stuff is good, but when he stays true to writing rock/folk songs with a simple backing band, it's even better. The guitar solos are relatively restrained cause this is an album for his songwriting to shine, and his vocals are strong as well. There's still a bit of joyousness here, even on songs like 'The Angels Took My Racehorse Away', especially compared to the misery that would follow on his work with Linda Thompson, still Linda Peters on this album. Nice playing by Barry Dransfield on fiddle, Sandy Denny on piano (!) and a horn section that underplays, which is what's perfect for this feel. [25 September 2012]</p>

It's a mix of a-capella and instrument-backed songs, with the usual gang of Brit-folk luminaries (Martin Carthy, Nic Jones, Danny Thompson). The arrangements are sometimes casual (June's 'Geordie', which just has Carthy strumming behind, is splendid) and sometimes more ornate ('Doffin' Mistress' gets quite <i>Defender of the Crown</i> in places). The solo duets - 'Burning of Auchidoon', 'My Husband's Got No Courage in Him', 'Four Loom Weaver' - are spellbinding. The production is crisp but not overdone, letting the voices ring out.

<p class="p1">I don't know what to say about <i>Attahk</i> - in some ways, it reminds me of an Area record, with the over the top operatic vocals in a language I can't understand, except it's an invented language instead of Italian. But the jazzy cadences are there, and the impressive drumming, guitar playing and song structures - and my distance from both of those records are equal, except maybe I like Area a bit more because it feels more political and adventurous. 'Maahnt' has a somewhat 'Third Uncle' vibe, with an edge bassline and the vocals being yelped, felt but not really heard. No disrepect to Magma, who I am a casual fan of, but <i>Attahk</i> feels more adult contemporary at points than I'd like it to, such as the last part of side 1 which has these female vocals in a pseudo-opratic style around a sensitive piano melody, and the Zeuhl thing is something I've never totally bought into, so I can only assess it one Earthly tones. As much as I love that Magma exists, I don't click with them on a 100% level and I think I like the other two records better. [21 August 2012]</p>

The sound is much more akin to the soft-rock sounds of Fleetwood Mac than the Fairport style, though Richard gets feudal on 'The Choice Wife'. The Linda-sung songs are lovely but I prefer Richard's voice, on songs like 'House of Cards'. The production and arrangements are so somber, even when the songs are upbeat, that there's no guitar shredding; I want another song as heavy as 'Calvary Cross' anywhere in his discography, but I don't think it exists.

There's also tracks from Limbus, Annexus Quam, Witthüser &amp; Westrupp, Embryo, Floh de Cologne, Tangerine Dream and Guru Guru, and the long format allows these artists to spread out a bit, which is exactly what you want from this type of music. This is presented as new "pop music" but the screeching reeds and strings of Limbus, or the dense drone of Tangerine Dream show that this is anything but popular. Witthüser &amp; Westrupp share the last side with Floh de Cologne, and it adds a songy, operatic vibe to things.

Though the liner notes draw attention to this, the rest of the packaging doesn't make a big deal out of it, though Pauline Oliveros included a photo of an old man with a moustache for hers. Her track, by the way, is nuts - built around a sample of an opera recording, with wild synthesizer screams over it. Megan Roberts has the most tribal-sounding and least electronic piece on here, built around chanting and drums. It sounds more like <i>Invasion of the Thunderbolt Pagoda</i> or the Cro-Magnon record, and feels a bit odd between Laurie Spiegel and Ruth Anderson's minimalist synth. Annea Lockwood contributes probably my favourite work on the record, a static, ghost-like piece that is sadly too short. And finally, Laurie Anderson doing what she does - a spoken word narrative piece over sharp, buzzing electronics, also clashing with the rest of the album, but pretty fun anyway.

It's so incredibly human - and when the horns come in to accentuate these melodic experiments it feels accidental, almost like something the band is trying out, without committing.

<p class="p1">Acid Moms dropped a lot of releases around this time and I usually cite <i>La Novia</i> as the high point, but it's hard to argue with this, which packs so much Acid Mothers Temple into two discs that it touches on almost everything they do. The opening cut is a long, dense blast of repetition and it's amazing on its own; that it's followed with 1 and 3/4 more discs of hot psych jams is just icing on the cake. There's ferocious guitar hellstorms, busted up improvisations, and spacey excursions; disc two starts with what sounds like Steve Reich-influenced trance-minimalism. By the end my brain has fallen out of my head, which is exactly the point. I stopped listening to this band for about 8 years so its actually quite rewarding to go back and let this massive psychedelia wash over me. [30 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Pentangle's first album is a loose, fun jam that begins with some dark bowed upright bass before laying down the foundation that was their sound: jazzy acoustic rhythm section, virtuouso folk guitarists, and the flute-like voice of Jacqui McShee floating over all. When Jansch harmonises with her, its beautiful, but the long instrumental passages contain some brilliant work. The longest track, 'Pentangling' is I guess their anthem, and it's a warm sketch with a coy complexion, leaving a nice bit of space between the sounds. I listen to this one the least but it's strong all the way through. [15 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The joke-that's-not-really-a-joke, Richard Youngs and Andrew 'Paz' Paine made this album in the late 90s which was highly influenced by progressive rock's biggest excesses. There's spoken bits about fairies and demons (or something, I stopped listening) and lots of atmospheric misty sunlight-across-the-dew moments, and of course thunderous, monsterous riffs ('LABYRINTH' is ripping) and organ solos. It's not really meant to be funny, but rather to genuinely pay tribute to this influence. Of course it's a long way from Yes or Gentle Giant - the lack of drums being a big one, but instead of rooting this in a folk form, they try anyway for the prog pyrotechnics, and largely succeed. I never really listened to the second Ilk record but this is enough, especially as it clocks in at 70 minutes (of course!). I hope I sound positive because I do love this - the mood is perfect, the arrangements adventurous, and 'Of Departure' ranks among the best and most beautiful song-fragments of Richard's entire career.

<p class="p1">Well, of the 1,701 music entries I've made here over the past decade, I've written something in the 'comment' box for 852 of them, slightly more than half. But my ultimate goal is to have a review/comment on every entry (which I've been very good about with films and books that I finished reading). So I use the 'suggest unreviewed' feature I put in (check the top of your music page) to randomly suggest I listen to things. This Double Leopards LP came up and it's a nice thing to revisit almost a decade later. When I ordered this, I just heard it was good; in subsequent years I met all the band members and actually became really good friends with Mike Bernstein for awhile, talking to him daily for a year or two though we've fallen out of regular correspondance. I don't know if this was the first Double Leopards LP or one of the first, but it sounds almost innocent and young, despite how confident it is. And furthermore it's a blueprint of what everyone was doing when I was most actively involved with UK experimental music. This is heavily psychedelic despite a limited palette; only the track 'garements in the midst of my vestures' really gets wild with synths and other spacey sounds (but also with lots of space). This is music that breathes through it's ebbs and flows, built I think around (mostly) processed voices. The deep drones begin and end in an intertwining fashion and despite the darkness, it's incredibly warm and inviting. Liner notes list three members, with impossible to deciper names and also guitar/bass/drums credited; I think this was before Maya joined? Or maybe before Chris did; not completely sure either way.

<p class="p1"><i>Moon</i> is a pretty furious ball of sound, with an Italian band of nobodies (not meant in a derogatory way, but i never heard of any) and some good trombone to cut against the squealing of his straight horn. The album blows by quickly, and never really stops long enough to be memorable except that one song with the vocals. It's from that Globe Unity school of European explosiveness, though the recording quality makes it sound small despite the aggression. I like <i>Moon</i> but it's so dense that it's hard to really unravel it. Lacy is a quite uncompromising artist and though this doesn't stick in my memory like <i>The Forest and the Zoo</i>, it's still a remarkable document about what was happening in Rome in '69.

<p class="p1">Cost: $0</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Orient</i> is a great lost Don Cherry record, and when it was reissued a decade ago, the skies sang with a chorus of angels. 'Orient' and 'Eagle Eye' are the centerpieces, both split over two sides. The title track begins with Cherry on piano, and turns into a drum freakout by Han Bennink, with Cherry vocalising. On the flipside we get more piano, which is played in a slow, circular melodic way, not at all a jazz style. There's a tambura player on this track who inhabits the distance but doesn't dominate; it lets the dark modality breath and Bennink can do his thing. On 'Eagle Eye', the piano shifts to a syncopated, slow melody with Cherry moaning (mostly) wordlessly over top. Okay Tamiz is the drummer now and he's far more groove-orientated than Bennink, turning this into something trance-like (and with frequent calls to the audience to help). Things get more Eastern on the last tracks - 'Si Ta Ra Ma' is an endless chant with light bongo-style percussion that becomes taken over by a piano riff which is almost like a pop music hook. Overall this has very little of Cherry playing what he is known for, yet it somehow feels like one of this most representative works. [25 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've never completely understood how this one is banded - both sides list two compositions, 'Reese' and 'The Smooth Ones', composed by Mitchell and Bowie respectively, but without a band or a clear distinction between the tracks - suggesting that we are listening to two simultaneous compositions, which is very possible. There are exuberant, brassy trumpet parts on side two suggesting this is Bowie at work - not just because the trumpet is present, but because the melodies are so bold, at times recalling Iberian folk music or at least bullfighter images for me. The percussion is full-on, with this being recorded in that amazing fertile Studio Saravah period where the stars all aligned. Pre-Don Moye Art Ensemble is wonderful in its own way and this ranks as one of the most exploratory and rambunctious (there's a part where Jarman and Mitchell just blow against each other as hard as they can, an unusually aggressive act for them).

<p class="p1"><i>Invisible Map</i> finds Biota doing what they do - creating acid-soaked song experiments that are buried in electo-acoustic processing. At 38 tracks in 76 minutes, it's pretty full-on, but good times throughout. The endless sea of reverb around the lead vocalist and the chaos created by the acoustic guitars and accordions makes this start to sound the same after awhile, especially with all the affected percussion tracks. Since I have a few other CDs by them, it's really hard to distinguish between different albums. The songwriting uses weird modal patterns that give it a folky/European tilt (not to mention the instrumentation - anything that uses a squeezebox this prominently makes me think of street musicians from a French arthouse film), and this songwriting grounds it, though also keeps it from being as obvious and contemporary sounding as, say, Animal Collective, who employ similar production techniques but sound like a completely different beast.

<p class="p1">Roy Wood's solo music is no less eccentric than his work with the Move (or Wizzard, come to think of it); this first record is a wonderful song cycle in which Wood plays every instrument and does all vocals (even the ones that sound like female background singers). There's some weird genre excursions that show his interest in Wizzard, but otherwise it's consistent. The best track is a weird 3/4 number that reminds me a lot of Eno's "Put a Straw Under Baby". Another recommended rock oddity. [1/3/2004]</p>

<p class="p1">The first Biota CD that I'm familiar with, this is 70 minutes of exploding songforms, all based around a collective of musicians in Arizona or somewhere in the American southwest - yet I always feel there's a strong European flavour to this music. That's maybe due to the high presence of accordion and the ethereal female vocals that glide overtop. I tend to enjoy Biota, these days, when they are more straight-ahead. Some of these tunes, like 'Private Wire', sound like classic 80s 4AD stuff except with heavy processing. The impulse to put every instrument through some sort of effect is quite hard for Biota to overcome, and what originally drew me to their music; it reminds me a bit of Animal Collective with very different instrumental and songwriting influences. But like Animal Collective, trusting in the melody and occasionally going for something more 'dry' leads to higher dividends. [18 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Bugskull made some pretty weird records in the mid-90s, but who was listening? This is a turning point between the guitar-driven psychedelic pop of <i>Phantasies and Senseitions</i>-era Bugskull and the downtempo electronica of the later stuff. There's still waves of psychedelic guitars over the mellow, spacious jams; A.R. Kane is actually an interesting comparison, though maybe not an obvious one. The singing is pushed low but there's still some catchy songs. 'Exit Wound' is a Morricone-style meditation that closes out the album nicely; the title track is probably the most memorable cut. This feels a lot less like a soundtrack than other Bugskull albums, and maybe is the sound I like the most from him. [2 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">When your records are in storage for 3+ years, you tend to forget that some even exist.  When re-alphabetizing I came across this and had absolutely no memory of it, though according to the infallible database I not only bought this 6 years ago, but I even bothered to mail-order it from Canada (likely the only place to get it at the time).  This late period Bügsküll (could he still be making music today? I have no idea!) is collaborating with the Big White Cloud (I guess), and moves pretty far away from the early song-based stuff but also moves away from the more dancey material of <i>Snakland</i> and the <i>Distracted Snowflakes</i>.  There is some vocalising, though it's more of a spoken word style.  This album is still constructed like those other ones though - mostly instrumental, with cheap synths and strangely melodic, rhythmic pieces that are kinda quirky, fruity, silly even.  There are some weird, dark moments with bending melodies, squaking reverb-drenched saxophones, and a curious unending feeling - it actually reminds me a bit of LAFMS stuff, like Smegma, though with a slightly pastel sheen.  I'm sure this was all home-recorded and it's an approach to psychedelia that's relatively free from obvious precedents (besides the aforementioned LAFMS, which is probably just to my ears) - it's pleasing, enjoyable, maybe even great at times, but not earth-shattering in any way.

I knew Jack a bit and last saw him play in Glasgow when touring on this type of material (it was after <i>Opium Musick</i> had come out). The Fahey debt is enormous, to the point of almost leaving me little else to say about it. Listening now, I'm struck by how full and intimate the recording is - the second side's scrapes and other byproducts are up-front, almost like as a listener I'm inside the soundhole of the guitar. The structures are clear but the details are semi-improvised - it's all an expression of beauty, even when rolling into its own tension and release. I don't know if I prefer this or the one after it (and I don't even know how many more he put out) but it's definitely a wonderful thing to have on warm, wooly vinyl. [3 October 2012]</p>

The first half of this is an electric guitar blues, 'No Deposit No Return', and I think I used to just fear the 12-bar. But this is a beautiful, open, and fragile blues, with the entire instrumentation played by Bull himself. The b-side, 'Electric Blend' is an even more loose raga, incorporating more eastern percussion. It's soft, yet biting, and displays the mastery of a true musical wizard who doesn't need to show off any fretboard histrionics - the beauty is between the notes here. [5 November 2012]</p>

For both of us, really. The mastering is actually quite low, so it sounds a bit thin, which is a shame - but since the source recordings are homemade, maybe this is appropriate. It's small music that is intensely personal, melodic and charming. Daniel's the least interested in progressive rock of any member of VtB - and maybe the most musically traditional as well - and this is reflected here. The clarinets and keyboards give it a nice British folkyness, but there's no darkness on display. It's a really nice, somewhat quirky musical vision. [31 December 2012]</p>

Of which this LP is the absolute masterpiece. A large ensemble South African big band playing straighahead, catchy music that still has room for freakouts and hooks = right up my alley. This is one of my favorite jazz records ever, and their only real great statement (the live albums and bootlegs of the band are sort of terrible).

Debris brilliantly straggled the line between Beefheartian avant-rock and Pere Ubu-esque noise breakdowns. There are saxophone solos, discordant guitars, and a nihilistic proto-no wave edge. The booklet goes through the story of the band and all of the songs; clearly they influenced nobody, as this was heard by nobody (and probably not even after the reissue) but it's great if you like this sort of thing, which I obviously do. This doesn't have a song that is truly transcendent (except for maybe 'New Smooth Lunch') making this a bit more historical curiosity than personal inspiration, but the vocal effects, sexual obsessions, and general chaos makes this enjoyable through all 76 minutes.

This CD is much more 'wet' but offers riches in listening, though there are points where it's so quiet that my old, noisy CD player is more audible than the delicate electro-acoustic percussion improvisation these two geniuses lay down here. I like small, quiet sounds, but the title is accurate as this is completely fluid music, always moving and evolving. It's not quiet all the way through - it flares up into wild, active interplay (track #6 in particular) where the percussion is often identifiably percussion, etc. [26 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A reissue of Heeman and Khan's classic LP from 1987, packed with bonus tracks galore. <i>Im Schatten der Möhre </i>is a wild trip that throws everything into the blender, happy to employ collage techniques both surrealist and dada, with a strong focus on unsettling, psychedelic environments. This experimentation, while often humorous (I mean, look at the cover!) is never cynical; when smooth strings and female vocals appear on, say on the epic 'Bobbejaanland', it's a further exploration of genre deconstruction, not a mockery. The debt to Throbbing Gristle is apparent, mostly through the variety. The almost-title track 'Im Lande Der Möhre' is a  small masterpiece of minimal drift, and this is a beautiful thing, yet somehow feels casual. The bonus tracks I've never really made it through but I think the album is satisfying enough, so maybe they should be listened to as a standalone listen, not after. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">There is something more innocent about early Richard Youngs - like he didn't have quite as much confidence, though he still seems to know exactly what he wants to do. Does that make any sense? This record, based around acoustic guitar, voice, and kazoo, is among my favorite of his "song" records. The intimacy is genuine, but the music is strange (yet simple). A good starting point, I think. [10 Nov 2005]</p>

Of course, none of the Glasgow bands can write songs as good as 'Warrior in Woolworths'. So many of these British bands at the time had saxophones, which is kinda weird, cause they don't sound anything like Huey Lewis and the News.

Some of the songs are just beautiful, perfect pop songs, like a hobo Brian Wilson. But other moments are so inconsistent that you realize why R. Stevie Moore is such a miserable disappointment.

<p class="p1">Whenever I listen to these Cecil Taylor solo piano albums I love the way the piano sounds - so the recording quality has a big effect on how I listen to it. This is a pretty good record as it featured 9 songs, all at palatable lengths and with very distinct moods ('The Stele Stolen and Broken Is Reclaimed' is exuberant and wild; 'Astar's playful and sneaky; 'Corn IN Sun + T (Moon)' is somewhat more reflective). The piano used here, noted as being a Bösendorfer Grand Piano Imperial, is recorded with a lot of low mid-rangey sounds. I love the way the upper register of the fingerboard tends to sound on Taylor solo LPs, but here the higher frequencies seem to roll off, sounding at times almost like a well-synthesised MIDI keyboard (though not quite that digital). Good, and diverse enough to be a good representation of Taylor's work, but somehow just not my favourite release of his. [30 July 2012]</p>

A live recording from '73, there's a nice sense of atmosphere - a roomy feel, the crowd almost audible holding their breath at Cecil's runs layer and overlap.

<p class="p1">This double LP is Cecil Taylor at his most transgressive, in that band he had around the period, with Jimmy Lyons (such a great, great player), Alan Silva, and a violinist by the name of Ramsey Ameen. Ameen brings a high-octane kick to the band, which works perfectly with Taylor's own playing; the percussive nature of the piano works great against the screeching assonance of the violin - side three is particularly manic. This is truly relentless - it never stops across four sides - and it might be my favourite Cecil Taylor record of the many I own. [24 August 2012]</p>

Without any bass, the low end is occupied mostly by Taylor and I guess Ware; it makes everything feel lighter,and you can distinguish the interplay between the pianos and saxes more clearly.

It's easy to ignore the story though, and listen instead to the strange proto-industrial rhythms, accentuated by the usual Residents synth gurgles, broken bursts of melody, and dying kazoo sounds. Maybe the whole thing can be taken as a giant political allegory -- I've never been completely sure, not have I really invested myself enough. There's way more vocals than <i>Eskimo</i>, but thankfully this is before they get into their mid-80s period, where the quality really drops off (though I appreciate their efforts in charging forward).

<p class="p1">This is a lovely recording of a transitional time for Taylor and for Shepp. This is built out of the older lineup with Buell Neidlinger, but with Shepp as guest. He hangs back actually and really only accents a few tracks. This was recorded in 1960 but reissued a bit later; there's a few extremely tender runs for Taylor, particularly at the end of 'This Nearly Was Mine', that shows a genius able to merge tradition with his other abstractions. The second side has two extended pieces which get much more blocky, choppy, and rhytmic. Dennis Charles plays off of Taylor here, really feeling the piano as a percussion instrument, and it's a window to the future. I suspect Shepp's byline was added on this repress as he was probably an obscure sideman in 1960 or whenever this was originally released. [23 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">It's 1961 and Cecil Taylor goes into a studio with a bunch of young musicians, recording a few sessions over two days that make up <i>New York City R&amp;B</i>. There is definitely rhythm and blues; you can hear Cecil pulling against the swing of Neidlinger's bass, and it's occasionally a battle. It doesn't take long into 'O.P.' for this to become apparent; this trio recording (Billy Higgins doesn't get title billing since he's replaced by Dennis Charles on 'Cell Walk for Celeste') is playful, but it gets into moods for minutes at a time and doesn't return. The big band comes in for the last track, 'Things Ain't What They Used To Be', the title perhaps a portent of the changes to happen to American jazz that decade. We have Archie Shepp, a misspelled Steve Lac(e)y, Clark Terry, and Roswell Rudd among others. It's a carefully chosen group of musicians I think; no one overplays, and the piece breathes well, conveying a sense of nostagia (or maybe I'm just reading too much into the title).

<p class="p1">Jimmy Lyons and Sunny Murray are here, and this lengthy release is recorded quite well, culled from a live show in Copenhagen, 1962. The set revolves around several compositions which often break down into long piano explorations, sometimes solo and sometimes in group form. Sunny Murray really suits Taylor - they play their instruments in a similar manner, sprawling in a million directions while being contained as well. The title track is in two versions, one of the more darkly complected numbers when compared to the more lively jazz trio work on tracks like 'Lena' and the cover of 'What's New'. Music this radical must have really blown some minds in 1962, but I guess that's why they had to go to Denmark to perform it. Among the many Taylor records I picked up at this time, this one really stands out because it's got such diversity on it, and some real swinging bits. [10 December 2012]</p>

Actually, that's not true - they are all distinct - and this one has some poetry and vocal stuff on it too, though it's not the one that's entire poetry, which I sort of want to find, even though I know I will never listen to it. And actually, the way this is recorded and some of the heavy pounding of the lower reigsters might make this my "pick" of all the Taylor records I have - though I should look back at what I wrote about all of the others. With four sides there's just so much here to listen to and it's compelling, demanding full attention, which gives me little cause to spin it. [20 December 2012]</p>

Side one is the classic outsider freak soundball, with guitar notes raining from all directions, an uncertain rhythm, and a bunch of conflicting impulses. Side two gets into more vocal-based stuff, as there's all forms of moaning, singing and mumbling over the plodding. Some hippie flutes at the end, on the short mantra-like outro. It's a fun jam and presented in a nice bootleg format. [20 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Eno's first record is brimming with ideas; still carrying some of the more theatrical ambitions from his Roxy Music days, Warm Jets shifts between murky, fuzzed out rockers and obtuse, experimental bits. The drama is high, and tracks like "Baby on Fire" are classics. The weirder songs on the second side are pretty unrecognized for how great they are; "Blank Frank" and "Dead Finks Don't Talk" especially. The album cover is cluttered with objects, all probably conveying some hermetic meanings for Mr. Eno; for me it's a good symbol of how cluttered the music is. It's not my favorite Eno record, though I greatly enjoy it; it's just nice to see how he refined his ideas into the overarching concept of <i>Taking Tiger Mountain</i> and focused even further on <i>Another Green World</i>.

This band walks the line between prog and space-jams perfectly, utilising a shitload of Indian instruments in their druggie excursions. The strings are plucked and creep out of the corners of drone, created by mellotron and tambura; there's not a lot of conventional rock moments here until the last track, mostly letting the moments expand like their consciousness. I've never heard their other records but if they're as good as this, I probably should. [9 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Egg's debut is classic British prog-rock, with soaring yet soft vocals, keyboards and guitars in contrapuntal synchronisation, and long jammy instrumental bits. 'Fugue in D Minor' directly covers (or maybe just quotes) Bach, with a nice 60s organ vibe by Dave Stewart, and side two is the long 'Symphony no 2'. But there's a humour in balance - with titles like 'The Song Of McGillicudie The Pusillanimous (Or: Don't Worry James, Your Socks Are Hanging In The Coal Cellar With Thomas)' (actually a pretty rocking track, probably the album's best) you know we're in a certain territory. The lyrics are printed on the sleeve and they reveal a strangely sophisticated sense of irony. It's easy to see why this was seminal and led to bands like Hatfield and the North and National Health which for some strange reason I've always dug. [18 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I'm not sure what to think of this Anthony Moore album, released under the name A. More. It's nothing like his masterful <i>Pieces from the Cloudland Ballroom</i>, instead being a record of new wave-styled songs. It reminds me a bit of Eno's work circa <i>Taking Tiger Mountain</i> which is not a bad thing. The songs are catchy, and orchestrated with electric guitars, pianos, and a vaguely Bowie/futuristic sheen. "Caught Being In Love" is a standout track, maybe, though in some sense it feels overall like More of the same, ha ha. But it's impressive, especially the very dark cover of Art Bears' 'War', saturated with distorted waves of noise at the beginning and end. Moore had already proved himself through his work in Slapp Happy and the aforementioned <i>Pieces</i>, but this record shows even more versatility and it's definitely an underrated sleeper amongst music of it's time period.

I have far too many of these for any sane person to own, because how many do you really need? I tend to like different ones for their atmosphere, often for the recording quality, but this sounds like he's on a grand piano on stage, without any distinct crowd presence or particularly airyness. Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile LP and showcases his approach, at least as it was in 1976, where this was performed in Austria. It's thick, physical, and while it sometimes lightens up in terms of tone blocks, it never quite slows down or dissipates. [17 August 2012]</p>

This is the only thing I have by them, and it speaks to the part of me that loves Os Mutantes, Aphrodite's Child, and the like. There's a big focus on the high vocals mixing with the dreamy keyboards - and the thicker band sections are closer to the Beach Boys than Area. There's some super fast drum fills thrown in to mix it up and give it that progressive edge, but this is really easy listening. The vocals, being in Italian, have a gravity that I don't think applies to a lot of other bands, for example if this was a High Llamas record. It's remarkably easy to tune this out, which is probably why I wouldn't recognise it if it was played for me Invisible Jukebox-style (despite ten years of multiple listens). [5 November 2012]</p>

There's still a unified feel though, as opposed to three people blasting overtop of each other - the pieces are relatively composed, and while the album title suggests they just tossed this off in their spare time, there's such a unity here that I don't believe that. For 1981, this is a statement - coming out of the prog movement of the 70s, which led to RIO and it's avant-garde Brechtisms -- this is almost a return to simplicity, though songs like 'As-Is' are anything but. Chaos and order are constantly in flux here, but the stern confidence of all three musicians guides it through. [4 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is one of the most singular documents of music ever made, a true testament to freaks and outcasts that somehow lacks the critical reputation it deserves. Side 1 is an utter tour de force, beginning with the growing bagpipe thump of 'New Caledonia' and then descending into further and further madness. A product of its time, maybe, but this is a continual inspiration to me, and it's amazing how many different things they try out over the course of the LP. There's repetitive minimalist primitivism on side 2, a drony, exploratory soundscape that's akin to what artists like No Neck and Sunburned Hand were aping 40 years later, and even some deranged Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies. On top of it all, I don't know anything about this record - who these guys were and what, if anything, they went on to do.

This is instead a product from the Michael Nyman who wrote <i>Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond</i> - a by-the-books clinical composer, even if those books are maths textbooks or the <i>I Ching</i>. '1-100', supposedly composed for a Greenaway film but I'm I'm not sure which ones, is a degenerative sound piece built around the 'Blue Danube Waltz', where the decay of the notes is timed precisely. The recording is four different recordings, superimposed and unsynchronised, yet it's still very sparse, creating a lovely bed of space to becomes lost in. 'Bell Set No. 1' on the b-side is also built around decay but emphasises timbre more, with the different Turkish bells recorded to really explore the potential of their distinctiveness. There is a repetitious figure at the centre of it, but it's so slow and spacious that it avoids the brain-jarring staccato of his later work, instead reminding me of Joe Jones <i>Solar Music</i> without the slurryness.

When they just straight-up write a love song, like 'N.I.T.A.', it's chilling. That they never made another album makes this the central treasure of a perfect musical career. [26 July 2012]</p>

Wobble is the real star, composing most of it and also vocalising; Czukay is more a presence, felt but not always heard. The extended workouts are part Dif Juz, part mid-period Eno; it's not a sound I get that crazy about because it's hard to really enjoy any of the moments due to the overwhelming stench of "production".

<p class="p1">I find a so much of this French progressive stuff from the time to be really inspiring, because it seems so removed from any sort of rock/punk/Kraut scenes, and manages to do something unique with sound while maintaining a good humour about itself. In a way, these records become a genre unto themselves, though I wonder how much of a scene there was during all of this. This is perhaps my favorite record of the whole style (the Futura/French non-rock Prog style, that is). Some parts are surreal improvisation, and there are also some strange experimental compositions. The most famous track is "Rock and Roll Station", which many people (including myself) would consider to be brilliant, but maybe without being able to explain why. As possibly the rarest record in my collection, this would definitely be the first thing to grab if there's a fire. [10 Nov 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I always forget this album exists, which is a shame - it's an exemplary release in the early Residents story. Side one consists of several short songs, all stemming from the <i>Third Reich and Roll</i> sessions. They are mellow, with soft toned keyboards, unidentified ethnic instruments, and gentle vocals. The b-side is one long suite, originally written for a ballet, that is the most overtly Harry Partch-influenced thing I ever heard them. The tuned percussive blocks and scrapings are straight from <i>Delusion of the Fury</i> and though synths and keyboards are added, it's almost a tribute piece, and not really Residents "proper". But it's good. [17 November 2012]</p>

The weirdo, home-recorded affect is of course why he's found a renaissance in recent years but these stand up as great great songs in any context.

It's an epic, driving song, and an amazing debut release. 'Nite &amp; Day' seems to tackle the political arena, or at least address the repetition of work - and 'Litebulb Overkill' is a beautiful instrumental, led by Blaine Reininger's violin, which looks to some of the unique modal work which made Tuxedomoon fit better on Ralph than on any sort of post-punk label. This is angry, edgy, and sounds like the product of forward thinking art students in 1978, which is exactly what it is. [15 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Don't let that new wave haircut fool you - this is serious music for serious people. Except it's still "rock". Chatham is someone I've never completely understood. This is absolutely a "composition", especially side A which is called 'For Brass' and has George Lewis, Olu Dara and others. But the brass is all mixed together into a fairly underwhelming drone, which makes me wonder why he bothered getting such legends of their instruments. Anton Fier's drumming dominates and while it's nice enough, somewhat reminding me of Central African tribal drumming, it's, I dunno, just "okay". The B-sides gets more into the rock guitar/Branca thing, with James Lo taking over drumming duties. The three compositions here are fairly indistinct but have some nice moments. If you love the clangy sound of strummed electric guitar chords - and I do - then there's a lot to like here, especially when the momentum slows. [30 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I was reading an Internet messageboard last night and there was a debate about Raincoats vs. Slits, in that typical music nerd way that makes you feel you have to choose one or the other (ie: Beatles vs. Stones, Dylan vs. Neil etc.). As stupid as it was, it got me thinking about how unfortunate that these two artists always get lumped together just because they were both females from the same scene. The Raincoats have a sophistication that is almost unparalleled, but then again, they probably influenced each other more than I realised. <i>Cut</i> is considered a classic of the era, but I've never liked it half as much as their second album (which has almost no critical acclaim whatsoever, so I guess I'm just weird). It's certainly good - the more pronounced reggae/dub influences really stand them apart from other danceable punks of the time, like Gang of Four - it's a more mellow and fluid sound, but no less pointed. 'Typical Girls' is probably the most memorable track, or 'Shoplifting' (or at least they were the singles) but I really like 'Newtown' and 'Adventures Close To Home', which use the tension of the dub and the breathy background chants to really propel along something that bears only a slight resemblance to punk. I love the guitar tone throughout, which is always clean and crisp; the few keyboards that sneak in add even more colour, which I think benefits the Slits. [16 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Some time since I listened to this; there's a lot of wonderful fun I forgot all about. Somehow this mashup of 60s songs sounds fresh and genuinely subversive after all these years, or maybe this is just my bias. So many good details here - the way the voices and percussion and piano work so well on the 'hanky panky' part, the way the synths stretch fart and melt, and how genius the ending part of 'Swastikas on Parade' is. I wonder if any royalties were ever paid to the 1910 Fruitgum Company of the Human Beinz or anyone else covered here (or semi-covered) - especially the Beatles, whose 'Hey Jude' is totally disgraced and warped at the end. Maybe this is the Residents' best record overall - it's conceptual but not overly conceptual, and any track stands alone as an example of what drew me to the Residents in the first place.

The lyrics suggest sensuality through a very surrealist lens; the delivery does not pause for breath, and I'm left without any. On the b-side we get slightly more psychedelic Soft Boys tunes - 'The Face of Death, written by the whole group, has thick, multitracked guitars in a nervous style; 'Hear My Brane' has a angular, contrapuntal lead that is somewhat Beefheartian, around a song structure that's closer to Steppenwolf. Overall the whole 7" challenges the notion that the Soft Boys were a misplaced beast, out of step with their time; if anything, they were a bit ahead of it. [19 August 2012]</p>

Cale's presence and production suggests and affinity with the Velvet Underground, but there's so much more ragged glory here than on any VU record. Maybe it's the midwest vs. NYC - different attitudes, different styles, right? This record actually has a large presence of handclaps and that <i>Nuggets-</i>era production style, though with more fiery guitars. It's not as nihilistic as <i>Fun House</i> but it's still one of the most unique debuts in rock history. 'Not Right' and 'Real Cool Time' are utterly great Stooges songs that tend to be overshadowed by 'No Fun' and '1969', but I love them just as much. [28 July 2012]</p>

The serious, European delivery of the vocals and the minor key mood makes this a much darker reading than whomever did the original (I can only think of the California Raisins' version off the top of my head) and of course infused with the gender politics that are so easy to read into these bands.

There's prog-rock parts, but they aren't the main focus. Side two is centered around 'Miniplenty', another long track that is mostly spacey improvisation. The group is small here - mostly Hopper, some horns (Lol Coxhill!) and a rhythm section. Compared to the more standard jazz-rock of the other one I have, this is an entirely different beast.

<p class="p1"><i>Rags</i> is a real gem; a song cycle dealing with issues of labour and gender, built around her reeds and with a Frith/Cutler core. The male vocals are handled by Phil Minton and the female by Sally Potter; Minton gives it a very dramatic edge, which puts the Brecht/Weill influence even more full-on. This sounds like something created for a one-off performance but it stands up as an album; despite the pointed vision of the project, it's pushes for a new relationship between songcraft and musical exploration, like most of the best Cow-related projects. The ending cut of Potter singing operatically over recordings of water and a piano is magnificent. [1 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Early Tuxedomoon is dripping with young art-school tendencies, found so commonly in British post-punk circa 1979; that these guys are American doesn't really change much, as the metallic sheen and futurist foreboding carries across. It's the synth treatments, particularly on songs like 'Special Treatment for the Family Man' that make this seem underwater, and the saxophone solos add a surreal level that is almost ironic if it wasn't so creepy.

<p class="p1">Cost: $8</p>
<p class="p1">This was the Gerbils' swan song, I guess, and also probably my own last purchase from the Elephant 6-related fountain. Compared to the fun, bouncy pop of their first album and singles, this is a somewhat restrained effort. The ten titled songs are interspersed with unnamed interludes, often built around horns and mostly instrumental. The comparison to Neutral Milk Hotel's instrumental bits is unavoidable since half of the band is shared, but Jeremy Barnes's drumming isn't that spazzy and the songwriting, as much as I like it, lacks the surrealist depth of Mangum's. But these are different bands and it's nice that the Gerbils can step away from the trappings of the indie-pop genre they once inhabited. Even when they step on the fuzz pedals and start riffing, it's a bit downbeat:  'Meteroid from the Sun Strikes a Dead Weirdo' has the most classic rock overtures, and 'a Song of Love' retains some sun with great harmonies and ringing vocal hooks. I bet I listened to this once in 2001, if even, but it's actually got a lot to love about it - the 'mature' followup, clichéd even, but worthwhile, is always one for slow burns and this certainly is.

<p class="p1"><i>Blue Lake</i> is a glowing ball of beautiful sound, with Cherry's exuberant personality draped all over it. After the title track, really an introduction, Cherry, introduces his band of Okay Tamiz and Dollar Brand and then spends the next side and a half performing their compositions, which are sweet and melodic. There's a lot of piano, chanting, and percussion and a bit of trumpet, yes, but this is really a platform for Cherry's vocalising. The second LP is a track called 'East' which is long and loose, with dark modal piano segents and then some catchy, simple melodies. Johnny Dyani is on bass and works well with Tamiz to propel what would otherwise be rudimentary piano licks into something soulful. This is a wonderful Don Cherry record, like most of them, and far more accessible in the organic earthjazz swing style than others. [25 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Looking back at this disc after Six Organs has achieved much more success, I can't help but feel drawn to this earlier work more (along with <i>Dust and Chimes</i>). Not that I fault Chasny for attempting to do something different, and trying to expand upon his talents, but these darker earlier records are more evocative of the type of sound that I enjoy. The work of Alastair Galbraith and a lot of those moody Kiwis is references, and the 4-track hiss and distortion complements the songwriting well. This is not unlike the kind of thing Luke and I were trying to do in Land, and thus I'll always have some sort of soft-spot for it. Too bad Tamburo lost my copy of this. [10 Nov 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">In reading about this for a long time on one of those early 90's Thurston Moore-compiled lists of obscure noisy record that I didn't know anything about, I sort of built this up to be the ultimate in legendary free jazz. Finally buying this reissue in 2002 I was pretty disappointed by the product. The mix was terrible and it basically is a big ball of freaked-out noise, but not even a remarkable one. I think I'd take any of the European improvisers from the Dutch axis before this one, like the Globe Unity Orchestra. Of course, I am writing this without having heard it in 3 years, for when I bought it, I basically filed it after listening once and moved on.

<p class="p1">This is a really short release, under a half-hour, featuring Moncur with some Portuguese musicians and Beb Guerin on bass. Fernando Martins' piano is actually the lead instrument here, as Moncur seems content to be band leader with some mellow trombone licks here and there. The trombone does sound great - like a really bummed out trumpet at times, and it adds the right amount of colour to these numbers. Side 1's two pieces are both Brasilian traditionals, the title track being built around a beautiful sung vocal line which repeats itself in a Mixolydian mode. The originals on side two are slow and feel-good, getting into some moods here and there but generally having the feel of musicians feeling each other out. [4 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I used to have a cassette of Fugazi's <i>In On the Killtaker</i>. In 9th grade a kid named Bryan Roberts smashed it by accident, joking around, and had to give me $9 to replace it. Instead I bought this album (on cassette), and spent the summer before 10th grade listening to it on my shitty headphones over and over and over. I have very distinct memories of being in the back of my parents' Dodge Caravan listening to "Borderline" on the way to Cambridge, OH to buy fireworks. That old cassette still gets frequent play in my car. I love Camper Van Beethoven, and this record is really different for them, and had I heard it now for the first time I might not care for it, but wow, what a wonderful record. When I was 15, "alternative rock" was the whole world to me, and there's a certain mysticism I still attach to this album because of what an important role it played during my adolescent development/formation of artistic interests/etc. David Lowery's songwriting peaked here - he was able to shrug off the humour and really be serious in his ambitions, and "Sweethearts" and "June" can still bring tears to my eyes (the former was my favorite song throughout pretty much all of 1994-1996). I don't even know what I need to say about this record now. "The Humid Press of Days" strikes me as a total Beefheart tribute (which I never realized in high school) and "Jack Ruby" is a really edgy, gritty song that is unlike anything else CVB ever did. This album is essential to the existence of John W Fail. [2 Jan 2004]</p>

<p class="p1">This is Refrigerator's first 7", from around the same time as the <i>Lonesome Surprise </i>and <i>Rael</i> cassettes, which was 1991. As to be expected, it's pretty raw and cacophonous; Allen's voice is stretched like a teenager in heat, and the drumming is awesomely crap, especially on punk bursts like 'Nickel'. 'Winter Cooler Stories' is one of the best Refrigerator songs and it's hard not to love 'Junk' ("We don't sit here anymore..."). I love how bands will cram six songs onto their first 7" since they didn't have many chances to release records, so this gets a big thumbs up even if it's not the more polished, adult Refrigerator. To be honest, I love this band to the point where I love all eras of their work equally; this is great to have, especially as something I found at Jerry's! [23 July 2012]</p>

Records, containing little dissonance, and as minimalist composition goes it's very well defined. However, it's the atmosphere that really kills me here - the drift of the piano chords and the searing attack of the guitar - and I would recommend this as a starting point probably for those interested in diving into this bizarre, wonderful discography. [2 January 2004]  Is it still my favourite?  It's too hard to pick one, but on this cold Tuesday morning, <i>Knish</i> hits the spot, and I wonder if I've listened to it since last reviewed in 2004? The opening side-long piece is just majestic and sweeping, and despite being only two people it's a huge sound.  And it's actually kind of annoying at times, which I never realised before, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Side two's 'The Librarian and the Monk' (describing these two's occupations, of course) is the really pounding (or rather plinking), sharp pointy jam.  'Isabel Wears Pink' returns to the melodic, searing guitar of 'Quagmire' with a more active piano part, and it's simplicity manages to channel up dark chasms of psych goodness while still being melodic.  I actually wish this had been recorded beter - the radio station production is a bit thin at times and I love the sound of the piano.  [8 November 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">I always classify <i>Enedkeg</i> with <i>Knish</i>, as they both came out around the same time, have similar handmade covers and are really minimal pieces. 'Normal' is a great SONG - a proper song that somehow sounds like no other artist, and also like nothing else that R!!!S!!! ever made. 'More Urban Music for the Middle of Nowhere' is the masterpiece though - a slow electronic drawl that perfectly suits the title. It's the landscape of British New Towns and failed concrete dreams, and on vinyl it sounds fantastic - both cuts on side 1 would probably make it onto a R!!!S!!! greatest hits, if such a thing were possible. Side two is the lengthy 'Duet', the most drony thing these guys ever did apart from 'Goat' - and it's a lovely piece of minimalism, but a bit plain. I love what these two did in the 90s because it was so colourful and eclectic, so while this is a perfectly serviceable effort, give me <i>Red and Blue Bear</i> anyday. While 'More Urban Music' is every bit as minimal, there's so much more variation within it's running time than 'Duet' and by sequencing it like this, I can't help but get slightly bored, even when 'Duet' attenuates its tone towards pure madness.

The percussion and violin are what makes this - it's eerier than anyone could do just solo.

Voice appears as an instrument, but with the spectre of feedback always looming behind. Digital effects are all over this release, but it still feels somewhat organic, probably because these guys have such an earthy approach to sound. There's a close attention to construction and a calm patience; even though this is one of the lesser R!!!/S!!! releases it's still solid, maintaining a balance between ear candy and difficult, challenging improv.

<p class="p1">I wasn't wild about this ten years ago, though I had previously scooped up Outhud's singles, really being interested in this band who looked to merge smart contemporary punk with dub and other such rhytmic forms. My initial attraction was probably due to the marriage of musical complexity with punk ethos, though actually that was really !!! I was thinking of, and they weren't that complex. But after a long period without listening and now-fresh ears, <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. </i>reveals itself as far more interesting than I remember. A closer comparison than dub would be 80s post-punk like Rip Rig and Panic, later Slits, and various offshoots, plus some 4AD artists from the 80s like Dif Juz. The instrumental LP has a lot of dubby effects, sure, but I think it's more descended from these British artists, so it's influence through influence. The clean channel electric guitar is lovely, clanging against the sudden whooses of white noise and other textures, generated (it sounds like) from mostly cheap equipment. This sounds pretty good when loud, and also reminds me of the summer though maybe that's just cause it's summertime now. [27 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Two lengthy jams, 'Oh Strange' and 'Bon Voyage', recorded at the peak of their pre-Don Moye powers, Paris,1969. Malachi Favors handles the percussion duties, playing full drum kit on 'Bon Voyage', which explodes in a thunder of free exploration. Fontella Bass is present now and then but really this is the place for the core group to shine. And while the usual instrumentation is present - reeds, trumpet, flutes, logs, wood blocks and other little sounds - there's a lot of marimba and vibes present, thanks to Joseph Jarman. 'Oh Strange' is certainly more spacious, and if these are being presented in the order they were performed then you can feel the energy ramp up as it goes along. This is a group that has two amazing live double LPs - the <i>Live at Mandel Hall</i> is equally sprawling - and I only wish we had even more from this incredibly fertile period.

The second track is actually Albert Marcour solo, though it's billed as This Heat, and the rest of the CD is filled out by a bad-sounding CD transfer of the Health and Effieciency 12" (which "Graphic/Varispeed" included at both speeds).

<p class="p1">Cost: $9.59</p>
<p class="p1">A double 7" at 33rpm is almost an album, right? By my calculations this is 28 inches total, vs. the LP's 24 inches, and the 7 songs here are long and jammy. So considering this as an album, it's gotta rank as one of the Girls' best, though we don't think about it much cause it's in the box of rarely listened-to 7"s records and the format is a bit annoying with all the flipping. But 'Plaster Cupids Falling from the Ceiling', which opens this, is about as perfect as a signature song as any of their others. This is circa-enough the <i>Torch of the Mystics </i>period that even if they tried, they couldn't get the stench of absolute, total musical genius out of these grooves. But they are trying, if anything, to be great, and great it is. This is all epic guitar jams, built around songs which are open for exploration yet remarkably focused; the full power of psychedelic rock music in full force. Some of these have become classics for me - 'Souvenirs from Jangare','Sun Damaged My Ass!' - and it actually flows really well as an album. This was a great score for the price and my fascination with this band hasn't waned in the intervening years.  [19 December 2012]</p>

Jarrett and Hancock really dominate this, despite the other talents at play. I'm not really a huge Miles Davis fan (and I don't call him just "Miles" like many annoying University students) so this more or less satisfies the rare desire I have to indulge.

<p class="p1">Here's a record I remembered fondly from when I last listened to it six years ago; Christopher Tree, another forgotten late 60's/early 70's sound explorer who made this record inside a cathedral in 1970.  It's a one-man affair, with some percussion and more tonal drones very slowly flirted with through the duration of the album. It's extremely sparse, with Tree happy to let the room take the lead.  It doesn't completely work as deep listening/meditative music though, as there's nothing mantra-like or repetitive - it's more like a workshop, with one man testing out a variety of sounds and letting each sound count, sinking into the air for as long as he can let it.  It's not everyday listening but the thick vinyl pressing carries the sound of the room very well.

<p class="p1">This is Destroyer's second album, though probably the earliest that will ever be re-released (Bejar told me he's a bit embarassed by his first offering); it's a mixture of short song sketches performed solo and more fleshed out band pieces. The solo tracks have their moments, and their intimacy is enhanced by the sound of falling rain in the background. The more band pieces are also good, though lacking the impact of <i>Thief</i> and <i>Streethawk</i> material. And like <i>Thief</i>, the album suffers slightly from some aimless instrumental interludes. But it's nice to hear the genesis of Bejar, who really hit his stride right after this album.

<p class="p1">Dan Bejar's major "maturation" is a doozy of a pop record, and definitely a great step forward for him. The expanded production benefits him greatly; additional instrumentation is nice, though I do miss the band of the last two or three; I just couldn't imagine a song as majestic as "The Chosen Ones" coming from those guys. However, at sixty-some minutes he stretches out a little bit beyond his boundaries, causing this record to suffer from the typical "double album" syndrome. Still, this is a continuation of the infection madness by one of my favorite contemporary songwriters, and when I got new speakers the title track was the first thing I played through them.

Of course, not all music has to be pleasant. The images created by this music are very hazy, but distinct in tone; I think it's farily well done though I prefer their more accessible material.

There are definitely some three-chord punk chuggers like "Action Time Vision", but there's a lot of arty ideas that, while not always succesful, are charming in their attempts. The first track is such a fucked up way to start a punk rock LP in 1977 - I'm sure it alienated any potential fans they might have had. Mark Perry is such a snotty overintellectual punk; it feels like he's been spending too much time reading Guy Debord and not enough listening to Fun House - but the pretentious dilettante in me appreciates the results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Maybe I'm forgetting something obvious, but at 1970 this might be the earliest free jazz with electronics that I can think of (not counting AMM/MEV). Evan Parker on soprano and Derek Bailey are the big names here - with Hugh Davies on the electronics. This really isn't a far cry from what Parker's stuff is like 30 years later, though perhaps it's a bit more agitated. Percussionist Jamie Muir is pretty ramshackle, which I like a lot. This is another strong early ECM release that seems to be forgotten.</p>

<p class="p1">I haven't heard this since I was a freshman in college when I checked it out of the library. The centerpiece of the album is of course "De Futura", the side-long closer, which is really Janik Top's studio masterpiece. Side one has some more varied stuff - the opening track has this crazy percussion and horns on it that makes it sound Brazilian. The whole album is laden with over-the-top Magma singing which is ironically enjoyable - parts of "De Futura" remind me of German beer-hall singing. The chops are tight, though, with Vander's drums really being the lead instrument.</p>

And while attitude is a major component of this record too, the songwriting is actually amazing. The opening moments totally capture the fear, paranoia, and ambition of the punk times,and I can imagine myself transported back to a rainy alley in Manchester when I listen to it. Essential.</p>

But this incarnation of the Feelies - quite different from what was to come later - synthesizes punk energy with college-rock nerdyness, and knows just when to build up/release the tension. There's a throwback to sixties pop that punks were afraid to embrace ("Fa Ce La" and the Beatles cover) that really gives it a unique charm. Plus the last few tracks are just awesome ("Crazy Rhythms" and "Moscow Nights").</p>

<p class="p1">Nico's first solo album is definitely her most accessible, though its still mired in a dark, Germanic gloom. Jackson Browne's songwriting is really great and works well with her deep chanting; the arrangements are simple enough to carry the melodies and gives her room to make the songs her own. John Cale's songs sound like "All Tomorrow's Parties," but the Browne compositions are more major key, sentimental, et al. The stuff from <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i> is especially great.</p>

<p class="p3">A really dark, inaccessible record that I've always considered the Cure's finest. It doesn't really give Robert Smith a chance to show off his pop hooks, but when you really feel like listening to a dark, melodramatic goth album, this is tops. [2003] I mean, it's not <i>that</i> inaccessible - compared to <i>The Head on the Door</i> maybe a bit - but it's good.  It's actually a really primitive record, with fairly rudimentary drumming, synth drones, and guitar shards.  If it was made by a lesser known band it would certainly be showing up on some Mutantsounds type of blog with rave reviews. The last song ('Pornography') is probably my favorite, with all of these weird disembodied voices mixed in as another texture.  I was reading over some of the lyrics, and while they are very much Cure lyrics, they aren't a million miles away from something I would write.  I think they really found their voice here.  The earliest records are too much in the early Wire/post-punk mold, and the middle period of <i>Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me/Disintegration</i> doesn't do much for me with it's overly thick romanticism.  This album and <i>Faith</i> are probably my favorite releases because it's what my idea of the Cure is.  [16 Feb 2009]</p>

The only thing I could think of is that it was something Luke used to play on the radio a lot back in the WPTS days, and then an AMG search reveals that King Missile covered it on <i>The Way to Salvation</i>. Geez. Anyway, this record doesn't need a lot of describing. Allegedly a "punk" record, it actually has strong melodic and technical appeal; parts sound a lot like Television, not surprising since Hell was a founding member. There's some great guitar riffs (thanks to Robert Quine) and a real New York attitude that sounds almost comforting to me because I've listened to <i>Marquee Moon</i> so many times.

Lyrically Gang of Four were wrapped up in their political pretensions, but if Greil Marcus is to be believed they were hitting the mark right on (and I don't think their lyrics are ever embarassing or awkward). "Anthrax" is as postmodern as punk can get and it rocks too. "Damaged Goods" deals with the issue of romance as a commodity in a thoughtful manner. I'm glad to finally own this on vinyl.</p>

[12/5/2003]   Funny to read my review from 2003 as I randomly pulled this out to listen to again.  This actually reminds me a lot of Canterbury-style prog at times.  There aren't as many insane time signatures and the chordal movement is pretty obviously Western.  On Magma stuff I enjoy the most, there's an almost tropical quality that comes, i guess, from the invented language.  <i>Mekanik Destrutik Kommandöh</i> feels more operatice I guess because of the female vocals.  There's some chilling ghost singing and the occasional bell/chime to really poke out of all the rack-effects guitar; I like this more than I thought I would.  I wish the repeitive parts wouldn't change keys constantly, cause this would sound more like Circle or something.  [6 Aug 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">Assembled by Fred Frith, this compilation presents radical approaches to the guitar from several different artists. It's great to hear how little guitar experimentation has changed - there's nothing that makes this material seem dated in any way. It's hard to tell when one artist's work ends and another begins, so I'm not certain who is who - but Frith chose material that worked well together. There are electronics effects used in most pieces, and some get pretty frantic (Davey Williams). Akira Iihjima's piece is very tranquil, and works well to close. It's hard not to compare this to <i>Wooden Guitar</i>. [2 December 2003]</p>

<p class="p1">Assessing this, one of the most overrated compilations of all time, is somewhat difficult. It's as much of a document of it's time as any of the other great comps listed below, but one I always felt was overrated, mostly due to the way in which kids today obsess over this stuff. There are some undeniably great things on here - like the Contortions tracks, which are their best - but other bands who don't fare as well 20 years later. It's hard to really listen to something without associating all of the cultural baggage that goes with it; in this case, tons of dumbass imitation no-wave bands who just want to sound like DNA and make the originals sound sour. But when I try, it's hard to not be moved by the Contortions bounce, or the first Mars track which is so fucking great (too bad the rest are so mediocre). I haven't heard this record in a few years, and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks doesn't sound any better to my ears. It's weird how I like some inept, primitive music (early Half Japanese comes to mind) but some i don't. I guess it's all in the attitude - TJ&amp;tJ just don't do it for me cause I think they are trying too hard. [3 December 2003]</p>

It's sort of like listening to one of those old <i>Bloodstains</i> comps, but without as much variety. This is probably the earliest recorded Flesheaters stuff and it's a lot more raw than the stuff I'm familiar with - it actually reminds me of Dead Kennedys with less of a surf influence. The Germs stuff has some damaged piano playing that sounds very sampled, but it's about the only break from the formula. I think I was a bit disappointed by the Negative Trend stuff.

Kevin Coyne makes an appearance sounding quite a bit like JJ Cale; the Misunderstood have a real Nuggets-style thing going on; Eyeless in Gaza sound good too. Are the Marine Girls the antecedent of Scrawl? Atilla the Stockbroker's spoken word track is a fun period piece; Quetin Crisp's is a bit more intellectual.

Byard, actually, steals the show, since Mingus and Richmond are pretty much inaudible due to the pisspoor mastering job on this record.

<p class="p1">Felt's first album doesn?t pack the punch of "My Face is On Fire," but that doesn't mean it's a bad record. Structured around ringing, jangly guitars, this is a moody slice of angst. The Verlainisms of Lawrence's delivery give it the swagger it needs to distinguish itself from wimpy jangle pop. There's a simplicity to this music that doesn't overwhelm it, and the reverb is well used. Listening to all of this 80's UK stuff lately is starting to take it's toll on me, but I finally understand those who use this as their canon. The hypnotic plundering of "Birdmen" is probably the winner here.</p>

<p class="p1">Echo and the Bunnymen's most familiar tune is on this record ("The Killing Moon") but the rest of the record is a solid pop record. I've never been a huge Echo and the Bunnymen fan but maybe I should check out their other records. Ian McCulloch's voice contains just the right about of drama to it, a few steps below Robert Smith but still sounding earnest. The last song on side 1 is a bit of a misstep, though he actually sounds like David Ackles at one point! Overall it's a very polished record that lacks the "punk" edge of the earlier stuff, but it's a respectable record.</p>

<p class="p1">Lilliput are so inspiring to me because they took punk as a starting point for expressing their own weirdness, rather than using punk as a template for identity, like so many groups today. The "gimmicky" elements - that they are all-female, and sang in a made-up language - seem almost irrelevant, because their music is so excellent. I first read about Kleenex/Lilliput in that Greil Marcus piece in "Ranters and Crowd Pleasers" and searched forever for their records. Now that Kill Rock Stars has issued that double CD, Lilliput are able to be heard by everyone And like the Raincoats and Essential Logic, this is music that is definied by it's femininity - not just the members' genders, but in terms of a left-hand, feminine approach to songwriting. In a million years I would probably never write music like this. It's inside and outside at the same time, a testament to their genius.</p>

<p class="p1">The only other Gunter Hampel I have ever heard is his first record, <i>The 18th of July 1969,</i> which is a wonderful ball of free improvisation held together by blistering piano lines and Jeanne Lee's transcendent vocals. This later recording is much more restrained, with a similar melodic emphasis that is heard in other great European bands like ICP Orchestra. Without a percussionist, the group dances around Hampel's melodic structures, some whimsical and some earthy, with Lee present again to provide harmonic vocals. The first piece, "Folksong", is open yet alive; the title track (split over two sides) goes on a bit longer and stretches out into some more chaotic parts, yet never gets bogged down in "too much too fast" like many other pieces from this period.

There are a lot of songs on here, mostly American traditionals, hymns, spirituals, etc. It's a bit much to listen to all at once, but it definitely captures some feeling besides just a bunch of people singing. This is like a Faulkner novel in musical form.</p>

<p class="p1">Holy shit! Why did I wait so long to get this? As part of my recent obsession over all things SCG I tracked this down - it's a pretty amazing, overly long collection of the more ethnic-veering SCG's stuff. And I might go as far as to say that this is the definitive SCG record, even though I haven't fully digested it yet - cause a definitive SCG record would have to be a bit excessiev to mirror the excess of their career/personalities. The first track is perhaps my favorite SCG song to date - it's a brilliant apeing of Southeast Asian pop, or at least what i would imagine Southeast Asian pop to sound like. the only parts i really don't like are the gamelan pieces beacuse it just sounds like they're dicking around on gamelan instruments (which they are). it's not as ha-ha goofy as the other triple LP, either. Stunning, essential, blah blah blah.</p>

But this record ranks among one of their best, though it's a collaborative work. Recorded in a large room, this is a fantastic record of acoustic ambient/drone. Keenan's parts (at least what I think are his) sound wonderful and it makes me forgive him for owing me money. Eric Clark builds metal instruments that sound like scraped bowls, and it's like a more devloped revisit to the beginning of <i>Empty Bell</i>. The room is really the star of the record though - everything seems to expand under it. This record has the potential to be truly magical. (Note: listened to at 33rpm)</p>

It reminds me of the Close Lobsters only a bit more happy; maybe a similarity to the Chills too. It definitely sounds like early 80's pop - a very C86 sound, of being young and innocent. Some more produced parts even feature female backing vocals - the song "LOVE Love" is an Al Green cover. Come on down to the arcade, where we laugh at our afflictions in the window.

It's not without any merit, but it doesn't grab me at all. Despite all of the lightning fast guitar riffs and keyboard runs, I find myself bored. Wichmann says that his main measure of whether a film is "good" or not is whether it's boring or he keeps interested.

This is a fun, lighthearted record with great mccartney hooks and really dirty, lo-fi production. Linda's voice is really compressed and strange sounding (probably to hide the fact that she can't sing) and even though there's some filler, it's still FUN filler.

I don't really know what else I can say about this album; it's one of the masterpieces of it's time and a stunning statement from a pop genius. The instrumentation is a commentary and tribute to traditional and popular music of America, going over the top with strings, etc., all swirling around the solitary voice of V. D. Parks. And the lyrics? They continue to be an inspiration to me, both in the way they reflect a love of American culture as well as for their arty and mysterious tendencies. The final few songs all deal with communism Coming to america in the 1960's, as far as I can tell, and every time i listen (and i've probably listened to this record sixty or seventy times) I find myself thinking.</p>

Production-wise Youngs has gone totally over the top with this one, layering effects and instrumentation that feels unncessary, because it doesn't really help the songs. (in the past i've always felt that his best song-based stuff was the most stripped down, like <i>Advent</i> or <i>Sapphie</i>). But after the third listen I realized that Youngs is really celebrating all psychedelic folk music (which also explains the goofy cover) and he's produced another great record, perhaps not as timeless as <i>Festival</i> or <i>Sapphie</i>, but another very solid statement.</p>

It's an impressive 53 minutes of drumming accentuated by sea conches, which at times gets insanely, insanely fast (particularly on the track 'Fedu Hunguhungu', where the drums, cascading vocals and I guess conches sounds completely insane, almost like fast techno music). As a layman, I'd say that it sounds like what you'd expect a cross between Caribbean music and African music to sound like. The voices are really strained at points, moaning in different cadences and really quite disorientating. The conch shells give everything a really awesome flavour, but the drum is still at the core of this. [18 September 2012]</p>

Its a lot to listen to, and I question if I really need two full CD's of it, but it's a very nicely put together package full of liner notes that I might someday read.

The music on this disc all hails from the "mainland" island and was recorded in the late 70's. It's dominated by one particular perfomer, who has a really gentle, expressive voice. The Creole language is like a sexier French and many of the songs are pretty melodies sung over a very sparse accompaniment.

The group pieces employ a call and response vocal technique that reminds me of Latin pop music - the kind you hear in Mexican restauraunts - and also of the Calypso music on the London is the Place for Me comp. While that vocal style is characteristic of that part of the world, it's still somewhat surprising how alike it all is. [19 December 2003]</p>

"God is my Solar System" shows their more goofy side, I guess, with a some parts reminding me of Starship Beer. The vocals get to be a bit much by the end (and it's long - all four sides are quite long). "Superpower" sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday, and shows the group in a more "out" mode, featuring a paranoid spoken part that is the predecessor to "Napoleon and Josephine".

Side B is Stapleton at his best - a lengthy, dark track with lots of room to get lost -- seriously ranking up there with Solliquy for Lilith.</p>

<p class="p1">Gil - thank you so much for this one! This record is the classic example of "WEIRD FOLK". Her haunting voice cycles through what would be a good sixties folk record, but the electronic treatments are really the amazing thing. Using nothing but her voice and guitar as source material, there's crazy creeping electronics throughout the whole record that take an amazing step forward (Animal Collective, anyone?). The opening track is a Leonard Cohen poem that's chanted in a most chilling manner - it makes the record right there. Some tracks have a rock backing band that take it in a Jefferson Airplane direction, though her voice sounds a bit like Sandy Denny's at times.</p>

Lyrics included as well, which illustrate the not-quite-tangible direction of the songwriting - it's admirable, to a fan of obtuse lyricism like myself. If I had been just a little older, Thinking Fellers would have probably been my idols - and in an EP form, it's the perfect amount to digest.

The easiest way to describe this is to say it's like if early Pavement was crossed with weirder psychedelic music. There's definite "indie rock" moments but also excursions into darker psych/folk. At this point in my tastes it's impossible to not appreciate this on some level. I should seek out their other records.</p>

Maybe they're just revisiting old territory, but they do it well. This will be definitely one to play late at night with the lights off while i muse on my loneliness....

This maximallist masterpiece contains 9 of the songs they've been playing live in the past two years, done up in a heavily psychedelic style. The horns are quieter in the mix than they are live, which focuses more on the "core" band, I guess, but also takes away a lot of the impact. I listened to this five times in a row when I got it, and while I love it, there's a few songs I was sad to see aren't on here. I really oughta put out CD of the slower, sadder Johnsons material.</p>

It's a very clean, crisp-sounding record, with Dransfield's voice having a bit more of a traditional lilt to it than, say, Richard Thompson. He plays all of the instruments, including some fiddle, though it's mostly acoustic guitar. Split about 50/50 between covers and originals, Dransfield has a bright sense of melody. Sometimes I question why an obscure, forgotten record like this is so much more exciting than a known classic - but obscurity breeds interest, at least among people like me.</p>

There's something very delightful about their approach, with an extremely fuzzed out guitar and dancey vibes over some hotshot drumming; and the compositions are very bouncy and alive. A feelgood party record. [2003]  This record is such an oddity; it's a pretty adventurous fusion jazz record but it has this childlike wonder to it due to the songs and lyrics.  I remembered this fondly but I forgot how sick the guitar leads are.  I don't usually like vibe-oriented jazz but it works here because it mellows out the attack of everything else.  The record sounds great too. The tonal instruments are fuzzy and thick, and the drums sound tinny, clattery, and thin which serves to make the whole thing feel lighter than it really is.  This is a cool album for sure; the one original composition, 'All You Need to Make Music', is as cute as the Carmichael tunes and I never realised it was written by Stark.  The first seven letters of the alphabet are all you need to make music, in case you were wondering.  [4 Jan 2009]</p>

The longer piece at the start of Side two sounds almost like Nurse with Wound if NWW had Attention Defecit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

I'm getting to be such a fan now that I loved this at the first listen, but i wouldn't recommend it as a starting point. The opening lyrics to "Hospitality on Parade" are brilliant and set the tone for the weirdness to come; I really love "Under the Table with Her" cause I can't figure out exactly how perverse it is.

<p class="p1">Sparks' first album (before they were Sparks) and it might be one of the best. The songwriting is at it's weirdest but the arrangements (thanks to Todd Rundgren) are really quirky and tripped out - less bombastic than the later stuff. This really makes me want to find <i>A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing</i>. Side two has some less exciting moments, where you can tell the band hasn't really found their identity, but it ends with "No More Mr. Nice Guy" which is a foreshadowing of the greatness to come. "Fletcher Honorama" is one of those brilliant, underrated pop songs that has only grown on me after a few weeks.</p>

<p class="p1">A collaborative 7" between Youngs and this group I have never heard of that is not the most exciting thing I have ever heard.

Nothing gels compositionally, but I bought it anyway cause I'm such a Richard Youngs fanatic. [12/22/2003]</p>

<p class="p1">The second O.Rang CD is similar to the first - lush, detailed music that defies categorization. There's a lot of field recordings (or field recording-esque) ethnicy stuff mixed in with a solid rhythm section, to create some sort of hybrid dance/world music/psychedelia. There's more singing on this one which is a bit underwhelming. It's easy to see how Talk Talk split into Mark Hollis and O. Rang - the soupiness of <i>Laughing Stock</i> moved on here while Hollis took the restraint.</p>

I'm sure that I could grow to love this as much as I love Flop, over time, but time is something I don't really have. He has a solo album that's only available through amazon.com; reviews say it's mostly acoustic and very depressing - I should order it!</p>

It's strong organic nature is a big appeal to me, for it's the type of meditative drone I feel most connected to. Ringing tones drift off, and my mind follows til it becomes difficult to even notice the more strident gestures of the musicians. i think they have a full-length "real" CD on Family Vineyard that I'd like to hear - perhaps i will order it from secretly canadian. Now that I have finally heard Jeweled Antler, I have a leg up on Gil, who merely owns all of their CD's but has never listened to any.</p>

<p class="p1">Here's a weird confession - I don't know anything about the discography of Van Morrison beyond <i>Astral Weeks.</i> That may not seem like much of a confession, but I think it's odd that I can love a record as much as <i>Astral Weeks</i> yet never venture into anything else he ever recorded. I guess I always assumed it was all like "Brown Eyed Girl". So here's a random later Van Morrison album, and it's free so I can't say no. And it's quite a different animal than <i>AW</i> - it's a slicked out singer-songwriter record, with strong R&amp;B leanings - which I guess is what I expected. The first track is packed with horns, but the rest of the record has a more acoustic base. But while <i>AW</i> is lilting, loose and drifting, this record (and most of the rest of his career, I imagine) is very slick - performed well, of course, but lacking the, I dunno… mystery? … of <i>AW</i>. His voice still sounds great, and while he never experiments with much, it's familiar to me and I find these songs more likeable than if they were performed by someone else. Still, I don't think I'll be running out to get the rest of his catalog anytime soon. [8 December 2003]</p>

<p class="p1">This fall I fell in love with <i>Paris, 1919</i> - it has the same lush intellectual feel that <i>Taking Tiger Mountain</i> has, yet it's more emotional. This is the record that came after it, and it's also very good - a lot more rocking, perhaps replacing sentimentality with aggression. There are less memorable songs than <i>Paris</i>, but I think I can safely say I prefer Cale's pop songwriting to his avant/classical/instrumental work. John Cale's solo career is an incredibly difficult thing for me to get a handle on; I guess I'll have to investigate more of his stuff!</p>

<p class="p1">I never had listened to this record all the way through before, but one night I was just in the mood to hear some Stones, so I threw it on, and now I understand the appeal. They sound, well - "badass" - on this record, yet it's a bit much - too excessive, too unfocused, and too ambitious. Which is exactly why it's the perfect Rolling Stones album!!! [2003] It's funny to look back now at my thoughts on <i>Exile</i>. Over the years since my interest in 'classic rock' has really amplified and I tow the party lines on many things. I'm uneven on the Stones; listened to this a million times, with particular memories during the Tuned City festival of driving around Tallinn listening to 'Sweet Virginia' over and over to release me from the relentless week of sound art (not that I didn't enjoy it all); plus many couch-diving living room moshpits during the Glasgow years to 'Rip This Joint'. But still I barely ever listen to <i>Let it Bleed</i> and I don't know <i>Sticky Fingers</i> at all. I have my whole life to listen to the Stones cause they'll always be around, but this is generally (with <i>Beggars Banquet</i> satisfying enough that I don't feel the need to go beyond it).

<p class="p1">Barbieri recorded this in 1968 - and I noticed that there is a CD reissue on Actuel of these two, so perhaps this is from the same sessions? Dollar Brand strong melodic sense is present in his compositions, which have a murkyness to them - like an aural equivalent of Edward Gorey, perhaps. When Barbieri starts cooking, his tone is unmistakable. He sticks to the sax throughout this record, while Brand plays the inside and outside of a piano, cello (I think) and the ever-popular "little instruments" like bells and light percussion. Barbieri's compositions on the other side are more in line with an experimental jazz duo recording. It's remarkable to hear this stuff being recorded in 1968 - even in the height of free jazz culture, I didn't realize these types of duo records were made back then (at least Interstellar Space has drums!).

<p class="p1">Banana is ripped, but there. An original! It's beat to hell (side two is so scratched it's almost unlistenable), but I can still say I found an original copy of this in someone's attic. Records like this are hard to review because they're so influential that there's really nothing left to say about them. So here is a personal anecdote: I first bought this album used on cassette for $3 at Eide's when I was in eight grade - maybe seventh, actually. I remember coming home and playing side 2 first, cause that's what it was rewound to, on this weird old combo thrift store stereo that I used to listen to music on. What a stereo it was - I remember the radio had a digital tuner and you could tune in even numbers, like 92.2, and there was a horrible built-in turntable that I used to use to dub records from the library, like INXS and Led Zeppelin. I played this album in the dark, and everything I read about "Heroin" was true - it WAS scary! Cale's viola part sounded like piercing feedback but I loved it; my mom almost immediately told me to turn it down but I was a fan. I don't think I was ready for "The Black Angel's Death Song" or "European Son" quite yet. Now when I listen to this album, those tracks jump out (probably because I've grown up to be an obtuse art-rocker). "Sunday Morning" is a pretty fantastic pop song, and I only now appreciate the Teutonic gloom of "All Tomorrow's Parties". Before I knew more about music, I thought of most of the indie rock I listened to as either derived from the VU or the Beatles - as if those were the only two paths that could be taken. Yet in a similar way, I still feel that there is something "missing" from people who do not "get" the Velvet Underground. [8 December 2003]</p>

I've always appreciated the sheer perversion of the songwriting - I mean, look at 'Everyone's Gone to the Movies' -- but the precision and obsession of the musical vision has always left me a little bit shut out. I'm not horrified by it - I like it actually, as a continuation of the perversity, or rather a complement - but I can't feel inspired by it at all. Some of the songs here are really beautifully written, like 'Your Gold Teeth II' and 'Bad Sneakers'.

One track in particular is a great secular folk song that's very edgy, and I think I?m going to try to figure out how to play it (though I certainly can't sing it) - and it's about a burro!</p>

This is probably the strangest Sparks album I've heard, even more than Indiscreet, and full of incredible songs that hint at the brilliance to come on their next two. "Whippings and Apologies" may be the best Sparks song I've never heard before, and Earl Mankey wrote a song that's good enough to pass for a Maelstrom. I should throw this on a tape with Indiscreet for the car.</p>

The songs fades in and out almost by accident, and has the feeling of a disturbing dream, for the rhythm never quite takes hold. Side two starts with a more grounded rocker (though it's still slow), held more steady and with more clearly-recorded guitars. The last track is a fractured electronic haze, distorted in a way that sounds like an old tape being eaten. I would like to hear more Bardo Pond that sounds like this song. [14 December 2003]</p>

This EP could be an LP depending on what speed you choose to play it at; I'll go with 45rpm here. I quit keeping up with new Stars of the Lid records because they seemed to be redundant, but that in no way lessens my appreciation of them. Their music is so simple on the surface, yet so detailed, and it is enjoyed in differnet ways dependng on how loud you play it. Side one is a bit bleaker, appropriately enough as it's music for <i>La Jetée</i>; side two has a bright, yet rusty sheen to the ambience and it subtly mixes in field recordings. Actually, it's a live performance, so it's actual crowd noise, but it works in a similar way. On this side, the surface noise is more readily absorbed into the music. One of their best releases, I guess. [8 December 2003]</p>

There's a great black and white booklet inside, tucked into a little pasted-on pocket. The recording has a much more ragged feel than that Rykodisc triple CD I have; everything is tinnier, and more clangy - it's harder to trance out into a smooth soundgasm. The monkey chant is at the end of side 1, and there's a side-long piece with lots of singing. I think I prefer this to the CDs, possibly because I like listening to things in mono and there's something more romantic about this older ethnomusicological approach.

This is an album of love songs, and the most delicate ones would woo any lovely lady, I think. "Commune" amazes me - not only is it utterly beautiful, but the lyrics hint at an engrossing mysticism. "Twelve Hours of Sunset" also featured David Bedford's string arrangements, and they are perfect - timbrally accentuating Harper's voice without being tacky or overdone.

There's a full lyrical translation included in the liner notes, but it doesn't increase my interest in the narrative. Musically, the Plastic People's debt to Zappa is really apparent, as this reminds me of of European avant-rock cabaret, like Floh de Cologne. There aren't epic Zappa-like guitar solos, thank God, but rather a ramshackle string section, fusion-style electric piano, and guitars that (at the best moments) remind me of late Ex: ragged, aggressive, and punchy. The improvised moments are few and far between, but there's a huge RIO feel to those parts. Overall, I'm lukewarm. [29 July 2012]</p>

I can't understand a word but that doesn't stop his conviction from coming through - there's an earnestness in every wave of vibrato when he sings, and I like the tropical/island arrangements as well. Sometimes Portuguese sounds a bit like Russian to me, and no one believes me when I say that, but there are a few parts of these songs where you can definitely hear it. I wonder if he is like the Perry Como of Brasil and this is a really silly record to enjoy - and I also wonder how this compares to other works the vast Nascimento discography. It snowed today - the first major snow of the year, so this is a funny thing to listen to when looking out the window at this very different hemisphere. It doesn't warm me up, but strikes me as absurd to juxtapose the two.

Side two is the lengthy "One of Those Days in England" that is truly epic - with orchestra at times, but veering back to Roy and his guitar. The lyrics are a very negative look at the social problems affecting the country then, with some strange lines ("rolling spliffs for Captain Kirk").<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It's about <i>The Prisoner</i>, and it never gets repetitive or dull thorughout it's eighteen minutes. The rock accompaniments sound great here - it's like my favorite type of folk-rock. I think this is his third album.</p>

<p class="p1">Lifemask is based around a near-death experience that Harper had, and as you can imagine, it's very charged and affirming. Even the more stripped down songs use a clean electric guitar instead of the acoustic sound I love, and they burn with a remarkable intensity. But I think I prefer the more gentle side of Harper, so this wouldn't be one of my favorites. The side-long piece on side 2, "The Lord's Prayer", gets to be a bit repetitve and isnt as successful as "McGoohan's Blues" or any of the songs on <i>Stormcock</i> (but the long spoken word part at the beginning is pretty cool). Still, this has "All Ireland" which is pretty great. [3 December 2003]</p>

There's a Gordon Lightfoot cover that is really crazy and good, with all of the guys singing.</p>

<p class="p1">A masterful record constructed around four long almost-all acoustic songs, this is my favorite Roy Harper album, I think. The lyrics address relationships and religion with equal bitterness, and Jimmy Page actually plays a kickass solo that makes the song better (and isn't excessive!). It sounds like he's singing "Dan Onorato, Dan Onorato" on side two, so maybe I should send it to Onorato's campaign manager. The long songs here work extremely well, a lot better than the one on <i>Lifemask</i>; the very slight arrangements by David Bedford sound a little out of place, for I would have preferred an all-acoustic album, but he more than makes up for it on other Harper records. I would probably recommend this as the starting point for an interested Roy Harper fan.</p>

All are traditional, but the arrangements sure aren't; 'Gower Wassail' sets the tone at the beginning as Carthy intones over a stark, repeated electric guitar chord. They resist the urge to get too rocking OR too folk, instead staying balanced on this middle ground and playing to their strengths, which are vocal harmonies, interpretations , and musicianship. While I love Maddy Prior, Carthy's vocals are a bit more enjoyable, especially on 'Four Nights Drunk' where it twists around with the fiddle magnificently.Throughout there is a lot of range, from the fun (the 'Reels' medley, in particular) to the intense ('When I Was on Horseback'). It's an exemplary effort all around. [2 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a late period Shirley and Dolly record with a bunch of medieval instrumentation and Barry Dransfield on fiddle and voice. The two tracks I love both feature Dolly on piano instead of the ubiquitous organ. One is by Richard Thompson, 'Never Again', a bit at odds with the traditional vibe of the record but Thompson is of course saturated in that aesthetic anyway. But 'Gilderoy' is the real tragic piano ballad, despite it's rolling, uplifting notes. Philip Pickett plays a lot of instruments I've never heard of like the gittern and shawm - seriously, check out the Wikipedia entry for the shawm, it's fascinating - and there's a long medley at the end of side 1 that's almost like a definitive neo-trad take on this all. Dolly actually plays synthesiser a few places, but it's really subdued and nothing like, say, Sun Ra's <i>Atlantis</i>. The psychedelic nature of Shirley and Dolly Collins is all in the aesthetic, not in individual freakouts. [9 November 2012]</p>

A live album showcasing all of his different styles (though with an abundance of songs from Lifemask/Valentine), this has some really weird parts, like the side-long "Highway Blues"/"One Man Rock and Roll Band" which is buried in electronic alterations, delayed vocals, and flange effects. The sound quality and performances are so solid that it's easy to forget this is a live record - his voice is flawless on these tracks, especially the bittersweet "Another Day". "Commune" is another standout - the kind of song that just entrances you with it's beauty and depth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Overall Dando Shaft has really excellent musicianship, moreso than most of their contemporaries. However, they don't really gel and feel like a real band. There isn't as much flutey shit on this one, just lots of plucking and strumming, with eclectic enough instrumentation but nothing excessive. And it's on RCA's ultra-shitty Dynaflex vinyl, the worst idea ever. I'd like to find the third album.</p>

<p class="p1">How crazy that this was released on Virgin? This compilation features contributions by Fred Frith, G.F. Fitzgerald, Hans Reichel and Derek Bailey, so with heavyweights like that, it's sure to be good. This was curated really well, because side 1 puts Frith and Fitzgerald together and their pieces sound like they could have come from the same mind. Both take on the guitar as if trying to conjure dead ghost voices from it. There's a wonderful static around everything, and Frith's piece reminds me of the casual but amazingly beautiful opening section he played when I saw him in concert last year (though this was over 25 years earlier). Fitzgerald, who made that brilliant <i>Mouseproof</i> album that I heard at Laurence Coleman's place back in 2001, has a similarly processed electroacoustic approach, which is all glowing stars and burning embers. On the flip, Reichel's crazy homemade two-neck guitar has an alien aesthetic, full of impossible counterpoint and recorded in a very close, very in-your-face way - almost the opposite of side 1. And then Bailey closes it out with a sparse, minimal Derek Bailey thing, which is also very up-front though there's a lot of room in between the notes here. [12 July 2012]</p>

Waldron's approach to sound construction is extremely careful and delicate, though there is an improvised feel for much of this, particularly at the end where there is an irregular rumbling underneath the beautiful, placid drones. Much of this disc is constructed on deep, fluid sounds, with higher sonorities on top - bells and pings, which now actually sound a bit like someone is receiving a text message. It's beautiful and contemplative, and actually a bit loose compared to some of his more intricate work. [25 July 2012]</p>

The artwork, all inkjet printed in my edition, completely occupies that subgenre of HNAS, Beta-Lactam Ring, etc in aesthetic and intent, but I think Waldron's style is a bit different - more playful, even in a genre that embraces playfulness.

The <i>Rock Bottom</i>/<i>Ruth</i> songs are totally amazing here, more intense and driving than the album versions with just solo piano. The "We've Got an Arts Council Grant"/"Righteous Rhumba" stuff isn't incredible but amusing and important I guess to signify his transitional period. "Little Child" is a wonderful old song that is actually hurt a bit by Wyatt's vocals being less than perfect (for the first time in his career, really).

The textural qualities are stunning and the dry, digital airyness is something that they've captured very well. When the heavier beats come in, like on side 2, I just find it distracting, which probably explains why I've never been able to appreciate this genre as anything more than a now-and-then treat.

As expected, this ranges from very constructed sound collages (Origami Republika's work is genuinely scary at points), simple bedroom songs, and half-baked experiments.Thurston's track is short but beautiful; Brother JT presents one of his more far-out spoken tracks, which is truly paranoid and whacked-out. The Bingo Trappers are fairly straightforward and it's a great song; Plover's the next cut and it's just as feel-good. All in all, this is a great portrait of music happening in 1997 that was removed from any specific radar; as that's a year right in my own 'golden period' of music at its aesthetic peak, this is a lovely artefact to own.

<p class="p1">Assessing a new Robert Wyatt CD is a pretty difficult task. When dealing with an artist whom I love as much as Wyatt, it tends to take me awhile to digest the material. So even though I've been listening for two months, bear with me. This is the longest album he has ever done - seventy-five minutes, split into two parts so it can be properly called a "double album". Of course you would expect some filler here, but none of the tracks are really "filler" in the traditional sense. Instead, the whole album falls into the same category of his last two releases -still good, yet somehow not as relevant as his earlier masterpieces. Which is fine - you can't expect a sixty year old ex-prog rocker to turn out charged, passionate music like a youngster can. Instead, Wyatt seems to be happy sketching out his musical ideas, collaborating with his friends, and sharing the results with us. And I'm delighted that he still continues to do this. Michael Mantler's daughter Karen has a strong presence here, writing two tracks and singing on others; and her style of abstraction works well with Wyatt's. The arrangements are similar to <i>Shleep</i> and <i>Dondestan</i>, with a heavy reliance on his synthesizers - to the point that it takes on a New Age feel. His lyrics, often written with or by Alfie Benge, continue in the poetic style of these recent releases, though they get pointed at times. Like on "Theme for Hamaza", the end of the first half, which is a somber reflection on the Iraq war (and the album also ends with an instrumental piece that originally had lyrics, printed in the booklet, of a similar theme). This political content is relevant, but not sloganistic like his earlier stuff; the hammer-and-sickle-waving Robert Wyatt seems to be gone, and instead we have a more mature artist who is still passionate, still hopeful. There's some quirky bits, recalling his experiments with <i>Ruth</i>/<i>Richard</i>, and his jazz leanings tend to come out more. While this record feels more 'easy' and 'pleasant' than his most classic albums, it's still wonderful in that Robert Wyatt way. But nothing here even attains the edge of "Free Will and Testament"; it's a very comfortable record. And in his heyday, he made records that were very much uncomfortable. [9 December 2003]</p>

<p class="p1">An album-length cd-r from Chris Rosing that seems torn between wanting to be an experimental electronics record and idm. Not as completely discombobulated as the other stuff I've heard him do, this has some midrangey buzzing drones that are quite nice. Some tracks have vocals, which are interesting; when they are surreal it works, and serves to separate his music from a lot of other electronic artists. But the last track is just a total joke "insane" monologue that devolves into bathroom humour, and while I have no problem with this in theory, I don't know why he chose to end the disc this way. Of course, I still don't understand his aesthetic.</p>

<p class="p1">The 7" with Earth Trumpet hints at what a Paddenless Bear would be like - darker, and less folky. The LP is a beautiful item, pressed onto 180g vinyl or heavier, and the thing sounds great. There are moments where Nick and Aaron are just playing violin and drums, but they are creeping along slowly, testing each other out, the violin laden with electronic processing. These moments are probably my favorite parts, especially because of the way in which they are recorded. There's tons of space between things, and because of this the music has room to breathe and develop. It's pleasant to get lost in the reverberation of these instruments.</p>

Gregg Girl Talk's backing track is definitely one of the highlights, though it doesn't really fit with the GB sound - Gregg has become a remarkable wizard behind the computer. The sixteen minutes of this disc go by quickly, but they are smart in keeping it short. I like Grand Buffet when they are at their most strange, and this definitely has some moments but overall isn't as fucked up as what they are capable of. There isn't as much of a Pittsburgh theme to this record as one might think, despite their antics at the release show.

I guess this is breakcore - incredibly fast, skittery beats constantly varying in rhythm, while flourishes of synth string pads swell up in the background.  Though the rhythms are complex, everything else is fairly minimal; lots of space is there behind the beats.  I try to be appreciative of this type of music but by the second half of side 2 I was totally annoyed and wanted ot turn it off.  How people can be mostly interested in this kind of music is a mystery to me.  The sounds and images are so limited, it's too herky-jerky to dance to, and I can't listen deeply because the beats irritate my consciousness.  I don't mean to be a hater though, as there's something technically impressive about what Ryan has done - it's just not my scene, man.  [16 Feb 2009]</p>

Gil is right- you really need the booklet to make this enjoyable, so it mostly succeeds as a conceptual art piece - though on it's own, some of the music is quite good (in that Renaldo and the Loaf kind of way). It's easy to accuse this joke as being disrespectful to the music of other cultures, but if anything I think it points out the unity of music throughout the world, and lampoons the seriousness in which ethonomusicologists often take themselves.

Why this isn't mentioned when people talk about tripped-out, over the top psych records is beyond me. There's 28 songs, I think, and they jump between styles and production methods so haphazardly that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what you're listening to; but there are some moments of incredible genius. This might be the precursor to Guided by Voices, except produced very well (employing just about every studio trick imaginable). This particular ebayed copy is pretty worn out though - it has the nice die-cut cover, and there are only a few surface scratches, but the record just sounds beat, like it's been played too many times. And with so many short tracks running together, this might actually be a good candidate for CD purchase (though I hate to say it).

Instead of a tossed-off recorded practice (like many of their other cd-r/cassette releases are), this is a full 53 minutes of instrumental beauty. Warn said "There's a lot of harp on it" when I pressed him for a description, but there's also organs and drums and strings and saxophones. It's mellow, but not boring; it manages to capture the late night smoky feeling of their more recent stuff, though without the R+B influence. In a weird way, it reminds me of the last Coctails album, specifically some of the more pretty instrumental parts. And like the organ piece that ends that record, "Brown Rice" ends with a few minutes of low, pulsing drones. This should be given widespread release, because it's beautiful. [7 December 2003]</p>

Roy Wood's songwriting is also at a peak, and I believe he left after this one to make <i>Boulders</i> and do Wizzard, which is a shame, because this is like the Move's best ideas taken to a further level. The subsequent ELO records that I've heard are all pretty enjoyable but this is the one that most balances the differing predilections of these two songwriters.

<p class="p1">I think <i>Discover America</i> is one of those gems that comes from an artist drastically overreaching. Actually, <i>Song Cycle</i> is more ambitious, being of much larger instrumentation, insanely ambitious lyrics, and the whole all-in mentality to make a great psychedelic orchestral record, which, while it's certainly artistically successful beyond belief, it wasn't really commercially. <i>Discover America</i> changes course, overreaching in the way that Parks incorporates Caribbean and other non-white musical forms into his eclectic vision of American music - and I think every track is a cover, or a reinvention of an existing calpyso tune. There's steel drums galore on this record which is maybe why I like it so much - I love steel drums -  and they make for a different form of psychedelia, one that is as lyrically innovative as anything he ever did. Parks seems to be evaluating the conflicted sense of Americana in the early 70's, with the Vietnam war hanging over everything. Tracks like 'FDR in Trinidad' look at imperialism in a strange, celebratory way and theres a really unique, celebratory manner that makes it very bizarre despite the relative accessibility. Maybe I'm just a Van Dyke fan, I dunno. [28 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a well-regarded relic from the era of British folk-rock, and in many ways Trees are a Fairport Convention knockoff with less fiddles and a bit more hard/country influence (listen to 'Little Sadie', which is practically American in tone, or the crunching 'Streets of Derry'). Despite the lack of originality in style, The Trees are pretty solid, particualrly the middle section of this CD. There's a tendency for noodly, meandering guitar leads that are also somewhat solos, while the band jams along - again, reminiscent of 'A Sailor's Life' by Fairport but with a languid feel and nice haunting reverb on Celia Humphris's voice.  'Murdoch' showcases her pipes most excellently, and the version of 'Sally Free and Easy' is epic, only to be followed by the album's best cuts, 'Fool' and 'Geordie'. I never got their other album but it's also been reissued, and both can be found easily on vinyl now, so I should make the upgrade. [30 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Rose's second LP continues to show his exemplary technique, but features some guest musicians, shorter pieces, and additional instrumentation. The more esoteric influences are thus magnified, and it sounds more like what I thought a solo album from a member of Pelt would sound like. There isn't the same level of sadness that's found on the first one, but it's every bit as mesmerizing. Hopefully Bill's CD release of both albums will bring his music to a much larger audience.

<p class="p1">This should be a real downer trip - songs of the Jewish ghetto, subtitled 'Years of Despair', sung in Yiddish by Sarah Gorby. And while I wouldn't call it upbeat, there's an over-orchestration that takes away from the true misery. Heavily produced music can often amplify misery - Leonard Cohen's <i>Death of a Lady's Man</i> is a good example of that - but here, some of it actually sounds like Shirley Bassey. Even with songs like 'Your Mother Will Not Come Back' and 'Marching Toward Death', I can't get past the big, booming brass. This is packaged quite beautifully with a silkscreened cover and large booklet with lyrical translations in English, and it's a powerful, amazing document if you don't actually listen to the music.

<p class="p1">A new Volcano the Bear album is always a cause for celebration, but especially so with this one. Following the improvisation direction of<i> 500 Boy Piano</i>, the boys have created a record that relies less on vocals and more on instrumental interplay. There's a very pastoral, folky feel, and "Golden Hotbite" might be the most beautiful sounds they have ever put onto record. When the vocals do come in, as they do on the closer "The Mountains Among Us," their impact is grand. I know it's the first record I got this year, but so far it's album of the year.

<p class="p1">When I heard that the Mekons were re-recording their earliest songs, I thought it was a cop-out; a chance to recycle some early work and toss off a record without writing new material. But I'm pleasantly surprised; they've taken these old, anthemic stompers and infused the effects of 25 years of being Mekons into them. Some retain their youthful aggression, and others are arranged in the more recent style, like "What" which has accordion and xylophone. Some sound just like the originals, only recorded clearly and performed with more competence. What's the point? Perhaps it's a moment of self-reflection, like a writer looking back at his past for an autobiography. The blunt title suggests the many contortions of the word "punk" and what has happened in the past 25 years; the music shows that these old geezers from Leeds have retained some bit of their ethos. And while there's only two original members (Jon and Tom of course), the results of the Mekons experiments: failure, warped glory and a glimmer of sunlight through a veneer of cynicism - are evident in all eras of the band, so this ties them together nicely.

<p class="p1">I probably shouldn't have bought this; this is Tim Buckley in his funk/soul style, sounding not unlike Al Green or someone of that ilk; the songwriting and arrangements are very unimaginative, and his voice (while still good) sounds empty. The musicians plod along with funky licks, jazzy riffs, and absolutely no imagination. The only bright moments are the two title tracks, but even these suffer when put up against any of the other records by him. I'm glad he tried different directions, but this work is not for me.

<p class="p1">Buckley's first record is quite good, though he seems to be struggling to find his voice. On much of the record he ambles along like an American Van Morrision; his big, brassy voice is beautiful enough to carry some of the less memorable compositions. The jazzy influences of his mid-period work are absent, with some very baroque, dark pop songs (that remind me of David Ackles) nestled in with some more Burt Bacharachy numbers. "Understand Your Man" hints at the fire to come later, though it's nothing like Lorca. Jack Nitzche did the string arrangements, and Van Dyke Parks plays piano, which I would have never known if I hadn't read the liner notes. While this isn't a masterpiece, it's a very promising debut and hints at the genius to come later. [5 February 2004]</p>

<p class="p1">This is early and good Cabaret Voltaire, a concept album about relgiion with a Christian side and an Islamic side. Lots of this feels at odds with its own tendencies; despite the bang and clatter of the percussion, the soft synth pads seem out of place. The chanted/shouted vocals are of the time, and lend an urgency to songs like 'A Thousand Ways'. This predates Savage Republic, or at least is of the same time, but I feel a real simliarity in this 1980's techno-primitivism. Chris Watson is the interesting figure with Cabaret Voltaire, the Martin Swope of the band, and he delivers some interesting textures on tracks like 'Spread the Virus' and 'Touch of Evil' - and this is the last album with him in the group. The songwriting, while ambitious in scope, is never anything I've clicked with - the production is really the key here. [9 November 2012]</p>

It's a lengthy record, and with different musicians playing on different tracks, it doesn't really gel. But does any Material record really sound like a whole album? Laswell does a good job holding things together, as his bass provides the energy these tracks need to be compelling; but unlike, say, the Massacre album, this leaves more room for detours. There's a lot of synth on it too, but it works pretty well and never overpowers the musicianship. The violing playing is the highlight for me, though I don't know whether it's Bang or Frith.

The booklet that comes with the record notates the melodies and has the lyrics, too, which is a really nice touch. I love Moondog's music so much because it is so open and beautiful - a true reflection of the most wonderful aspects of the natural world.

The album has some really scattered rocking songs, reminding me of the Red Krayola "Wives in Orbit/Yik-Yak" single, only with more wild vocal yelping. There's also some more quiet pieces, with some good attention to detail yet not overdoing it, so the confusion/stupid vibe of the record remains throughout.

The primarily gender/sexuality-themed songs explode from the voice of Vi Subversa, which sounds like a nasty pack of snarling dogs. Her gruff delivery adds to the gender confusion. Musically, her backing band (led by guitarist Richard Famous) relies on jagged, but somewhat dancy rhythms. It's oddly closer to Gang of Four than Crass, though I've never really associated the two bands before. Though it's only EP-length, the record is pretty satisfying. [8 Feb 2005]</p>

The material sounds good, with "Annalise" and "Religion" being especially venmous - there's also a version of "Belsen is a Gas" which makes me wonder if they did other Sex Pistols songs then. PIL is a group who sounds best recorded, so this bootleg is hardly a necessary document of them, but it's a neat curiousity piece for fans (and since I stupidly sold the first album a few years ago, I have some of these songs now).

A rumbling demon haunts this side of the record, more akin to Scott Walker's later work than anything else I could easily compare it to; it perfectly suits Buckley's voice. Side two is a little bit more conventional, but still pretty great - it swings like his last few records but doesn't fall into the soul-rock mire of what came later.

The vocals are sung in English and have a raw 70's feel; it's not a terrible sound at all and one that probably grows with time, though I tend to tune them out and just feel the rhythms building up. It's a very contained style of jamming, often leaving the deep drones to organs or other background instrumentations and letting the guitar drive it; it's not unlike soul music, as these Germans are pretty funky.

The vocals are by Reichel, I guess, though he is only credited with 'echo guitar' and that's certainly what you hear - a sliding and elusive playing that is mind-expanding at times. Reichel's music has something highly futuristic, yet organic - it reminds me a little bit of Magma, but I'm not sure why. I've always thought of this as heavily 'out' music, but its direct and accessible. The second side has a cleaner guitar tone, but it's stopp loopy and layered, with the recorder and bass-recorder floating all over the place. The intersections of the hard and soft melodic lines makes a latticework of sound here, which actually is a similar feeling that a lot of late 90s/early 00s "post-rock" does. And this is cleary pre-post rock anyway. [12 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">This oft-forgotten VtB release is material from their earliest recordings, and it displays a much more ramshackle band trying to find their voice.  The low-fi recording quality is really extreme on this record - sibilance just rolls off the surface of the vinyl and it caused me to actually adjust my treble EQ to make it more listenable.  Behind all the tape hiss is a mess of collages, weird voices, and acoustic instruments lunged at primitively.  The second side has some repetetive rock band moments, though much closer to a weird lounge/jazz band than the This Heat-isms of their later work.  Overall this is a million miles away from the concentrated, focused efforts heard on records like <i>The Idea of Wood</i>, yet I enjoyed this far more than I remembered.  [17 Feb 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">A new Mountain Goats album, and one produced by John Vanderslice. And what production it is - lush, but not overly done, with arrangements that perfectly suit Darnielle's tunes. The single, "Palmcorder Yajna", is a glorious tune that's driven by a straight, driving beat. I listened to it a million times this summer. The rest of the album continues the same themes he's written about in 3,000 other songs, only with a bit more energy. I think it's a definite improvement over "Talahassee," showing that he is finding his groove in the big studio/4AD scene and continuing to do what he does best, with little variation. The final track, "Pigs That Ran..." is sure to be an anthemic live number for years to come. Keep pumping it out Darnielle, cause I'll keep sucking it up. [22 Jan 2005]</p>

There's a tendency towards space that I really appreciate, and some of the melodies are familiar from the live lineup I saw last summer. Agent Preest picked this as his album of the year, and while I probably wouldn't go that far I think it's a good step for Daniel and I'm excited to hear what comes next. [22 Jan 2005]</p>

There's a lot of vocals on the <i>King Oedipus </i>material which is split over two discs, and sometimes I long for the more resonant clanging of <i>Delusion of the Fury</i> - but this is still groundbreaking, original American music. I feel very inspired by Partch, even though there's not a ton here that I connect to on an emotional level, more because I feel this is such uniquely uncompromising work that manages to push forth the definition of music while simultaneously being expressive, personal, and wonderful to bathe the ears in.

<p class="p1">Two Nagoski compositions, released in 2003. 'Effortless Battle' is a half-hour work of very bassy drones, the kind that actually rattle windows when being listened to. I can only imagine how great this low end would sound on vinyl. This is a piece that would actually probably irritate my neighbours, if I had any. As it builds, higher tones come in that swirl and swirl, becoming quite beuatiful, if disorientating. 'Ripped Steam Hinterland' fills out the disc, 15 minutes of subtly changing drone played on one of Dan Conrad's homemade instruments, though if you told me it was just general oscillators, I wouldn't really know the difference. It's been 9 years probably since I last listened to this, since I rarely listen to minimal and droney stuff, but I should more because this is impressive. [14 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is buried among the zillion releases Spencer emitted around this time, but it's actually a pretty important one, as it presents a series of live BxC performances over a 5 year period in Cincinnati. The liner notes are quite clear in spelling out background information about the performers and venues, and it makes me a bit sad cause I'm nostalgic for this more simple time (even though I was a few hours away only following Spencer's work through occasional visits). The 1999 recordings are the most interesting to hear now, as they show a rambunctious electronic/computer side that seems miles away from what was to follow. The band with Lesniak and Rich in 2002 (opening up for Arco Flute Foundation, Keenan Lawler and Charalambides, oh my!) is about the time that I checked in to the CSY/BxC story. And then, things gel on the second tape with Robert, Trevor and Mike Shiflet being part of BxC, though to be honest, which is continued (and all together as a quartet) on some further releases. The electronic-drenched crescendos are often blistering, with howling vocal outbursts and percussion struggling to hold it all together. The crowd noise, often indicating just how small these crowds are, adds to everything -- and there's a real curiosity at play for both artists and listener. [31 December 2012]</p>

In some ways, this is an exploration of what the two could do upon a first meeting. Alex sticks primarily to percussion and Richard layers on electronics, keyboards, and everything else. Alex rides the toms which are recorded with some reverb yet still sound tinny at points, and the smooth waves of synth that ride over top, especially on the lengthy 'Mexico', are supported by thick, psychedelic layers and with their voices that work together well. 'God Bless the Master' is a traditional song that comes out of 'Mexico's ambience and brings their interest in folk to a beautiful summation. [28 December 2012]</p>

I think this is Phil and Chris Hladowski. The opening track sounds like it - it's a harmonium or organ drone over which a solo instrument, possibly Chris's bouzouki, amplified, noodles around. Dark psych, indeed, from some dark psyches. 'Pitch! Beat Box Two' is built over a rhythm loop, a bit of a groovy jam but slightly nervous the whole time. The two show a real balance of playing off each other, which gets bluesy at points but stays focused.This melodic noodling continues into the fourth track, but it's a nice change from the usual onslaught of static, dirt and noise that is Ashtray Navigations.

<p class="p1">It's been six months since I last bought a record. What is out there that could make me break from this self-imposed celibacy? Anyone who knows me knows how important this album is to me, and the promise of an extra CD of bonus tracks was too much too pass up. Sure, I already own the Castle reissue which has most of discs 1 and 2, but the lure of disc 3 (and low price) made me buy it. But in looking through the sleeve notes, the first two discs have a few gems I didn't previously own, even if it's as minor as the mono mix of "Berkeley Mews". Speaking of which, "Berkeley Mews" is now linked to this album so I can sing that too on road trips. But disc 3 - the reason for buying this - does not disappoint. As early as track 2, the brilliant (and unheard) "Misty Water" - I am a happy man. "Lavender Hill" and "Where Did my Spring Go?" are also completely incredible - and now I will always wonder how I ever truly loved this album before this reissue. [14 August 2004]</p>

Irene's side is actually Auk Theatre, the dentist piece I saw so many times back when we lived together. It's a great work of visual theatre but it also translates to the audio-only realm well, mostly because of the time and care Irene put into the soundtrack.

<p class="p1"><i>Bee Thousand</i> is one of the greatest records in my life, and certainly my late-adolecence; at the period they made it, Pollard and GbV were at an absolutely brilliant pinnacle, where they just continually manufactured genius tune after genius tune. This collection puts it all together, and while at first listen I was a bit bummed, I just realized that the sequence is completely part of the brilliance of this album. Here in a new form, it's something else - a longer glimpse into Pollard's mind at the time. There's a good mix of old EP/B-side tracks and unreleased songs (or songs at least new to me). Most are worthwhile, and it's great to have gems like "Indian Was an Angel" on vinyl finally, as well as "Postal Blowfish," "Break Even," and "Do the Earth". I feel that the two finest records of my indie rock upbringing, Slanted and Enchanted and Bee Thousand, now have been given the expanded reissues they deserve.

It becomes quite heavy at some points, and in a very Scandinavian way the music remains somber at all times. I can't really think of anything to compare this to, though it might appeal to fans of Labradford and early Kranky roster material. [27 Mar 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">Irene presents four tracks, one solo and 3 of assorted projects. "For the Neonate" is a work of musique concrete featuring Irene's creepy voice and some beluga whale calls. "De Mo" is an Ergo Phizmiz piece using Irene's source material, and it works in a beat-oriented motif while sounding really fucked up and weird. The Sick Hour track is the most fucked up sounding piece on here, and one of the most unusual recordings I've heard from any of the participants. The Auk track works well with the whole, though I do miss the visuals. Overall this is probably the best work Irene has ever done, and I hope it gets heard by the audience it deserves.

The two sides compliment each other well and I wouldn't doubt that they were actually the work of one person if told that. [16 Mar 2005]</p>

Ron made this in 2001 and I got a copy just around the time I was first getting to know Spencer; apparently, the German label Zarek was as impressed as I was and they decided to reissue it just a few years later. <i>Quatervois</i> is an incredible work of solo electronics, and it's been a long time since I've listened to it, and it was nothing like I remembered. I remembered slow, expanding deep drones in a <i>Soliloquy for Lilith</i> way, but instead it's a much more varied bit of rumbling, static, and carefully compiled layers of his and oscillators. The third track has a subterranean rhythm that is built around a Linn Drum Machine, but completely subverts the machine's capabilities. Track 4 explicitly uses morse code transmissions, and the final track works with machine guns from Fort Knox. It's much closer to the deep listening sound art of Lee Patterson of what Luke's mostly into, than Spencer's brand of chaos and juxtaposition. I wonder what Ron has been doing - it's been ages since I've seen him and I hope he is still making great work. [29 July 2012]</p>

I never got much from Nautical Almanac and even met the guy once and barely remember him, but this release blew my mind when I picked it up. But this release has so much personality - it actually achieves a level of human expression through the most abrasive sounds possible, and it does this through a mastery of construction and form. The second side is full of weird locked grooves and bizarre mastering techniques and my copy is even a bit warped, but it doesn't make a lick of difference because there's so much energy and emotion here that it transcends mere pitch differences. I also have volume 2 which I don't know as intimately, and I see there's a volume 3 which I might have to track down. I'd file this alongside John Wiese's <i>Soft Punk </i>for something that I'd have to label as 'noise' but is so accomplished and transcendant that there's really not much else I can even say here.

<p class="p1">You can trust Kyle Lapidus to release the weirdest of the weird. The brilliantly named MC Trachiotomy actually does resemble hip-hop in a small way, though not in a way that's likely to make them fans in that scene. The side-long exploration of voice and rhythm (that's the best term I can come up with) begins sounding like Dr. John growling cajun syllables through a bit of waxed paper, over which a rhythmic beat threatens to rip itself apart continually. It gets weirder as it goes along, and it's chaotic without being abrasive or noisy, thus making it a genuinely fascinating listen. I tune out the words, which are more a percussive element, though there is definite hip-hop intonations at play. Ending on a locked groove, it rewards those with short attention spans. Occasional Detroit, on the flip, is a different beast entirely. It's as much of a deconstruction of techno and dance music as MC Trachiotomy was to rap; it's skittery, breakcore-style beats come in light flurries, and the futurist textures assemble into a barrage of (somewhat irritating) acts of aggression.

I used to own this on CD which had the whole thing sequenced as 1 or 2 tracks, so you can't skip around to the bits you like, which is precisely the way it should be done. On vinyl you have a bit more freedom to pick and choose but this is famous for it's collage-like nature, so it's most enjoyable as one big trip. The real reason this should be so acclaimed is not because it's a big collage, but because it's so awesome - the entirety of it is really, really strong, whether it's a free jazz freakout, dark psych-folk song, or experimental reverb-laden moanfest. There are actually far more splices than crossfades here, and the fragments are all brilliant as compositions alone. I wonder how much editing was at work here - if this is really the best 40 minutes out of hundreds of hours, or if all the jams being made at this time were so strong. [10 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">After being apart from the majority of my record collection for over 3 years, it's great to be reunited.  Of course I didn't have a turntable the first two weeks, so it was especially painful to just look at all of these records.  Now I've got a cheap one so I can start listening again.  I'm pulling these records out pretty much at random and listening through the plastic crappyness of this turntable (which is just to tide me over til I can afford a decent audiophile one) but even then this record just sounds amazing.  Since I first heard this (after trying to track it down for months in the pre-Internet days, where I was trying to get a CD for less than $30 on eBay ... oh how times have changed) I've of course heard a million things influenced by it.  I've heard a zillion pastichy psychedelic jam bands and weird surrealist audio-collage specialists, and of course a zillion Velvets/punk-influenced primitives, but nothing seems to do it all as well as this.  And sitting with my head right between the speakers, I get the full impact of the crazy bending guitars and bubbling electronics.  It's not that this is the most far out and NWWlisty record ever - rather, it's accessible and direct, somewhat 'straight-forward' compared to something like, I dunno, Brainticket -- but it's satisfying and eye-opening because of this. And though this is a Recommended reissue from '79 (I think) it keeps the beautful packaging of the original - tight black wrap with lovely screenprints for each track.  Why am I sitting here importing old spreadsheet data when I should be calling people and getting my own Faust together?  [12 Dec 2008]</p>

This might be the first release with Don Moye on it, and while it definitely it somewhat more "traditional" than their other records, it's still incredible. Over four long pieces (one of them traversing three sides), they use their new drummer to his fullest potential. With the rhythm duties thus freed up, the other members are able to really tear it up on their instruments. Some moments are absolutely beautiful, even conventionally so; others are quite challenging. [19 May 2005]</p>

The instrumental work is recorded much more clearly than <i>Trout Mask</i> and it's easier to tell what's going on (but it doesn't make any more sense).

It's one of their first sessions with Don Moye as a full member, and it stands alone among their entire catalog for its diversity and accessibility. The opening cut, 'Theme de Yo Yo', is an all-time soul great driven by Bass's great voice and the catchy melody. Yet it's the middle section of the album that is so remarkable - a series of slow, almost neo-classical explorations where Bass is silent (or on piano) and the abstractions of their Paris work find a resonance in the canon of Western music. Monteverdi is tackled here, split over two sides, and done fairly straight and then with a jazz swing on the other side. Bass reappears for the ending cut, by which point there's a new hybrid genre of great black music being made. Absolutely singular. [25 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This live recording from the Ann Arbour Blues Festival in 1972 (which my father may have attended, though he can't remember which year and certainly doesn't remember seeing this) begins with a crazy tribal percussion jam before blending into a Malachi Favors-penned vocal melée. Roscoe Mitchell's compositions in the middle of this record pull things back towards the direction of brassy jazz, though they're in his usual style, which is open, non-visceral, and subversive. 'Oouffnoon' gets into some madcap free squealing over Moye's spazzy percussion work, so there is some sense that they gave the crowd what they wanted. Much of side two is taken up by a long Joseph Jarman composition that actually feels cathartic after the experiments of the record so far - the band actually plays together in a swinging, jazz fashion, though it's aggressive and quite driven by Favors and Moye. Bowie lets it rip here, almost like he's been holding back his vibrating exaltations until now. This turn towards the inside continues on their rendering of 'Odwalla', a beautiful transition to sweetness, still with a rolling swing, that ends this set. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

The rest of the record is written by Roscoe Mitchell, though the majority of it sounds collectively improvised.

<p class="p1">Listening to Albert Ayler makes me feel completely amazing. The way that this set opens, with 'Bells', just instantly fills me with a sense of goodness, wonder and magic. It's easy to be hyperbolic about music but this type of musical expression is still incredible to me after years of listening. This is that band with Don Ayler and Michael Sampson, similar to what's on the Impulse 2xCD, and probably my pick of Ayler's lineups. I'm a sucker for the violin and for Don Ayler's somewhat crude (yet perfect) trumpet lines. Maybe I'm influenced by all the religious imagery in the song titles and whatnot, but I do find this to be a form of religion as a listener; the great church of Ayler. Side 3 has an extended take on 'Ghosts', titled in the singular here, where things get really distant and deconstructed, almost as if he's tired of his signature tune, but I welcome the workout.. The more discordant bits, like 'Jesus' and the variations on 'Ghosts' are perfect when juxtaposed with the warm, wide trumpet/sax interplay which I completely want to bathe myself in. I think the Lörrach sessions (the first LP) are slightly more exuberant (and better recorded) than the Paris ones but it's all good. [28 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Ayler's first record I think? This is far from the visceral blasts of his ESP records, but still showing a bold, innovative young saxophonist. Recorded in Europe, the music moves similarly to the first few Ornette Coleman records. Ayler's tone is a bit glassier here than we're used to, though it still shakes all over the place. The longer piece on side two breaks away the most and certainly classifies this record as "free jazz," though it was probably mostly ignored upon it's release. The title is appropriate though, because this is certainly an announcement that Ayler has arrived. [22 May 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I think this is the only LP I have on the great Shandar label, a French imprint that released a bunch of epic free jazz and some LaMonte Young stuff. This is volume 1 in a two-LP live set, wonderfully recorded in 1970, and super energetic. This set focuses on the more melodic side of Ayler, with a beautiful version of 'Spirits' driven by Cal Cobbs' piano and Allen Blairman taking charge with an extended drum solo. This French rhythm section - also with Steve Tintweiss on bass - roots Ayler in a more fluid sound than he would have with Sunny Murray and/or Henry Grimes in place. Cobbs's piano licks are occasionally vaudevillian, and it's a bright star in the Ayler catalog, despite not really being indicative of Ayler's sound. The lack of Don's trumpet leaves Albert as the only real bass, apart from Mary Maria's soprano which isn't even that active. The vibrato is at times almost conventional, but when he digs in, as on 'Holy Family', it really rips. A great record, sure, but it's not 100% the Ayler we want - even his early 60's stuff, while far less adventurous, has more of an edge - but this is the direction Ayler went towards in his last years, and maybe this is a great point before it descended into fusion-rock.

<p class="p1">A "studio" Ayler record, and it's nice because we can actually hear Sunny Murray get the drum mics he deserves. Though I still can't help the feeling he's underrepresented on this record, as on all of his Ayler appearances - perhaps that's the way that Ayler wanted it? The mix is a bit weird, panning the brass into one channel and the rhythm section into another, but the performance is crisp (though I think I prefer the energy that is enhanced by having an audience in front of them). The trumpet player is nice and underrated, though he's no Don Ayler. [31 July 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">Two titans of the AACM meet in this mid-70's outing, which has a fantastic African-influenced cover but sadly no credits as to who is playing what.  I think the piano is probably Braxton and the reeds/flute is Jarman.  The labels are wrong so side 2 which says side 1 on the label begins the album with 'Together Alone', which is two saxophones playing simultaneously the same slow melodic line.  The second track is a longer, sparse improvisation with Jellyroll-style piano twinkles and Jarman squeezing the life out of a flute.  It keeps expanding and contracting, occasionally with one player dropping out to let the other start some sort of melodic theme, but it never gels (which is intentional).  At the end it explodes in a cacophony of bells, whistles, toys, and dual-tracked spoken vocals.  It's pretty great, actually.  The other side is two Braxton compositions (you can tell cause the titles are cryptic gibberish) and it opens with a dirty sax honk and what actually sounds like a gurgling Moog or something.  Througout the piece they keep jumping around on different instruments, sounding like they're in a big room and having fun.  They step into sync a bit though, true to the title of the record, with some slow, stepping harmonies - someone is playing two things at once at points, unless there is overdubbing.  Somewhere along the line the second track started.  The side ends in a dirgy sax line with rustling bells, and it's lovely.  Overall the album has a very playful feel, yet mature rather than balls-out.  It's an obscure one but one to cherish.  [2 Jan 2009]</p>

The guitars still do some interesting things but the rhythm section plugs along like ZZ Top or something. Some good songs like "Big Eyed Beans from Venus" are here, but a lot of the record is full of weird, soft-rock leaning material, which isn't terrible per se, but just not what I want in a Beefheart record. You can hear his push towards commercial music here, which hit rock bottom with the next two, I guess. [31 July 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a rarely-talked about group of European musicians, mostly Dutch I think, that made a great record here of collectively improvised music. It's from the jazz idiom for sure - there's sax and trumpet and spazzy jazzdrumming and Erwin Somer's xylophone (or vibes, can't really tell) which is a great balance to the skronkyness. The whole thing begins so slowly, with Ferdy Rikkers' bowing some bass very slowly, and it frequently settles down to let musicians paint more delicately. Some of the percussion/xylophone interplay is almost silly, such a contrast to the more growling furious moments. Sometimes I wonder why I need to own so many distinct free jazz records, especially as they are focused on such a short period of time, but they really do all have their distinct personalities. This one has a far more Euro flavour than any of the NYC or Chicago scene people of the time, and also a more exuberant continental feel compared to Derek Bailey or Spontaneous Music Ensemble or Evan Parker, which while brilliant, has a more dry edge.

My mistake - this is an incredible recording, collecting a ton of different songs from various nomadic people across the country, all recorded around 1970. Actually, it's only the first side that has nomadic gypsy songs, and side two is music of settled gypsies, but I didn't detect too much of a difference. Most of the songs are all vocal, with some tapping or handclaps, and a few of them had insane, crazy vocals that I've never really heard before. When there are strings or drums it's also pretty good, as the recording quality is pretty bad (or maybe the instruments are just really shitty) so everything has that classic field recording sense. Some of the vocals sound so casual - just muttering at times - which I loved because it seems so natural. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

Some parts pick up a bit, approaching the style of someone like Area, only rather second rate. There's one part with vocals that is sorta funny.

This set is fantastic - the standout being side 1, with the droney, low-key second track and "Dedicated to Poets and Writers" which is a fucking string quartet composed by Coleman that sounds so intense. This is also 1962 we're talking about - the longer free piece on side two isn't the most interesting thing I've ever heard, but for it's time it's very forward things and Izenzon (one of my favorite jazz bassists ever) is worth hearing no matter what he's doing.

Her voice is absolutely perfect - I think I may prefer it above anyone else's - and she brings a weight to the material that seems natural, in no way overdramatic. I've been enjoying it since I copied it from Alex last summer, but to have a copy now on vinyl is really a treat because it sounds even better. [12 May 2005]  Gave this a random spin on this October morning and it was lovely, as always.  Tabor has a deep, European huskyness to her voice and it really drives the a capella songs - 'The Band Played Waltzing Matilda' is pretty epic, and the slight hesitations and tempo changes she can do on those pure vocal songs is great.  When there's accompanyment I like it too - Nic Jones does some lovely fingerpicking and I like the piano on side two.  They aren't all old traditionals - there's a few more recently composed songs here which are also lovely.  [1 October 2011]</p>

This one features a solo track by each member, and Peter Christopherson's solo piece, 'Valley of the Shadow of Death', is a masterful tape piece that mixes low-level speech and other sounds into something truly fascinating. The band isn't particularly song-orientated here, though Genesis P-Orridge's pop fetish comes out slightly in 'Weeping'. Other highlights include 'Hometime' which has a recording of a child's voice of an eerie, creeping guitar figure, the chaotic madness of 'Hit By a Rock', and the discord of 'Blood on the Floor'. But generally, <i>D.o.A</i> is a relatively restrained record, with an attention to construction/detail that is masterful.

The fuller group pieces are always abstract, even as Richard Abrams piano tries to inflect some tradition into the works. Side four ends with a flutterly loop of screaming horns that is thick but headache-inducing. I hope these comments aren't taken negatively, as Mitchell is a very talented composer and performer, and this record shows his strengths. It's just an intense listen, that's all. [31 July 2005]</p>

There's some awesome stuff - the profanity-laced tirade at the end of 'Marches', the vaguely Art Bears-esque 'The Milkmaid', and the pure ideological history of 'Plekhanov'. The band is actually fairly competent, though clearly still second fiddle to the message, and sometimes you think Mayo is just goofing on it all. 'If She Loves You' closes the record with a rumination on the fleeting nature of romance, a theme also present in the oddly-titled (or is it?) 'The Principles of Party Organisation' ; and odd to share vinyl space wit a song called 'The Mistakes of Trotsky', but odd is the name of the game. The biggest Art and Language/Red Crayola "hit" on <i>Corrected Slogans</i>, 'Keep All Your Friends', appears here in a revamped version that's really anthemic but I still prefer the original falling-apart one.

This pre-Art Ensemble AACM stuff is so exciting because you can just hear the musicians being pulled into a million different directions, not focusing as much as the later material but yet still completely innovative and brilliant. Some groups are the sum of their parts - and this record combined with solo Joseph Jarman may equal the Art Ensemble in personnel, but the sum is greater than the parts (though this one is fantastic).

<p class="p1">Sunny Murray might be the most odd drummer in the whole free jazz canon. He seems at times to be denying the essential rhythm of an improvisation, or at least spreading the pulse out in a wide net. His style, particularly on this record, is so far removed from the jazz traditions, but then the rest of the band is so jazzy that it's really a mishmash. Jacques Coursil dominates here; his trumpet playing is freakish at times, smooth at others. His own composition, 'Angels and Devils', resembles Ayler only in title but instead of being an expressive, direct lyrical statement, it veers all over the course. His playing on 'Giblet' is the perfect complement to Murray's ebb and flow, which is actually remarkable. At times Murray just fixated on the snare drum, hitting it so monotonously it loses any sense of syncopation, while the cymbal crashes continue. The recording quality isn't great here, which adds to the mystique of this. This copy is an original ESP with paste-on back cover and text in Esperanto; it musta seemed like a transmission from another planet in 1966. [31 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Roscoe Mitchell delivers another left-field deconstruction of jazz here, though this lacks the warm fluidity of <i>Sound</i>, instead creating a cold and distant feeling. The opener, 'Tnoona', I'm pretty sure is also on <i>Fanfare for the Warriors, </i>but here is built around Muhal Richard Abrams circular piano figure. It's a brilliant direction for jazz-like music that feels underexplored, and the remainder the album is such a different tone that it can't help but disappoint me. George Lewis is a great trombonist and I don't have enough of his recordings; his composition is similar to the two of Mitchell's on the flipside, suggesting this quartet was much  more than an Art Ensemble diversion. The sense of space that I always love about Mitchell's work (and AACM in general) is never threatened - for much of the record, the musicians never play together, instead negotiating a dialogue. Spencer Barefield's guitar is the a highlight, as he's not well known and there's rarely guitar involved in AACM recordings. This is for a specific mood, which is that of tense, yet gentle explorations; I'm glad to have it for when I feel that way. [23 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This may be the strangest Pere Ubu record, no doubt due to the presence of Mayo Thompson in the lineup. The more aggressive residue from the Peter Laughner days is mostly missing here, and the new direction has almost a cabaret feel, although falling apart. Lyrically, Thomas is cryptic and side two is a total bad trip, though a cover of "Horses" from the solo Mayo record picks up the pace before "Crush that Horn," which is the most fucked up and experimental Pere Ubu piece that I have ever heard.

<p class="p1">Shel Talmy made this Jansch record, perhaps a partial stab at crossover success as it features a full band on some tracks, with flute/sax, and rolling drumbeat (somewhat more rigid than Pentangle's jazzercise, though it is Danny Thompson on bass). It's also a bit of a stab at garnering sympathy for his loneliness, as the lyrical theme throughout is downbeat blues and mourning. The placid instrumentals are nice against the swinging vocal pieces, 'I've Got a Woman' being a nice example of such, with Jansch really letting loose vocally, almost like Tim Buckley or something. When he steps on the gas and digs in, it's quite driving, thanks again to a solid band -- but it always stays acoustic, god forbid. [27 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This record is a great collaboration - the Eastern-influenced downer folk of Areski and Fontaine, but with the Art Ensemble of Chicago as a backing band on some tracks. It's not a total synthesis of minds and spirits - the Art Ensemble are just session musicians at points, and there are only a few really jammy places where we see an early glimpse into the free/folk sound that became so commonplace a few years ago. No one is interested in dazzling the others; there's a pretty cohesive group feel to these musical segments, indicating that this collaboration could have lasted and become something great. I guess the Art Ensemble were really open during their Paris residency - every bit of tape they touched during 1969 is remarkble. [24 August 2012]</p>

I am totally fascinated by the South African jazz musicians that emigrated to England in the late 60's but I've never heard any of the groups beyond the Brotherhood of Breath. Mongezi Feza and some others are present here, though it's not nearly as melodically focused. Far from being a free for-all, these avant-jazz sessions definitely have the same bright energy that I associate with Fezi, though a bit more meandering and free. The b-side has a lot of spoken stuff which works pretty well in the context. Now, what else is there to find? [17 Mar 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I bought this simple because it looked bizarre and had quotes from Ron and Russel Mael on the back cover - funny quotes too, for while they are attempting to push the record, they admit to not having heard it. According to the Internet, Gleaming Spires were Sparks' rhythm section in the early 80's. Their debt to Sparks is pretty vast - they both employ catch melodies, lots of synth, and clever/quirky lyrics. Nothing here approaches the brilliance of Sparks' best work, but there are some definite gems. Their one hit was "Are You Ready for the Sex Girls?" which is a really ridiculous song, but good. The closer, "Big Hotels" is akin to Ron Mael's best moments. Some songs like "How To Get Girls Through Hypnotism" are good, but too long. [24 Mar 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I bought this pretty much randomly because I liked the cover, and Ross didn't remember anything about it. Michel Dintrich is an experimental guitar player who works without any alteration. Side 1 is an entirely acoustic suite that is very sparse and slow-moving, opening up like gagaku in the beginning. The approach is completely without reference to tradition or genre, and it reminds me of Steffen Basho-Junghans in that aspect. Side two is a piece composed with tape using Dintrich's guitar playing (I think) that reminded me of George Crumb in it's imagery. There is still a largely acoustic basis to this though it's much more layered. Overall, a very nice find. [17 Mar 2005]</p>

We get Cherry doing a bit of the 'Si Te Ra Ma' song that's on <i>Orient</i>, and then the big 'Humus' and 'Actions' pieces, which actually properly explore the possibility of free jazz + orchestra. Cherry's 'Humus' is built around a strong melodic riff, a bit like his Blue Note albums. The orchestra goes wild but it's all kept under control; Cherry's spoken introduction is charming too. I rarely pull this one out when in the Don Cherry mood, but I should more often cause it's epic. [2 November 2012]</p>

Today it sounds so tame, especially after seeing the Brotzmann Tentet last night. What sounded so extreme and dissonant back then sounds very accessible here, just like a slight deconstruction of bebop. Coleman's sax is really the weird thing here, because the rest of the band sounds music more traditional, even though I realize they are breaking away from chordal/modal foundations. Some things still sound groundbreaking many years later, and some attain a subtlety over the years. This falls into the latter, for sure. [12 May 2005]</p>

It's very cold music (despite the title) but I wonder if I just have different expectations from Julie Tippetts. It's certainly closer to Spontaneous Music Ensemble. Her vocals are wordless, moaning in a manner akin to those early Gunter Hampel records, but perhaps brighter. [23 May 2005]  Gave this a random go tonight, and yeah, it's a difficult one, but the real problem is Colin McKenzie's electric bass, which feels more like the slap happy style that often plagues fusion improv. But there's some great moments here, particularly when Keith Tippett is present - his piano is really full and flowing, and it works well with Julie Tippett's sliding vocal energy. Watts's sax style is really precise and tight, and while it's not a tone I love, it's a good balance to the Tippetts. I'm gonna keep this record at least til the next listen, which might be another 7 years from now. [3 April 2012]</p>

The arrangements have no trace of the ragged honesty found in his 60s work, but they are certainly nice in their own. The instrumental guitar pieces on each side are absolutely beautiful and recorded with a warm intimate charm. Said charm extends to songs like 'Stone Monkey', a straight-up country rock vibe that isn't evident in his earlier work. Jansch works well here - the Los Angeles of the album title must have infused his songwriting with that West Coast Byrdsyness, and I welcome it. There's a redux of 'Needle of Death' here, with some strings in the background that are surprisingly unobtrusive - the slower version has more gravitas, though I still prefer the original.

<p class="p1">Is this the only Sun Ra record on ESP besides the <i>Heliocentric Worlds</i>? I think the free jazz reputation of Sun Ra is largely founded upon this record, which has some extremely exploratory freakouts; however the many other sides of Sun Ra are also present. You get bluesy piano, soulful balladry, and some repetitive pre-funk jamming that reminds me of the <i>Ethiopiques</i> stuff more than Fletcher Henderson. With so many Sun Ra records out there it's hard to pick a favorite but this is certainly one of the best, and a good place to start. [23 July 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I've always slightly preferred Joseph Jarman's compositions to Roscoe Mitchell's (though of course they create something magical together) because his work feels more natural and expressive than Mitchell's, which is often overly cerebral. This solo outing (which features Fred Anderson and Steve McCall) is definitely a precursor to Art Ensemble. The first side explodes with flurries of notes and all of the musicians playing their hearts out. "Adam's Rib" features some interesting contrapuntal playing between Jarman and Charles Clark, sounding like a Max/MSP patch to me at times. The title track closes the record, and it develops very slowly, with lots of space - a definite antecedent of what made the Art Ensemble so unique. The inevitable eruptions are as much menacing as celebratory, with some controlled harmonies that make this seem more like a modern classical composition than a "jazz" one. [20 Mar 2005]</p>

Actually, I was thinking about what records would be the worst possible choices to set a seductive mood and this would have to be up there. Lacy actually plays kinda sexy at points - there's a real straight-ahead melodicism to his soprano thrusts - but then he's capable of bending the notes into the bizarro zone. There are warbles, hesitations, and outright screeches at times, all presented as a logical step in the modification of a sound. He uses a radio on a few tracks for either background content or static, a nice effect of randomness on solo improvisation. This is not 100% improvisation - there are distinct songs throughout - but the balance is just. [8 November 2012]</p>

There are a couple of parts where the electronic vocal affectation lurch out in a really jarring way. Other tracks are more standard jazz-rock, and not that memorable but I haven't listened enough for the lyrics to sink or anything.

The first LP is all over the place, with some very dark instrumental jams and other song-oriented stuff.

<p class="p1">This is a mid-70s Impulse! reissue of the Sun Ra classic from the late 50's. Sun Ra's band is smaller here, and much more obviously descended from Fletcher Henderson's band. The songs come out of a midcentury Chicago swing background, with Sun Ra's piano holding the centre and letting the saxes and trumpets swing around. John Gilmore gets special billing in the subtitle and indeed his tenor has a brassy swagger that clearly dictates he is to be top dog (though Pat Patrick's baritone challenges at times). There's little space exploration to be done here, though 'Ancient Ethiopia' does have an unusual chordal progression with an African theme. Fun, jaunty numbers like 'Images' follow a standard bop pattern, with places for solos, and nice interplays between various band members. A great, landmark recording of American jazz, even though it only hints at the crazyness to follow. [24 July 2012]</p>

The Burning Star Core approach is to add layers to it all, which I guess is violin and electronics throughout. It's integrated quite into the mix, sounding like a cohesive band or maybe they just put everything through the same amps. It's hard to really get the clarity against the chaos; this distinction I tend to enjoy from the Robert/Spencer jams and with Comets on Fire thrashing about behind them, the only thing is to let go and ride along.

'How I spent the middle part of the 00s' is summed up by a few recordings, especially this one, though I don't play on it or anything like that -- it's made by close friends at a time when I was quite involved with things, and came out when I lived in Lexington, and this was the very heart of my world. I've always thought of this as the single best Burning Star Core release -- it's the one I recommended to Evan Parker -- but maybe I disagree now. It hasn't lost any of its magic - this is a perfect document of all the things that Burning Star Core was and could be from 2002-2004, and even has a nice balance between Spencer solo ('Benjamin'), Spencer with Cinci dudes (Lesniak's electronics on 'Nyarlathotep' make the piece, and it's also a nice early vocal recording) and the Lex crew -- plus, this features the great Jim McIntyre of Von Hemmling infamy. The recording quality is stellar and the mastering is also great - these Thin Wrist LPs are such lovely packages. Trevor's trumpet playing on 'Catapults' is really brilliant and Robert sort of steals the show on side two. A sense of balance and willingness to share the spotlight is why this feels so balanced, I guess. [14 August 2012]</p>

It's one I liked when I first heard it years ago, and i's great to finally track a copy down. The first track has some really goofy spoken stuff and a fucked up moog part; side two is one long jam that has no builds, no momentum, and nothing but the weird drugged out vibe that these south islanders do the best. Siltbreeze was really something else in the mid-90's. [26 April 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">A two-song 12" by the Ex from the early 90s, around their peak period when they were hanging out with Tom Cora and making <i>Joggers and Smoggers</i>. This comes with three pages of angry rants about how evil the Schengen agreement is, which is kind of funny to read now, and I wonder if they still feel such vitriol against the unified Europe (probably). 'Euroconfusion' is punchy, and a bit funky; 'Bird in the Hand' has more shard-like guitar clatter and some explosive sounds. When it slows down, the fury subsides, but only for a second. This probably could have been a 7" but then there would be less packaging on which they could put angry rants about Schengen, and the half-engraved side B wouldn't be there which is fucking lovely.

This has probably the single best take on 'Power' that the Dead C ever did, and they certainly released enough versions; 'Sky' likewise slays. But the opening cut ('Sunshine') and the weird German-titled song at the end are what really bridges this from being just a typical document of the band at the peak of their powers. It makes this a more complete picture, showing the pure free improvisatory direction they were going in while still being rooted to these amazing, amazing songs. And it's not even a real live album!

The photographs are stunning; it's a remarkable bit of history and there's no more appropriate band to contemporize history than the Ex, who for all of their anti-power hysterics, are stridently intelligent.

<p class="p1">The Ex's third album has a lot of scraping guitars and pounding drumbeats, over which G. W. Sok does his 'Ex' thing. I'm a definite Ex fan though this doesn't have as many memorable tracks on it. It's right before they made <i>Blueprints for a Blackout</i>, which I always thought was their first foray towards experimental music, though you can really hear it starting here, where they start to open up songs and pick them apart. Most of the lyrics are along the intent of 'Squat!', though often an observational tendency that is actually quite memorable. 'F.U.N.E.I.D.Y' gets into almost romantic territory, or maybe it's just addressing desire through an anarchist perspective, who knows. The recording is solid, and Terrie's guitar cuts through everything. 'O.S.L.' actually has some synth drums or triggers or something, which brings an industrial flavour that actually suits the Ex. Solid, but since I listen to them so rarely today, I'm much more likely to pull out <i>Joggers and Smoggers </i>or the two with Tom Cora when I'n in the mood. [1 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The Ex and many guests conspire to make this massive, sprawling double LP, which has always been my pick of the Ex's discography even though I find it too dense and intimidating to get though in one listen. There's a lot of stuff happening here - a lot of 80's style fast start-stop shuffling Ex songs with G.W. Sok ranting, but also a lot of loose improvised bits, including some stuff that is practically ambient in nature. The Ex have such an apocalyptic feel to them and the improvisations carry that on. It's a very long record - so long that I have trouble concentrating on it, though I find it completely impressive as an achievement. 'Brickbat' has to be a tribute to Beefheart as it's among the most abstract lyrics the Ex has ever laid down; Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore appear here too, as well as a bunch of great Dutch improv guys like Ab Baars. I always admire artists who stay true to some ideals and yet push themselves artistically; I think Wire, the Ex and maybe even Godspeed You Black Emperor are probably all great examples of this. <i>Joggers and Smoggers</i> is really the first place to start if you want to sum up the Ex in one (double) record; it's not completely obvious but throws you just enough rope to hook you in.

<p class="p1">An early 80's Ex record that I never listened to before now. This falls into the period around "Blueprints for a Blackout" where they started to become more experimental. Their trademark jagged rhythms begin here, though they haven't yet embraced the folk aspect. This stands up well as an example of that time period (and sound remarkably influential on stuff like Fugazi that came later) but I don't know if I need to own that many of these records. I'd say that <i>Aural Gorilla</i> probably caps off this period the best, and opens the door for what was to come on <i>Joggers and Smoggers</i>. Still, they are a brilliant band and this is a good CD. [12 May 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">This is the only Men's Recovery Project record anyone needs - a quick 45rpm 7" packed with their absurdist hardcore/punk experiments. Which actually resemble punk rock only at times. The greatest of their songs, 'Get Your Dick Out of My Food', is definitely a thrash-fest but then has weird keyboards and line-in guitar noise over it all. It's true, it does spoil the flavor. Other tracks are skit-like experimentations with bizarre synths (showing, no doubt, their Devo influence) and some ('My Body is a Jerk') sounding quite like Tuxedomoon. Great from start to finish.

Still, Savage Republic were a great band and this is a fine record. It's production and approach feel a bit dated now, but I suspect if I still have this record in 15 or 20 years it will sound very good. [12 May 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">This first Last Exit album is pretty cohesive.  Ronald Shannon Jackson plays the drums like a fucking typewriter - it's closer to rock than jazz - and that works with Laswell's clangy six-string wank bass.  Brotzmann and Sharrock fight it out and neither one really wins.  They paint images of dirty, dark cities with dangerous alleys, relentless black rain, and never-ending radio interference.  It's all pumped up by Jackson though it never turns into a messy ball of noise.   However, this is very much electrified jazz, or fusion, or whatever, and they never let you forget it.  Jackson also vocalises a bit, either panting about the Emperor of Ice Cream or just growling, which is somewhat forgettable (as are the "jazz" moments, where solos are taken etc.).  But these few missteps aren't enough to drag down the overall album, which is pretty solid and probably better than <i>Iron Path</i>.

A few standout songs like 'Copped It' (with Gavin Friday on guest vocals) and 'Bug Day' are slight departures from the usual Fall style but they work well. The latter in particularly is a menacing, lumbering piece that sounds trapped under its own weight, an underwater. 'Craigness' I guess is about Scanlon himself, and his guitar playing is exemplary throughout. [19 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Jandek in 1992 really found a voice, or at least he made his <i>Rust Never Sleeps </i>here - the acoustic/electric split. On at least on the first half of the first side - there's some genuinely melodic crooning and a sharp sense of irony ('Babe I Love You' mentions his attraction to another's genitals). It gets progressively more deranged, by the time it gets to 'God Came Between Us' -- which is beyond Kenneth Higney in its monotonous warble. The instrumentation is entirely acoustic until the flip, 'The Electric End', which is a freakout like nothing else. It's got some crunchy electric guitars and plodding drums and yelping and I imagine it's actually a band and not just Jandek overdubbing everything himself, though that would be a feat. The actual listenability of 'The Electric End' is questionable - I think it's more interesting than Love's side-long jam but not enough to really lose myself in. [15 July 2012]</p>

Here, the chord is varied a bit, but the music is no less desperate. Jandek should be appreciated because he works in an aesthetic that is extremely personal and influenced by no one. This is the essence of great music, and I'm not saying that to justify listening to this, because I genuinely do like it. It's extremely evocative music - full of despair - but not in a way that can be approached by general audiences. I need to listen to the next 38 of them now. [12 May 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">Of course this is a lot of material to assimilate, but so far I really am satisfied with this purchase. My favorite records so far are <i>Words and Music,</i> the first one, and <i>El Mirage</i>, the last one. The first album would probably stand up against many 90's singer-songwriter efforts in terms of production, but with a far higher pedigree of songwriting. Webb's voice is great - very soulful - and it's a shame no one remembers him for his self-sung material. A lot of these songs should have been hits because they are brilliant, with a more complex approach to lyric writing than pop music really allows. The middle albums have a more rock approach and certainly have their moments ("Galveston" - oh my God!) but I haven't digested them fully yet. <i>El Mirage</i> is produced by George Martin and it's totally overdone, but it works on some songs (like "The Highwayman" and "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress") really well - the baroqueness that made "Macarthur Park" is in full force with Martin helming. I haven't listened to the live disc yet because my copy didn't come with it and I just got it from Rhino a few days ago. [12 May 2005]</p>

These four untitled tracks are pieced together from various jams, experiments and other materials, and it's carefully assembled (in a way that doesn't sound that careful) to create a true statement of unease, disorder and alienation. The fidelity is striking; even though this was all self-recorded, there's an impressive dynamic range and some really moments that I would even call 'beautiful' in terms of motion. It's monotonous but diverse at the same time - when distinct sounds cut through the cloud, perhaps a bowed cymbal or scraped guitar strings - it's a fleeting glimpse of an anchor, which serves to only amplify the confusion. This may be my favourite Hair Police record. A vinyl edition came out, which would be really lovely to have, as this would split really nicely into two sides. [31 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Label: Troubleman Unlimited</p>

<p class="p1">I think of Hair Police as a past-tense band though I guess they are still active. This came out during the time I was living with Robert so it's the period I was most familiar with, though I only saw a few shows that year since Mike lived in Michigan and still does. Irene once said that Hair Police were the perfect combination of an artist, a performer, and a musician, and that's now how I will forever think of them. <i>Constantly Terrified</i> is recorded as a 'band' feel with very little (if any) studio fuckery afterwards. It's a disturbing, stark record that still manages to shake off any sort of 'noise-rock' genre tags and stands as its own voice. There's not a lot of particularly harsh outliers here - it's actually quite a soupy mix, with the broken anti-musical approaches compiled into giant soundchunks. 'Rattlers Echo' is built around an unending drone and Trevor's distraught drumming, a scorched-earth take on jazz hands. 'The Haunting' is dominated by whatever Robert is doing,ending with a great locked-groove rumbling that finished whatever madness was started. 'My Skull Is My Face' returns to the monotony and pounding, but with a ghost vocal over top, chanting over the industrial rhythm, until the squealing electronics battle to the forefront. Title track 'Constantly Terrified' closes it out with meandering saxophone by John Olson over hissing, farting nastyness -- sounding a bit like a Derek Bailey-style improv staged around the gateway to Hell.

<p class="p1">Cost: $0</p>
<p class="p1">Of the many experimental-orientated records and CDs I accumulated from the years 2003-2007, <i>I Don't Want To Live Forever</i> stands out: this is a masterpiece. It is one 35 minute track of Greg Kelley fucking around with his trumpet and a steel drum, but a masterpiece to these ears. The composition uses loops and repetition to create something truly from left field, which takes its time to unfold. The first section is toneless trumpet breath, punctuated with many pauses, and the occasional angry drum interlude. It refuses to situate itself a deep-listening music or noise music either - it's more akin to sound paintings than any type of improvised music tradition. A lot of this is just air, breath through a trumpet, with the removal of pitch, which lends this something personal and visceral. The CD is actually the perfect format for this as well; the many silences at the beginning leave only the struggling motor of the CD player echoing in the room, an ongoing reminder of the futility of silence. The second movement is a long, minimal drone, built from breath I think, that calls to question the nature of recording itself through the artifice of noise, hiss and the like. When the more rambunctious start/stop activity begins again, it's an integration of the first two parts, thicker with a steady trumpet drone until the closing moments. [21 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Source: Mikey T</p>
<p class="p1">Cost: $0</p>
<p class="p1">Robert said that this record feels like the intro to something - a 7" that perhaps introduces an LP. Warmer Milks split their debut single between a fragments, fucked up "song" and a droney, electronic collage. "Rwanda" dances around a theme, and when you feel like it's about to kick it, instead you hear the band scraping chairs off the floor and shuffling things around. It's a real moment of tension that doesn't deliver, which is probably for the better. Despite his incredible talent for songwriting, it seems that Mikey T is determined to destroy any conventional approach to singer-songwriter music - in a method similar to the Homosexuals, a bit. Let's hope it capitalizes on the promise shown by this auspicious debut. [15 May 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $0</p>
<p class="p1">Robert and Daryl work well together though I think I can tell who is who. Walter Carson's minimalist approach is here, with a thick organ drone through the first two tracks under which Robert (I think) mucks about with various smaller sounds. Track 3 takes the intensity down a notch but follows the same formula - acoustic scrapings, knocking things about, and other improvised elements are there under a wavering band of midrange softness, before ascending into some more chaotic tinkering.  A lovely release; this really takes me back.

<p class="p1">Willie Nelson's classic album is a great concept record and beautifully instrumented with minimal guitars, harmonica, piano and steel guitar - it's the ultimate low-key country sound. The first side is built around the 'Time of the Preacher' melody which tells the story of the red-headed stranger, which is actually some of the few songs actually written by Nelson here. The second side has some instrumentals and a few sad sweet, slow songs like 'Remember Me' and 'Hands on the Wheel'. I really would love to get more early records by him, especially the stuff on that <i>Nashville Was the Roughest</i> box, which is pretty goddam amazing. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Emitt Rhodes appeals to the powerpop fan inside me; in high school I loved the "indie" side of music like this, though I never became that wild about the Beatles themselves. This is certainly Beatles-influenced beyond belief, actually sounding more like solo McCartney which hadn't actually happened yet in '70. Some good songs though, built around Rhodes's piano (did he play a Fender Rhodes ever?) and decent arrangements. He plays all the instruments and despite being built around overdubs, songs like 'Long Time No See' (called 'You Must Have' on the jacket but not on the label?) have a surprisingly hard rock edge, with jarring basslines and a good sense of tension.

<p class="p1">Another collection of old SCG insanity, <i>Folk Songs of the Rich and Evil</i> is a collection of, yes, songs, ranging from actual folk pieces to madcap ranting over jazz improv -- like a beatnik from hell. The screaming is outrageous and it's the most wild side of SCG's humour-influenced stuff, but I adore that side of them. <i>Exotica On $5 A Day</i> isn't wildly different in goofyness, but it does have much more percussion, as well as other bizarre instrumentation - there's some shit gamelan, as always, some tribal drumming - and the usual SCG ethnic mashup. Packaged together, these two records perhaps give a sense of very different sides of the band. It's like a blueprint for what they do, except that both collections are just above average, not amazing -- making it hard to endorse this as a must-have, given all of the other riches in the works.

<p class="p1">Another lovely 2xLP reissue by Eclipse; <i>Fresh Kill of a Cape Hunting Dog</i> is a cassette from the mid-80s that shows SCG at their most un-band like; there's tape collages, surreal radio interludes, and some actual jamming that is somewaht boogie-based and throwaway. 'Diet-Blue Morbid Attraction Soda' is a <i>Faust Tapes</i>-like bizarre sandwich, with spoken word creepyness that's familiar to fans of Charles Gocher's style (I'm one!). <i>Def In Italy</i> is a live cassette again, mostly made up of covers, not all of which I recognise, but they range from punk rock pisstakes to spaghetti western soundtracks. Goher and Rick Bishop switch instruments for a limp run-through of Ayler's 'Ghosts', which is actually pretty awesome. Throughout there's crowd tension galore, manufactured by their taunts; and JFA appears on a few tracks! Overall this might be the most fun of the Eclipse reissues. [30 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $10</p>
<p class="p1">This was Richard and Alex's second collaboration, and it's an outlet for Richard to explore his free, electronic side. Side one has three songs, built around percussion, voice and electronics. 'Rolling in the Dew' is delivered with that distinctive Richard Youngs cadence over a steady thump, a staticy middleground and some irregular tiny instrument sounds. 'A Boat Among Whales' is built around a repetitive bump, all soft bassy warmth, which slowly builds in momentum as the duo explores various free techniques - whistles, drones, and cheap sounds made good. The flip is taken entirely by 'Sent onto the Stream', a free exploratory piece in the vein of Richard classics like <i>Knish</i> or 'Goat'. Alex sticks to percussion against Richard's visceral, piercing tones which sound a bit like guitars and a bit like synths. It has the feel of being recorded live, though there's so much going on that I suspect Richard has overdubbed a bit. I haven't listened to this in ages but it's a great one to revisit.

<p class="p1">The first LP by Maniacs Dream is something I picked up back when I met the HP Cycle twins, years before I would meet and befriend and brew beer with members of Maniacs Dream. This is a blast of primitive Kraut-style rock, with toy noise-makers, noodling solos that go nowhere, and an overall inbred mentality. There are more restrained moments of Finnish hillbilly string-bowing, repetitive clopping, and psychedelic soups. This definitely sounds like the more focused side of Avarus in conjunction with Kevin/Friccara Pacchu at points, which is maybe what it is - compared to some of the later releases it's a lot less noisy and occasionally quite hypnotic.

This is going to probably stand out in his entire discography, as varied as it already is, as something distinct and rewarding (albeit brief). [23 July 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">R. Kelly could learn a lot about radio drama by listening to this. Over the course of 3 LP's (and most of my day), Armand tells us the story of his juvenile deliquency and the time he spent in Elmira State Prison. Over half of this is dialogue, with a few songs on each side that veer between blues pub-rock to demented, R. Stevie Moore-esque folk. The lunatic style of singing makes this easier to listen to, because the subject matter is not fun; there's a lot of humour that makes people hanging themselves and getting raped in prison much more entertaining than it would be otherwise. It's exhausting to get all the way through this but it's as compelling as a great Hollywood melodrama, with a lot of personality and some great psychedelic moments. This may be the least messy triple LP I've ever heard. Thank you so much to Jason Finkbeiner for ending my long search for this record. [28 Aug 2005]</p>

Konono No. 1 are on the flip, equally brilliant, no less compelling, and completely different.

I have quite a few records with Chris on them now but this one is a really good example of how he can work in a free/jazz idiom perfectly. Flaherty is a thundering presence, and at times it feels like the alto is about to blow apart; melodic passages are more like teases, which flare up again before you realise it. Throughout it all, Chris is banging away. The push and pull between the two of them is flexible, organically shifting between aggro tone plundering and supportive enhancements. The spirit of the late 60's lives on, and it's a great document of two masters. [27 July 2012]</p>

I think I bought this one on someone in the shop's recommendation, and I'm glad I did! This release is really dry and skittery, with a ton of prepared strings (maybe a violin or guitar), with no echo or decay on anything, and a super erratic, jumpy playing style. It sounds like a solo record, and there's only one MEV member on the cover, so maybe Teitelbaum or whomever just pressed these up cause he needed money. But it's a great time, and pretty much the same pattern for the whole discs. Occasionally some lower sounds sneak in, but they maintain every bit the manic intensity of the rest of it.

<p class="p1"><i>Défense De</i> is all over the map; a studio experimentation made in the high, high 70s by some French avant-garde dudes I never heard of before, and it's a brilliant, invigorating slice of outsider music. This comes a bonus DVD containing the very goofy film and 6 additional hours of jams that I've never dug through - it's the album proper that I mostly listen to. On <i>Défense De</i>, there's a lot of jazzless swinging - crisp drumming, reeds shrieking in the wrong direction, and electric, crackling electronics. It's an open, airy sound that isn't that far off Berrocal but with a bit more prog-rock sand underneath. A few brilliant parts stand out - like where everything stops and it's just pure sound experiments, or some anti-musical clatter in the background. At times it feels like a curious sidestep of the recording process, though this is very much a 'studio' creation. Like the first Nurse With Wound record which put non-musicians in a recording studio to make surrealist art, this has that similar sort of play to it, though some of the playing reveals an undeniable virtuosity. The 6 hours of extra sessions are for a very long and strange rainy day which has yet to come. [30 December 2012]</p>

Her melodic sense is strong and I love the way this record sounds - it works as great late night music, but also as a way to begin the day (which the title suggests). One of my favorites of the year so far. [24 Aug 2005]</p>

This CD is mostly the Black Forest/Black Sea duo but with guests on half the tracks, and those guests are people I subsequently got to know well - Chris, Alex and Daniel from Glasgow; Jan Anderzen and Merja Islaja in Tampere. These improvisations - recorded at Tchai-Ovna in Glasgow! - are nice, but the standout tracks for me are tracks 4, just the duo in Newcastle unaccompanied, and track 5, recorded in Bristol with Nick Talbot playing guitar. When Black Forest/Black Sea leave their comfort zones and get into space madness, I think I like the best. There are some bits here, perhaps the omnichord instrument, that while simplistic in nature, take on a pretty bizarre tonal quality. [18 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I saw this great band, Dreamcatcher, over 3 years ago in Baltimore.  They played in the basement of this fucked up punk squat house - I was on tour with Auk Theatre/Eyes and Arms of Smoke.  The show was a weird bummer, but Dreamcatcher were great and I swapped records with the leader, Blake Hargreaves.  I remembered this being really insane when I listened to it in 2005, but now returning to it, it's much different than I remembered.  There's a lot of processed, distorted vocals and contrapuntal electronics, and at the time I remembered there being some hip-hop influence but I have no idea why.  I guess I've seen a lot of vocal experimentation since then but this isn't droney, it's choppy and rather anti-musical.  There's a deliberate disruption of rhythm and mood and it never really sounds like it's focused.  The outsider vibe is genuine though.  There's some great concrète stuff, such as Hargreaves answering machine tapes (simliar to that cassette release I have by him which is more recent).  This record will probably lie in obscurity forever since it came out in 2002, but it definitely strikes a note more successfully than a lot of what has followed.  [2 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">This is the first proper Pelt full-length to feature the group as a quartet (and I don't think there were many with this lineup).  This is a pretty definitive example of the acoustic Pelt sound.  Mikel D is on shrutibox which really dominates the first track; Jack Rose's acoustic picking comes to the forefront on track 2 (which reminds me of Pelt the last time I saw them, at that weird space in Pittsburgh that Manny briefly ran called The Eye). Mike G is rocking the esraj thoughtout this disc, though it's not always allowed to shine because of the general drone soup.  The last track is Pat Best solo, getting crazy on the cello (and I mean crazy good).  Pelt were really important to me around 1999-2001 and that string of VHF releases (<i>Max Meadows, Techeod, For Michael Hannahs, Empty Bell</i> and I guess <i>Rob's Choice</i>) are "classics" to me, even though I don't listen to them much anymore and the average person might think it's overkill for me to own so many Pelt CDs.  This disc would have stood up against any of those if it had come for me at that time; I still think it's awesome, powerful music but it's just no longer a big influence on me.  So I'll have to remember to spin this one instead of one of the aforementioned 'classics'.  [8 Feb 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">I started getting into Rune Grammofon releases around 2003 but when I heard Nils Økland I really fell in love.  His work is actually pretty different than other Rune Grammofon releases - it's very rooted in traditional/classical musics from Norway, and not really electroacoustic or improvisatory or any of the other things I associate with the label.  Well, it could be somewhat improvisational but it's based on traditional themes.  This follows the awesome <i>Straum</i> with a similar approach - light accompaniment but the main focus being the shimmery, amazing sounding violin of Mr. Økland.  This is almost like minimalist shoegazer - I can just get lost in the sound of the violin, radiating overtones and whispers. The images that come out of it are great though - it reminds me of the woods at night, Bergman films (of course), and fireflies buzzing around on a dry summer night.  [9 Feb 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">Here's a long and satisfying jam that is essentially Pelt with some others. It's never seen as a Pelt release or even known by many people, which is a shame as it contains some thick, heavy passages. There's some major bongo drumming on side 1, over which the thick, searing drones are laid, and the mood takes it's time to develop. The piece extends onto side two, where it takes on the screaming hellbeast quality. By the end we've been taken to a dark place, a musical communion of a band I truly miss in this lineup (even with the extra people who are just extended guests here). [30 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The acoustic, non-Vandersliced form of <i>The Sunset Tree</i> is actually a very different album; there are different songs, and others missing (Hast thou forgotten the tetrapods?) and the intimacy of the boombox is something that I think Darnielle sounds most comfortable with, since he's recorded 500-some songs that way. I would have to say I prefer this take, as the confessional, emotional energy is even more focused without the bass and drums and other arrangements. The scene ends badly as you might imagine - and with all that has been said about this album's subject matter, I tihnk it's definitely a step forward from Darnielle, who I think has struggled to convey what he used to convey to me before <i>The Coroner's Gambit</i> (but maybe it's just my problem).

<p class="p1">When I bought this, $9 felt a bit steep for what was essentially the proto-release of the most commercially successful band ever (or maybe they were second to the Eagles, whatever) but I guess it's actually quite rare as these things go. The Buckingham Nicks LP is great - as solid as any of the three great Fleetwood Mac records, but with a brash innocence. There's a few familiar songs - 'Crystal', written by Stevie but with Lindsay singing lead being a nice alternate version to the more well-known one. 'Stephanie' is a wonderful instrumental with British folk influence, though still retaining that distinctive 70's pop-rock flavour. 'Frozen Love' is the only tune written collaboratively and it's built around a driving bass/drums crunch, with breaks into guitar arpeggios. This is probably the happiest these two ever were as a couple, and it's remarkable how fully-formed the sound is - considering they joined an existing British blues-rock band, it sounds like they really called the shots when that happened.

<p class="p1">I bought this record over seven years ago but never once played it and didn't even remember I had it. A weird, invisible warp makes the outer minutes of each side unplayable but dropping the stylus in a bit, I find pretty much what I expected - a lush, flowing soundworld controlled by two masters of texture and atmosphere. Side 1 is very 'ambient' but aggressively so - with full on plush sounds that envelop you, moving in a way that it's easy to lie back and let it go somewhere with you. Side two is a bit more otherworldly, with some distant voices brought in as a suggestion, a relatively exploratory piano part, and no real direction.  It's all just so lovely it almost becomes hard to stomach, but it's a great escape, and I'm sad that the warp means I can't completely give myself to this LP.

But this is nothing particularly mindblowing, and it doesn't really seem very 'Thrill Jockey' to release a record that sounds a bit like early Sun Ra - that American influence of composers like Fletcher Henderson or Duke Ellington. The titles also suggest a space theme that doesn't really jump out of the music, though this is a pretty solid record. 'Hypnotic', the last track, is the most appealing, taking it's time and being content to just roll out a sassy, coy melody that manages to actually burrow into my head a bit. [23 August 2012]</p>

This has a pretty great lineup as 'The Din' - Thurston Moore, the classic Pelt trio lineup of Best/Rose/Gangloff, and Corsano; yet, I still find myself mostly annoying when Foole himself begins to domainte the proceedings. There are some excellent, lovely bits of interplay especially by what I think is Pelt, which is mostly why I keep this disc - and anything with israj on it, I can't toss.

<p class="p1">Hear ye, hear ye - there was a time, just a mere seven years ago, where the so-called 'noise underground' was conquered by two strange Californians called the Skaters. They were named after John Ashebery's amazing poem and they came seemingly out of nowhere with a recording called <i>Dark Rye Bread</i>, and minds were blown. For a brief period I became intertwined with these fellows, first meeting them on Marcia Bassett's roof in Brooklyn, then again in Glasgow several times, then also various other random encounters in places like Paris and Berlin. At times, they made music in the 'ecstatic drone' genre better than anyone ever had; at other times they were just 'ok'. Their legendary live set at Subcurrent 2006 failed to really move me, but everyone else thought it was the bees knees. <i>Gambling in Ohpas Shadow</i> came from their original run of CDrs, the material which they based their legacy on, if there is such a legacy now - I suspect James's solo work has probably eclipsed Skaters in terms of popularity, but I still have a soft spot for it. I forgot how actually dirty and distorted Skaters recordings are - and how impulsive, wild and improvised they are despite being, as a friend put it, "one really great sound that just goes on for 20 minutes". It's monolithic, but there's still a ton of movement; it's music of the truest psychedelic form, though it's rough around the edges and carefully calibrated as such. Skaters are no idiot savants; they knew exactly what they wanted to do aesthetically, and the two of them had a pretty incredible relationship even if it they were two of the most ridiculous people I've ever met. I'm still a bit pissy at Spencer Clark cause he owes me money but James I will always love, even if I never see him again. This is the only one of their physical releases that landed in my music accumulation from this time but my fondest (and least fond, come to think of it) memories are strictly non-musical anyway.

<p class="p1">Ben Patterson's early Fluxus compositions begin with something recorded in the late 90's, a bit of an irrelevant start since this is supposed to be 'early' work, but the Fluxus spirit is evident - Patterson narrates while repetitive foley artist sounds blast through. The rest of the disc actually is recorded from 1960-62 and contains compositions performed on double bass, paper, wind-up toys and other things. The recordings are live, so we hear the audience laughing and applauding, and for something as ephemeral (and visual) as a Fluxus performance, the format of a sound recording seems really inadequate. But if you're interested in the historic document of an amazing movement in music, like me, this is lovely. The last cut, 'Pond', features a small army of goofy noisemakers, using their voices as well as toys and other junk, and it's a brilliant bit of fractured madness. [20 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">De Stijl reissued this lost private-press record which is really a ramshackle exploration of different genres. It starts with a 12 minute freakout that touches on free jazz, shortwave radio recordings, and electronic composition, but then later on that side of the record we get beat poetry, slide guitar, and a straight-up folk song at the end. The flip is no more clear - there's some vague blues-band jamming, and very amateurish singing. The whole release is totally off-the-cuff, recorded live for the majority of it, and yet somehow still maintaining a collagey, <i>Faust Tapes</i>-esque feeling. I never think to pull this out and listen but it's a lot more fun than I remembered. [18 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Live at Morden Tower in Newcastle, 1983! Thirty years ago almost, and this has Richard and a second Rupenus ripping up sound in a frantic, multiphasic manner. It's impossible to focus on any one element because it's so busy, but that's not a bad thing - it actually doesn't get tiresome or irritating. I've always loved New Blockaders for having an incredible depth to their sound construction, avoiding the monotony of typical harsh noise/power electronics artists. This is pretty goddam experimental, but also has qualities that I would call "musical", which is why I've been drawn to artists like John Wiese and New Blockaders - there's the same drama, motion, beauty, texture and magic that so-called "regular" music has. I was only 3 when this was made, but I did see their last live performance (as far as I know) which attained the physicality the best noise sets I've ever seen have achieved - I also think of some Wiese sets, Spencer of course, Emil Bealieu, and Testical Hazard - and while the LP doesn't have the sheer blistering energy of that, I can still feel some of that heat.

It turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise - instrumental folky noodling, sure, but not at all "free" - quite composed, together and structured. I think they are from Australia and at a full 80 minutes you get a lot of it, but it sounds quite nice and I'd like to see them live (some tracks at the end fall into a more jamgrass/Kraut feel, not unlike Urdog maybe, which sounds fun live).

Alex Neilson guests on the 22 minute jam 'Haight-Ashbury Legal' as well as a cellist; this is an extemporized jazz jam, sounding a bit like an Alice Coltrane-flavoured concoction, but this is a 'blues power cake' after all. It's a really mellow and relaxing jam and has a lot of jazzy noodling - a different side of Phil Todd. Closer 'Skylark in a Cake' is more along the buzzing, burning Ashtray sound and order is restored. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Every time I move my record collection from place to place, I should think about the many kilograms of absurd nonsense I am dragging around. Now, I'd never part with this - all SCG vinyl is like gold to me, even if it's fool's gold. This is supposed to be a bootleg release of a 2004 gig in Montreal, though I suspect it's more 'legitimate' than it looks. The Girls are in full-on goofball mood here. The whole concert is a big jam, but this isn't improv completely, though the guitar playing is skittery and wild - these are clearly rehearsed songs that just never appeared anywhere else as well as free jazz excursions. There's a series of songs, mostly built around Alan and I guess Charles Gocher's nonsense singing - 'Six Kids of Mine' being a tribute to crib death; 'Man Destroys the Things He Love' in two parts. Some covers as well - 'Natural High' by the Commodores, a jokey yet soulful mess, until Rick Bishop busts out a note-for-note perfect solo in the middle. Lots of insults to French-Canadians too, not that there's anything wrong with that -- even the LP labels are adorned with "Guy LaFleur's Ladies" and "I Love Poutine", so we're clearly at a high level of discourse. But I laugh throughout - I love all sides of SCG and if they weren't being comedians half the time I would truly love them less. By the end, it's descended into screaming and taunting the crowd, mostly for being Canadian. Overall, this is probably the most unrestrained and ridiculous SCG release and that's saying a lot.

This one definitely doesn't live up to their potential. It takes awhile to get going, opening with acoustic strumdrone and some moaning. The songwriting seems to be less of a focus here, with the group instead creating sketches using their limited palette. [6 Nov 2005]</p>

<p class="p1">I was around when Modey Lemon was getting going - quite a lot, seeing them go from a sideproject of Phil and Paul's band Dean Swagger into a full-fledged local sensation, then adding Jason to the band and starting to explore a new sound. This picks up a few years later after I had been away and not really witnessing their glory days. Its a long disc, at 54 minutes, and produced quite well - as a driving, catchy indie rock band should sound, with some psychedelic flourishes. The booklet is great, with Phil's lyrics written out and a nice handmade/zine feel to the notes. Phil has such a fairytale sense of songwriting and it suits this - the soft, fun side of the band that the driving riffs and Bonham-esque drumming might not indicate. The ragged two-piece sound is so far behind here that I wouldn't even necessarily recognise this if I had it played for me Invisible Jukebox style - though i guess this is really what Modey Lemon were. 'Countries' is a song that Phil and i used to play together during our brief jam sessions on Penn Ave, some of which i have unmixed somewhere (especially missing that song 'Architects and Warriors' -- what did I actually contribute to those sessions? I can't even remember). Ultimately, as close as I was with these guys (Jason remains a very close friend) I can't say that I am ultimately very familiar with their discography. I think they put out another full-length after this but I never even heard it. [1 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">CD singles are a dumb format but it's appropriate for this Box Codax release, which is incredibly silly. Stupid, even, as 'Boys and Girls' is some sort of weird jokey novelty cut, with funny voices and everything. The inherent Germanness of the artists keeps it from sounding like the Bloodhound Gang or something like that - there's actually something commendable about the tune. "B-side", 'Red Wine in Tunis', is goofy spoke narrative over a somewhat pretty electric guitar figure. Not much else to say here as it's such a blip in my consciousness. [24 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">It's funny to listen to this, cause I never had before - there was shrinkwrap on it still today. Nick passed me both of their CDs when I lived with him, which was just after this came out - the second CD by the biggest sensation in the UK at the time. And now just a few years later, they almost feel forgotten, though I'm sure they can still pack a venue on their tours. If they're even still active, which I don't know. This starts off strong, with 'The Fallen' and then the ELO-influenced 'Do You Want To' which I think was the single (at least, I remember seeing posters for it wheat-pasted all over Glasgow in Autumn 2005). This was the second album which was supposed to establish them as more than a one-hit wonder; I'm not sure if it was successful. It's certainly as good as a British guitar-indie record can be, with the appropriate "obscure" influences (in this case, Orange Juice) and a modern, crunchy production. The songwriting is just OK; nothing has the beer-commercial appeal of 'Take Me Out', which is probably why this was less successful. 'Walk Away', which was a soft-rock leaning ballad, and I think the second single, is probably the Franz Ferdinand song I like the most, and the only thing I really remember from hearing these songs a lot at that time.

This is a great album of dark soul - great singing, great songwriting, great production. It belongs to the "slow jams" genre perhaps, which is quite unrepresented in my record collection. The opening cut 'By Your Side' I used to jam a lot around 2002. Never checked out her other records and probably never will. [9 October 2012]</p>

The dark obsessions of those brilliant first few BOC albums are there, but not quite as obvious. This sorta reminds me of the 80's paisley underground scene of bands like Rain Parade. I don't know if this was ever issued in the first place - it may be the first time it's ever seen the light of day - but I'm glad it has. It's a worthy addition to the BÖC canon and it stands up against those first 3 albums. [21 May 2006]</p>

<p class="p1">This era of Daniel's band might be the one I know best, though Alex is still on drums here and I guess it's the era after he left that I saw and heard the most. It's before Daniel dropped his name from the project and treated it more as a band, though that name change isn't tremendously meaningful. This is a well-recorded radio session and has some great interplay, particularly between Chris and Alex who had such a good relationship at the time; but ultimately it's still driven by the vocals, which are on most tracks. 'Sleep Norway Sleep', 'Weevils' and 'The Tumble Waltz' in the middle are where I start to drift; I used to know this material well but I feel their later work, particularly what was on <i>Wayward the Fourth</i>, eclipses it so much. There's far more neoclassical musical figures here than later, which is also something I'm glad has been moved past. I hope I don't sound too critical; it's a lovely CD (and packaged in a lovely handmade case by Brainwashed) but it's certainly minor compared to the studio work. I guess as a document of the band with Alex this is probably the one to have. [29 December 2012]</p>

This finds Bowie in the dark art-rock mode, with creative production by Tony Visconti and several songs written and arranged with Eno. This unsurprisingly recalls Eno's work with Talking Heads at the same time, though perhaps a bit weirder. The opening track sounds like something off Cale's <i>Paris 1919</i>, but the rest of the album is more akin to Eno's own art-rock experiments. There weren't any hits on this, but 'Boys Keep Swinigng' could have been one. [26 Dec 2006]</p>

The opening cut, 'Baptism &gt; Bar &gt; Blues', absolutely explodes with fantastic cymbal-bashing, a driving riff, and ecstatic horns. It's about the most joyous moments I've ever heard from VCO and this is a band whose reputation is based on ecstatic drone jams. In fifteen minutes it doesn't really change, of course, but that's not why we tune in to Radio Vibracathedral. Everything segues together into a harmonic blur. We get all manner of instruments, tuned to maximum overtones, making the title appropriate. This is an actual studio recording, and I must say it amplifies the beauty of this music, greatly. I also pull out <i>Versatile Arab Chord Chart</i> as my go-to VCO release but this one is maybe better. [31 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A CD-R of Lucas solo, centered around the cassette-tape manipulations he does so well in Wooden Wand. The sound is appropriately lo-fi, pulled from all sorts of unlisted sources. There's some effects involves, generally delay, but it's not overwhelming. I can just imagine him rocking the crossfader on his mixer like he does when they play live... cutting the tapes in and out, he creates a staccato "cloud of fire", showcasing his fascination with sound recording.

<p class="p1">This is a split between these two very odd sound/noise artists, given to me by that lovely guy Laurent whose house I stayed at once in Mechelen, Belgium. The Evil Moisture side is one long piece of harsh electronics, with gurgling, churning momentum underneath and various layers of buzzing. It's constantly changing, active in the higher registers, and engaging for the most part though it does become tiresome. The Metalux side is a real pleasure though, with weird songforms organised around thick guitars, angelic vocals, and pinging keyboards. It's much more genre-bending than I ever expected from Metalux, who I am only familiar with through their work on that Freenoise tour but now wish I had checked out more of in their heyday.

<p class="p3">Thought this is the only Spunk album I actually own on an official format, this is probably the one I've listened to the least just because it's on CD and I never think to listen to CDs (despite having hundreds of them).  A shame too, because it's a really amazing, adventurous exploration of sound and spirit.  The recording is great too - quite dry, and allowing the weird electronics and processed instruments to have their full dynamic range as opposed to a reverb-soaked copout.  There's a lot of motion and percussive elements, I think largely processed voice, but held together as a group work.  It's hard to get a sense of the composed to improvised ratio, but it doesn't really matter because its such a fascinating listen.  I don't know if Spunk are still an active band - they haven't released anything since this - but if not, this would be a great way to go out.

Still, I might give it another listen and see if it grows on me somewhat. [28 Dec 2006]</p>

'Can Dialectics Break Bricks?' has the presence of some cheap keyboards playing a busy, ecstatic melody under the rubble. 'Two chimes for a Tuesday' has chimes indeed, another lighter, higher approach. The heavy drone comes in for 'A Four Foot Banana', which features drumming and a searching acid-saturated guitar lead. Of course, it burns out rather than fading away. [25 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">This was never my favorite B12 record but listening again, the fourth side is an excellent side-long collage of musique concrete, moving between reverb-treated spoken word sections (of dry British howto-diy instructions) and jittery, nervous scraping.  It anticipates the <i>Candy</i> triple LP but has a significantly wider palette, and it may mark a major change in direction for Alasdair.  The first record is the one I'm not that crazy about.  It has its moments, but generally is more related to the earlier 4LP boxset stuff, which is strangely dancey.  Parts of side two actually remind me of something like The Orb - kinda blissful, chillout music with samples that doesn't even hint at the warped sounds that are capable of coming out of the B12 project.  [26 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">This is one of the crisper and more structured Vitamin B12 records, though it's full of jerky stop-start rhythms.  Both sides are made up of numerous short tracks but it really is just two side-long pieces.  The first side is an instrumental, largely sax led piece that is either constructed entirely from cut up single notes, or a very composed New York jazz kinda sound.  I think it's probably assembled by Alasdair from individual samples as it sounds computer-precise, but it's awesome either way.  Side B brings in some singing from Karen Mori and has a lumbering, awkward Residents type of feel.  It's rare to compare the B12 to any other artist and this comparison is only approximate - really, it sounds like a clean "pop" version of the Vitamin B12, and it's hard to believe that my experience with these guys has been in largely improvised settings.  By the end we're being told that we are eating at Denny's, a strange sentiment to close a really strange (yet accessible) album. When I first got this record 3 years ago I wasn't so into it but right now I'm on the verge of a B12 obsessive period so it sounds like wonderful manna from heaven.  [25 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">It's rare to come across a triple LP where I don't feel that it could have been a lot shorter. This is probably the best B-12 I've heard yet, consisting of unidentifiable, crazy cut up sounds probably generating from acoustic instruments at some point but manipulated to death. Lots of this sounds like a tape unraveling off a spool, very much in the Lied aesthetic. There's so much movement and I strangely find this accessible - it sounds like it was very carefully put together with a lot of attention to rhythm and motion. Are Vitamin B-12 the best-kept secret in Britain? Are they even a secret? [14 May 2006]</p>

<p class="p1">Another Vitamin B-12 stunner, <i>Pickpocket</i> is built entirely around vocal samples, presented in a cut-up manner with a lot of repetition and rhythm. It's a complete concept executed well, with humorous and random elements and a good sense of space. On the second side there's a part where it starts to layer too much and almost becomes the wall-of-sound potential hinted at, but then before it's overwhelming it pulls back. Male and female interplay is used well, and while actual meaning is fairly abstracted, there's enough words and proper names (a call from Karen is really repetitive) to suggest a broken narrative. The Bohman Brothers did some things like this when I saw them live, though this is much less concerned with non-vocal sounds (excepting  tape hiss, some knocking sounds, and other incidentals of the source material).

<p class="p1">Another great B-12 release, this one is clearly culled from improv sessions, not unlike the ones I played in with them. This is jittery, schizophrenic music made from guitars, percussion, and sparse electronics. Whenever Alasdair edits this stuff into accelerating momentum, as on here, I find it truly exciting - improvisation, sure, but with an effect on the listener not shared by much of the genre. My few sessions jamming in Brighton definitely rank among the most enjoyable musical interactions I've ever had. [3 November 2012]</p>

'Punahou Carnival 2005', the title of which suggests it was actually recorded on one of Alasdair's numerous trips to Hawaii, is buried in flanger, phasing and reverb - the source material definitely has voices, flutes and other unidentifiably processed sounds, so it could be from that. The A-side is one long pece, 'Are You Ready for Your Tea Sidney?' constructed from old tape loops, with that rolling, bumpy momentum that I used to strive so hard to achieve myself with Lied Music. It's spacious - it really breathes, in a beautiful way - and near the end, some backwards, elliptical drones take over, creating an elegy of the unsettling. There's no other artist on earth capable of creating a vibe like this. [9 November 2012]</p>

This is very sample-based, but with a lot of their own instrumentation in here. A lot of sequenced rhythms, but in a goofy, retro novelty electronic way instead of anything danceable -- and then lots of organs and guitars. SH&amp;W avoid obvious humour, going for "just funny" instead of "funny ha-ha". As a musical construction, this is fantastic - there's a great bit of detail and the pieces are structured brilliantly. While the whole project is laced with irony, there's something really inviting about the finished product. [1 August 2012]</p>

This is what Lee does well, and even though this is really old (2002) it's a good M.O. for his work (or at least what I know of it - I have little engagement with his recent activities). By the end it sounds nothing like sparklers and more like something clanging around in a bowl. Ben's track, more composed than improvised, is from heat lamps burning some fax paper.

This CDr contains 3 tracks in about 25 minutes from live recordings of extremely minimal deep-listening stuff. Because I have my window open, it's essentially unhearable right now; more like a 'presence', a minor chill that passes through every one in awhile.

But at two discs, I can't help but feel that they are repeating themselves a bit. The minor key intervals and percussion continues the progress into Third Ear territory begun on the last recorrd, which is definitely not a bad thing - but I can't help but wonder why they didn't trim it down to one fantastic single album.

<p class="p1">Over time, <i>Lighthouse </i>has risen to prominence for me as an 'all-time great' album, certainly one of the most accomplished double LPs I've ever encountered in my time of listening to music.This was the one that blew things open for me, and it's easy to see why - <i>Lighthouse</i> is a master plan of musical strategies that satisfy all of my idiosyncratic tastes. But beyond that, there's a perfect balance between verbal language and musical language here. Darren Harris's words are so carefully chosen, yet absurd; they occupy a dry, strange and obtuse British territory, as quotable and ridiculous as Monty Python but done without obvious humorous intention. This leads to four sides of obsession, a dark masterpiece weaving together life in sterile, postmodern Britain (just at the Blair years were beginning); and all of the nonsense about King Arthur, the RAF, the  R.N.L.I and the sea/lighthouse themes are part of the Folkstone mythos to me. But what's behind the music is the most radical - this is a redefinition of song structures, using everything that shouldn't be part of a song. This anti-musicality is of course extremely musical - it's constructed in a way that is careful and alien. I've never tired of it, and the last two sides still contain a lot of unexplored territory. I read someone compare this to <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> and it's as much a treasure map as that, if not moreso - though perhaps devolved someone after 30 more years of musical history has passed. What a fucking masterpiece; I have spent the last few years in awe of <i>Lighthouse</i> and wishing I could one day realise something as visionary myself. [27 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">It felt like there was a few things that happened to my view of music around late 2005, when I moved to the UK and had to kick my habit of buying tons of records.  First, there was the explosion of people releasing music online, via their Myspace pages or whatnot - I mean, it certainly existed before then, but it really became apparent to me that it was emerging as a normal, even "necessary" way for people to get their music heard.  This of course meant that suddenly every guy with a microphone (or not even) could put their ideas out there, which was liberating and democratising.  Second, the tide of lost forgotten psych/weird masterpieces increased to become more like a tsunami.  Instead of the few choice reissues each month (which were carefully selected by labels I loved and trusted), it was suddenly near-impossible to keep track of how much old music was coming out.  The term "privately pressed" entered the lexicon of hip and zillions of "lost classics" were given a second breath, though usually in limited pressings equal to (if not smaller) the size the originals were released in.  These two trends met in the middle through blogs and Soulseek - rare lost records that were not being reissued were at least digitised and put out there by legions of curiosity seekers, for free.   Now, all of this is totally excellent - liberating and democratising, as I said above - but it also conflicted with my perverse desire to be on top of everything.  Suddenly I felt overwhelmed and I was too poor to keep up with te vinyl, and I didn't have the time to download evertything. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">This is probably actually good for me, as I began to focus on the things that I did love much more, and I saved a lot of money, and I generally loosened up and learned that I could be happy not knowing about something.  Now, the recommendations of trusted friends are much more valuable to me than that of JohnnyBlogger34 or even some of the labels I used to really like.  I know this sounds negative, but a great deal of these records are lost for a reason.  And many are really and truly great, so the important thing is always to listen and try to hear something for what it is - which is just hard when there's 400 billion old albums out there (and 400 billion new ones as well).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">So my music intake has fallen into a sort of structured anarchy (structured here by this list, and my guiding lines, but without any previously-soughtafter dream of completeness).  What does this have to do with the Satwa record?  Well, I think this is a really excellent lost psych-folk record, easily on par with something like the Black Sun Ensemble or Virgin Insanity (though much more musically accomplished than the latter).  The thing is, I feel like it was kinda lost in the clutter for me.  I bought this cheap from Volcanic Tongue cause it had a damaged cover, then maybe listened to it twice over the past 3 years.  It's quite competent, with a heavy Middle Eastern influence despite its Brazilian origins - and recorded in a way that the overtones from all the strumming can really resonate.  And of courtse, Nemo did a beautiful reissue job.  But the sad thing is, I can't say that I actually connect with this music in any way.  In the past I may have felt connections to weird reissued records perhaps falsely, due to their obscurity.  Or maybe that's not true at all and I'm just trying to intellectually justify why I can recognise a record like this as competent but have no passion for it myself.  But I think if I had heard this maybe six years ago instead of 3, I would have grown with it - learned its chord progressions and beautiful moments and truly considered a favorite.  Now it's just one more on the shelf that is nice to listen to now and then, and assessments like that kind of challenge my whole conception of musical greats and landmark albums.  I don't know where I am going with this so maybe I will try to write more later.  [18 March 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">I have a real thing for the somber elegies of Nils Økland, who I first heard via his Rune Grammafon CD <i>Straum</i> some years ago. This is an earlier release, which has additional Norwegian folkies playing behind him on guitar, percussion and other things, but the violin is still first and foremost. His tone is so melodramatic it's almost sickening, and I wonder if I was more familiar with Norwegian folk tunes if I would find this to be too much. But instead it's a beautiful, haunting record of thick lush strings, reverberating through my imagination - stars in the Northern sky, sung to with abstract vocalisations and the most beautiful of the violin's possibilities. There's some churchy organ stuff too which works well in balance, but it's really the violin I'm after. [30 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Ray Off, here a quartet, deliver three tracks of beautiful strangeness. It's so easy to idealise music from New Zealand, especially when it has this inviting night-time quality. There's a spaciness to things with the guitars and keyboards being made to ring out, with just enough delay/reverb to suggest another world. But then there's moments of subtle beauty - the plucking zither over dense organ drone + cello in track 2 is a moment of abstract genius. There's a romanticism to this sound, even when it flares towards something slightly more malevolent. I don't really know what happened to this band (or label) but when I remember to listen to this (which is not often, as it ends up in the spineless box of CDr releases, easily forgotten) I love where it takes me.

<p class="p1">I award this my 'best of genre' award, with the genre being "music". I have such a connection to this album, even though it's inherently dissociative and left-brained. Of all the Homosexuals-related projects this one is the most mysterious and I'd say successful, though I never really kept up with the legends so I'm not even sure which members are responsible for it. What I do know is that <i>Triptych of Poisoners</i> is a compendium of possibilities for playing music as a group, a skeleton key for ideas, none of which are particularly well-developed. The rock stuff is clearly culled from jams and overdubbed with various layers of vocals and strange sounds; the less formed interstitial tracks are even more loose, sometimes complete sci-fi jokes ('Mr. Fridge') and sometimes soundtracky bits of improv ('The Plan Must Rule'). It stops every time it starts to get going; it leaves me wanting more from track to track. It doesn't sound like anything that ever came before or after it, including the Homosexuals themselves, except for maybe <i>The Faust Tapes</i>, but really only in structure (and this is not a collage - these are distinct tracks). It makes a lot of sense that this was released on Alga Marghen, who I think plans to reissue the entirety of the It's War Boys label, though I think they've only done this and the Modern Shit release. Absolutely, totally inspirational to the nth exponent. [19 August 2012]</p>

It wasn't even that long ago, but I was way into this stuff in 2005 and now I haven't heard a peep from him or the label in a long time. This is a solo project that uses a wide array of instrumentation (electric guitars, organs, static, field recordings, etc.) to make epic, spacey instrumental jams. It's loose, but colourful; evocative of starry nights on the other side of the world, and a real audio fantasy. There's a tendency towards weird, rumbling mystery here - I'm reminded at times of F/i, though without that ramshackle quality - and the home-recording approach is perfect, neither hi-fi nor lo-fi. It actually gets rocking at points - there's quite a lot of musical competence on display - and I wish I heard his other recordings as well. [30 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Inca Ore has an interesting solo vocal approach - she has no problem with burying the voice in layers of effects and delay, rendering her larynx into a lo-fi soup base. The first side is a series of shorter pieces which are most effective when subtle hooks emerge.

<p class="p1">It's finally out - the sprawling, excessive 3LP debut (and finale) from Valley of Ashes. At first listen it just sounded like Kris Abplanalp and his friends dicking around for about two LP's too long, but then it grew on me. That totally smokey, late night Rufer St. vibe is captured, and even though this band broke up before I had met any of them, it feels very familiar and nice. The violin - I guess that's Natalie? - is a really nice presence, though the thin recording is a shame;; I guess a lot of this is done on a dictaphone. David's bass is also lost a bit, unfortunately. There's some scorching Amon Duul II-style guitar playing on side 2, and side 5 is a really beautiful organic ball of drone that reminds me of Scatter or Jewel Antlercathedral stuff. Side 6 is a great finale, actually incorporating some scratchy Kentucky hoedown guitar and building up a hillbilly porch jam. Everything is dark, not in terms of being sad or depressing but in a nighttime way. Three records might be a bit much but if this is their one and only statement, then it's not such a bad way to do it. I never lived in Louisville and sometimes feel like I shoulda moved there instead of Lexington, but this gets the imagery: the bumpy dark landscapes of the Highlands, late night hangouts in Tyler park, drinking Falls City, sleeping on Rosenblum's floor after an evening of drinking, playing and hanging out... the music might not directly manufacture these memories for me, but it certainly suggests something. Yeah, they're just jamming without direction and there's a million other bands that do this, but this particular assortment of personalities does bring something special to it and I'm glad this finally saw the light of day.

Punchy synthetic bursts of static and noise jump around, occasionally quite rhythmically, with a few waves of volume that are quite disorienting. She keeps the plate clean and leaves a good bit of space to keep things from getting too muddy. And it's a tribute to David Tudor - not a million miles away from <i>Rainforest</i> I guess.

'Where Fortune Smiles Bewares' is an abrupt turn towards a more electronica side. The closing track is probably the highlight, a rambunctious clean-channel guitar noodle over a quiet underwater loop with some crying voices underneath. It gets stuck in an actual loop in my CD player, making the end of the track impossible to listen to, but it's not a bad eternity to share, if unrepresentative of Ashtray's usual aural assault.

<p class="p1">Frank and Etienne, two gents I sorta know in Paris, play in this goofy children's music band. Apparently they do pretty well travelling around to schools and whatnot. As someone who was really interested in doing the Grand Buffet children's album a few years ago (whatever happened to that project anyway?) it's great to hear the French take. If I had kids I would definitely play this for them. There's a Moondog cover and a bunch of happy, catchy songs with a fairly rock edge to them. Some of the guitar parts are actually quite weird and definitely more far-out than anything I ever heard as a kid. Plus I can imagine Etienne dressed up like a penguin doing this. I don't know if I'll listen to this very often but it's a fun thing to have, perhaps to play at parties. [11 May 2006]</p>

I miss Phil and I never got as close to his songs as I would have liked. This is a guy who, when we were at University together, actually majored in songwriting (as a self-designed major that combined music and anthropology, or something like that). Lots of acoustic strums here, and some earnest singing. There's a real simplicity here - the songs are basic, often accompanied with just a second lead guitar, and it sounds a bit like some of the 90s lo-fi indie stuff I liked, Shrimper-label style, etc. Even the more raucous sons, like 'Hanging on the Line', still have the home-recorded sound. I think he's made some more Hidden Twin stuff since but I don't really know what direction he's gone in. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I'm actually listed in the liner notes here -- apparently I recorded some of this, possibly the Louisville show. This is the quartet of BxC that I really miss; three live shows, split somewhat awkwardly over four sides and with proper cassette fidelity. The Louisville show has a really great, jazzy drum solo from Trevor at the beginning before it melts into the thick resonance of the whole quartet. Trevor isn't on the Columbus show so therefore it's far more electronic in nature, with deep rumbles and all sorts of motion. The second half, starting side C, becomes a calvacade of scraping, bursts of electronics, and the musicians teasing each other. It's beautiful. In Lexington, a show I must have been it but can't remember really, which beings with a cloudy, cavernous dark drone (it was in the Icehouse, after all, which sounds that way) before the Shiftlet-less trio really lets lose in a true state of complete freedom. Lovely set, and silly, idiotic band photos and a great title too. [30 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Jan's first solo Tomotonttu release came out alongside our Lied Music LP, so you know that was absolutely ages ago! Listening now, it's surprisingly more aggresssive and repetitive than I remembered, especially compared to his later stuff and his live show which (at least the last few times I saw him) was built around broken, melting rhythms and thick layers that overlap. There's certainly the foundation of that here, but it's also got a lot of little excursions into one sound idea that he sticks with for a minute or two before moving on. This is so very much a 'solo' project and definitely in-line with a lot of the noiseniks coming out of Finland at the time, though there's a more manic/soft duality than Kuupuu or JP's stuff or any of the solo Avarus stuff. The recent two KY records have gone more in the direction of the solo genius, though I think Jan really separates the assemblage method of a KY release from Tomotonttu, which is all his source material - something I completely understand.

There's a massive wall of industrial blare here, and it doesn't get any clearer as it goes along, though Neil starts to shout, yell, moan, etc about halfway through. This is far closer to the Vibratcathedral/Total "ecstatic drone" genre and significantly less evolved towards his love of the Kompakt label and minimal electronica; it feels like an Astral Social Club that isn't quite there yet. Actually this wouldn't surprise me if it's not solo, as there's so much going on that John Clyde-Evans may be present too, though there's nothing credited and you know what people can achieve with technology like looping pedals ....

This is a great Tomutonttu release, one that should be reissued maybe on vinyl. Toy rayguns at war, a battle that feels ultimately silly, like troops fighting over a potato; there's spazzy digital percussion outbursts in the corners. Short attention span theatre for sure. A nice long dirgy bit, though sounding like treble-attenuated miniatures - and then it goes all rambunctious and stops before it wears out its welcome. I think this is 20 minutes of music on one side of a 60 minute tape. When I got this tape, I had no idea what 'tripla puisto' meant in Finnish, or that I'd ever live there.

<p class="p1">i've never known whether or not to 'believe' in this record's veracity; Alex Neilson and I were convinced that these synth recordings were actually made by Cassis Cornuta or Dennis Tyfus or one of the current Antwerp crew of weirdos.  The question that this raises, regardless of if it's true or not, is "why does it matter?"  Shouldn't the music itself carry eveything?  Why would I be more interested in these recordings if they were made by some obscure dead guy than if they were made by Lieven Maartens?  I don't usually go for minimal synth records but this one does sound lovely. There are some little quick beeping sounds that create a rainlike pattern, which is a really nice layer over the deeper spacey sounds.  It's not purely experimentation for experimentation's sake - there is a focus on constructing a mood, even if everything goes haywire at times.  Of course I go back to the entire package of the record - the cover, some old Flemish family photograph; the insert with one badly Xeroxed face, a moustache almost too-accurately placing this in the mid-70s milieu.  If it's a hoax, it's a well-designed hoax, but again, it shouldn't really matter.  And it doesn't.

<p class="p1">This is a vinyl reissue of some of the choice recordings from the original tape boxset of this West Coast tour, which was duo of Spencer and Robert.  Side 1 is a playful fight between an insanely scratchy, cheap-sounding violin and Robert's acoustic appraiser, which is bubbing all of the place.  The recording quality sounds distintly handheld, or maybe it's a cheap PA, or maybe they just wanted it to sound like that - and on vinyl, it sounds great but annoying (if that makes any sense).  By the end, my head hurts and they're right back where they started.  Side B starts as a slower performance, where Spencer's violin is drowned in reverb and Robert's hearing test machine blends into the sounds slightly.  There's some deep hornlike crawls of sound occasionally punctuated by less reverby violin scrapes, and the hearing test machine occasionally shouting out.  It's almost like they're trying to create a deep underwater feeling but their attention span is too short.  After awhile the reverb cuts out and it becomes a piercing scrapefest again.  The hearing test machine tends to squeal more and the violin is more of a crackling effect.   It ends but then they go into a second piece which is vocals and hearing test machine.  The fidelity is so gritty that the vocals sound even less human than they usually do; Robert responds to it pretty well though the nature of the acoustic appraiser is pretty rambunctious so there are some parts where they are definitely heading in different directions.  [12 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">More 80's Braxton that proves to be innovative and uncompromising. This quartet, with David Rosenboom, Mark Dresser and Gerry Hemingway, is flowery and playful. Rosenboom is prone to fast, dazzling runs, under with Anthony gets quite soulful, sometimes working a slower counterpoint to the more active keys. The final composition is the most cohesive, even though it's the most sparse. The musicians take their time feeling each other out, with a few moments nothing but a bass bowing and a low-registered clarinet. It gets furtive as it goes along, but resists the tendency to go all-in. Braxton had the luxury of a tenured professorial position during this time and it's great that Black Saint was able to take a chance on releasing such uncommercial music. [2 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Well, six years have passed and I'm not sure if I understand <i>The Drift</i> any more. It's certainly become the Scott Walker album I listen to the most - the one the felt the most shocking and raw, even after being familiar with <i>Tilt</i> and all that. I remember getting MP3s of this and going over to Chris Hladowski's house in Glasgow and listening to it with him in his kitchen, and both of us were somewhat slackjawed by it - and Chris isn't even someone who really likes this kind of stuff. <i>The Drift</i> is a dense listen and there are a lot of themes here - genocide, family, intimacy, distance - and that's just a guess as the lyrics and arrangements are somewhat inpenetrable. On thick vinyl, the deep rumbles of a song like 'Clara' sound insane - like four speakers at least, even though it's just on my regular stereo system. There's already somewhat of a myth around the construction of this record - using the peas, the simulation of the World Trade Center falling, etc. - and it's interesting to see how this record crosses into different audiences. (A regular customer from the bookstore who's in his 60s and mostly listens to old country and jazz is way into this album). At a point in my life when it seemed everyone was making a new 'most fucked up record ever' announcement every few weeks, <i>The Drift</i> came along and genuinely won the title.

However, this record has a really warm side that plays with melody in a really visceral way. It's got a "cool" feel, definitely, but that's not to say it isn't human. The first track in particular uses a ascending and descending 5-tone scale to keep a center while the musicians explore around it - it's rooted enough in tradition that I don't think it would scare a lot of people away, and is uniquely Braxton.

<p class="p1">This quartet has George Lewis on trombone and a very stark-sounding Gerry Hemingway on drums. The compositions are very tight - with lots of bumpy sax/trombone interactions. The side-long piece that opens moves through a lot of different territory and is maybe ultimately somewhat inconclusive for me. Melodies come together and then are immediately disassembled; it's diverse, and actually fun, but somewhat overwhelming. The opening piece on side two has a really great bowed bass section and there's some great improvised moments among the structure. I always associate the early 1980s with a time where jazz died, as longtime artists started to take a distinctly more commercial stab. This wasn't the case with Braxton - though I have that weird <i>In The Tradition</i> album, actually from the 70s - in 1983 he is pushing forward and doing exactly what he wants to do, and it's quite commendable.

It begins with 'Calypso Be' by Young Tiger, a slightly silly song about be-bop and the Dizzie Gillespie, ultimately concluding that this music is not for him and Gillespie should go back to 52nd street. I always enjoys songs about another genre of music, but I'm disappointed by Mr. Tiger's appraisal. The more mellow and wordless tunes here are more to my tastes, like Ambrose Campbell. Nothing is quite as catchy as 'At the Coronation' from volume 1, but this is a bit more broad, containing Kwela and some other offshoot forms (which I don't really know the difference of). The more repetitious bits are great because they are casually repetitious, if that makes any sense. Ultimately this is another chapter in a story of a city - the music here, despite it's island flavours, is completely London-based and it portrays a world of Caribbean-descended Londoners trying to make a life.

'Almost Independence Day' is my favourite song of his, better in my opinion than anything on <i>AW</i>. I once bonded with Neil Campbell over that song, and he was going on about how he realised when Van is crooning about 'I can hear the fireworks' that the 12-string guitar playing IS the fireworks, which is no great symbolism but a nice gesture and sharing that with Neil was lovely. I love this song insanely and I try not to wear it out, but the rest of the record is so goddam solid that it's really the one I pull out the most - I mean, after all, you can't rock <i>Astral Weeks</i> every day.

<p class="p3">This Red Krayola is really similar to <i>Hazel</i> or the first s/t Drag City one in that it's a series of fairly straight-forward pop/rock songs.  Of course, nothing is straight when it's Mayo Thompson.  The songs, by any other standards, are extremely weird, extremely wordy, and obtuse.  There are a few songs that deserve to be Krayola classics, like "Psy Ops"; others that are solid and a few that are filler.  But overall, it's a very strong album, the kind that Thompson only makes about every ten years.  It helps that the core musicians are people he's been working with for some time, so it's got a real "band" feel, perhaps moreso than the earlier Drag City releases which feel a bit more hodgepodge.  I've had this for a few years but only listened to it a few times, which is a shame as it's definitely one of their best records overall.  [21 Mar 2009]</p>

Charles Hayward says "We thought people were going to start accepting improvisation instead of parlor games" (or something like that). The music - do I need to say anything new about this? I guess I can talk about the live disc, remastered from cassette recordings. The quality isn't great but you can hear how amazing and powerful they were, especially on the live version of "Health and Efficiency" which sounds like a mountain collapsing onto a song. Even writing this review feels like a waste of time; I should be listening. [22 Jul 2006]</p>

Taking the mentality of the Skaters but giving it a darker, slightly more modal tendency, this CD (and the one I downloaded on Celebrate Psi-Phenomena) are absolutely fantastic, an inspiration for the deep listening psychic alterations. I will be listening to this throughout the remainder of my dissertation writing to clear the head and let new ideas develop. [22 Jul 2006]</p>

<p class="p1">The Lost Domain apparently have been kicking around Brisbane forever to little acclaim, but they're hard workers who conjure an impressive disc of psychedelic drone. The long second track has some slide guitars which get all over the place nuts and it's a nice one to relax to but it still goes into interesting places. I think I met some of these people when I was in Brisbane but I'm not sure - I don't know if they are a tight band or a messy collective - I'd guess the latter. I will rarely listen to this disc but when I do, I like it - especially the more lo-fi tracks with the disembodied voices in the distance. This was probably about it for Brisbane music until that recent outburst of artists that Volcanic Tongue was championing. Maybe it's time to reconsider this city. [28 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A 27-minute solo work by Robert Beatty, <i>Mourning Order</i> works from a serious, intense sound art perspective; it begins with full-bodied synthesizer tones laid on thick, sounding more like drones/horns than like synthesizers often do. After about 8 minutes this shifts to a slow buildup of church bells over a rustling restlessness which feels a bit like water, but is clearly all electrons. This builds into a persistent, abrasive oscillation, too fast to tune out and too slow to ignore. What's magnificent here is the fidelity - it's not of this world, an echo from some alien creation. This was probably a great live set, though it's not recorded live. [23 August 2012]</p>

All of these songs are built around looped vocal fragments with enough delay between them to make a round-type style. This isn't just Richard singing 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' but instead creating a disorientating, yet inviting soundscape around these vocals. It's all acoustic, using some ethnic instruments (shakuhachi which sounds like a ghost; a Thai harp, and some zither too) plus a basic acoustic guitar pattern and slide electric bass under everything.

Using feedback, distortion and the usual bag of tricks, Dreamcatcher make a ruckus and the LP is pretty much as I remember the live show - strangely inviting, despite being a Wolf Eyes-like wall of sound. This somehow sounds like everything else that was happening in that world at that time, yet above average in execution. I don't listen to this much and may not need to carry it around forever, but it's an obscurity even among a genre of obscurities. [8 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Pure free jazz from this fantastic trio, a natural pairing really as all envision 'freedom' slightly differently. Spencer and Corsano are both rather furtive, playing around the pulse instead of directly into the middle, while Flaherty burrows straight through like a rocketship. There are parts of the opening track, 'Human Suffering', that become incredible sparse - like everyone stops for a solo and then it's just Spencer ekeing out an idea on a scratchy, fuzzy violin. His violin takes the higher register, affected at times but not ridicuously so, and often dancing delicately around Flaherty's guttural blasts. On the second side there's some vocal work which is wonderful against Corsano's rolling rhythms. It's a short record but pressed on thick vinyl and the sound is full and encompassing, despite the extreme frequencies at play. [29 September 2012]</p>

The electric piano at the beginning is pretty, a straight-up reminder of old Meisha stuff, and then when everything falls into itself in manages to keep breathing life into itself by recycling it's own momentum. The weirdo electronics here feel so at odds with Mike's acoustic guitar stuff (even when he tries to implement electronics) and also way, way, way better. [28 Jan 2007]</p>

There are nicer moments as well, but the instrument suffers from the recording (contact mics, according to the liner notes) which makes everything sound a bit dirty. I think a better recording of the instrument could probably be made, and that might be more interesting to investigate. [28 Jan 2007]</p>

The tracks are recorded live and sound spacious, echoing through the room. There's a long bit of track 1 where they move to an AMM-style improvisation with quiet clicks and buzzes - it sounds not unlike the bottom falling out of a folk band and wind-up gears instead. Most of this disc is harmonious and lovely, particularly track 3, but it feels a bit indistinct, though it could just be that I still haven't reacclimated to melodic improvised noodling after all these years.

This is electroacoustic music at its finest, and it's easy to see why he clicked so much with Tamburo - Keenan's music is dramatic, passionate, and fluid. The extra track sounds sloppy at first, dobro notes bucking in a breeze, but it rights itself and blazes on with an intensity that is perfect when the final cut, 'A Suspension in Dream Time' takes over. This is a long, immersive piee that is Keenan's masterpiece. I wonder if he'll ever get anything together again. [24 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I don't know anything about these guys (guy? Girl?) but this is presumably guitar-based, and it has some really interesting strange textures that have no real comparisons, but also some parts where they turn on a distortion unit and it sounds like the end of a Mudhoney song. The fuzz parts make it sound very amateurish - not a bad thing on its own - but the really great unusual plinkings and tones seem completely at odds with the other side of them - and they seem to shift between these modes frequently, even within a same piece. But it's very interesting, perhaps the most interesting thing Mike'es released yet. [28 Jan 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a funny thing to pull out. When I lived in Glasgow, my dear friend Giles and another friend/acquaintance Duncan started playing in this band, a strange juxtaposition between pop-emo and something more aggressive. The first time I saw them I didn't even notice that they had two drummers; I was somewhat surprised by the tone of the band, which I thought would be more art-rock. Giles didn't last long due to tension about the direction of the band (one member's explicit goal was to sign to a major label) and soon departed, leaving only these two songs as a record of his involvement. Giles is more rooted in 90s punk/hardcore than anyone I know and thus these two songs have a hard, screamy edge that recalls (thanks to the catchy guitar lines) bands like Cap'n Jazz. I remember hating this when it came out and now it already feels retro and kinda funny (opening lyric is 'This is how I became emasculated'). His eponymous song is certainly the Dananananaykroyd song I remember the most; it's nice to have this, his Howard Devoto moment. After this they embarked on a series of lineup changes and attempts to raise their profile, getting into shitty battle-of-the-bands circuits, eventually signing to Mogwai's label (I think) and well, who knows where they are now? Duncan is a great guy and I hope he's doing well. [18 November 2012]</p>

It's noise music that isn't harsh or distinctly digital - and it's recorded piss-poorly, with complete dropouts and so lo-fi it's almost irritating -- though I like it. On the flip, some shorter tracks: 'Later, Mirror' is a lengthy wave of keyboard drone but they all kinda sound the same. Closer 'Unspent Realisation of Dawning Release' (which has to be about ejaculation, as does the title of the whole cassette) is pretty, and then ends suddenly when the tape runs out.

<p class="p1">Two hours of these three gentlemen is a lot, but it's minimalism isn't it? Jason's tape work adds a lot to the Nmperign sound - to the point where I'm not entirely sure what's him and what's them. The obvious speech samples are there of course, but it's not that frequent, and works really well to change the mood of pieces. It's an entierly different approach to tape improvisation than Luke and I have used, and it's really nice especially on the ultra-minimal stuff (long parts of Disc 2 are almost inaudible in the office environment where I listen). This is a very good meeting of minds (as it was live). [29 Dec 2006]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: €20</p>
<p class="p1">As proof of my own aging, all of Pavement's albums have gotten reissue treatment and I'm barely in my 30s. The <i>Crooked Rain</i> and <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i> reissued are pretty essential as all of the live and b-side material from those eras is part of the cement that holds together my church of Pavement. But here's where it starts to tail off. Don't get me wrong - <i>Wowee Zowee </i>is unquestionably my favourite Pavement album. (Actually, I'll drag out my oft-repeated Mark Twain analogy - <i>Slanted and Enchanted </i>is the Huck Finn of Pavement albums, the 'greatest'; but <i>Wowee Zowee</i>, like <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, is actually 'better'). I bought this album on cassette, on my 15th birthday, and immediately found it a more difficult listen than the previous ones. Being that I was young and determined, I stuck with it, and now find this to be the band's masterpiece. But as far as a double-CD reissue, it's not exactly overkill, but it's far less necessary to me than <i>CR,CR/S&amp;E</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It certainly deserved a reissue (after only 11 years, though) and I scooped it up while in France, just glad to have so many of the extra tracks in one place. The <i>Pacific Trim</i> EP is here in its entirety, meaning I don't have to wear out my very-travelled 7" -- though I still will, because vinyl always sounds better. The second disc here, I actually left at a friend's house in Glasgow and had to burn a replacement copy, but it doesn't really matter cause I rarely listen to it. There's some good songs for sure, though a lot of live/radio material that feels more like it's there for the sake of completeness than anything else; whereas the bonus material on the two prior reissues is almost entirely essential to the Pavement myth. 'Easily Fooled' is probably the B-side of this era I've loved the most, but it doesn't fit with <i>Wowee Zowee</i> proper, which is still the most valuable thing on here. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Raph from Bordeaux's project is a highly processed approach to electric guitars and drones, with a rich dynamic range from the organic meeting the digital. Sequenced as one long track, there are some deep droney parts that are really beautiful, like a French version of Organum, and other parts that could be an Ashtray Navigations guitar solo. But because he uses a laptop, a lot of people I know won't ever give this guy a chance, even though this record kills half the other stuff out there. [29 Dec 2006]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £0</p>
<p class="p3">This captures Ashtray Navigations just before Ben and I became friends, so now it feels like a strangely familiar document due to my familarity with the musicians on it.  The opening track, 'History of Psychedelia', begins with a weird cut-up tape moment before Ben starts to play the acoustic guitar in that flowery style he was big on at the time.  The track features Andy Jarvis so it may be from the <i>Helvetica is the Perfume of the City</i> sessions.  'Hey Sunflower Motherfucker' is Phil solo, and it's a 10 minute "typical" Ashtray track, though that's not to denigrate it - it's a deep, dense buildup of drone and feedback.  'The Pete Nolan Effect' is Pete and Phil and Mel Delaney and Ben, and it opens with ten minutes of melodies buried under a ridiculous amount of tape hiss - before the proper "jam" comes in, with a flange-heavy distant recording technique.  It starts slowly - very slowly - and over the course of the next twenty minutes it moves little. Pete Nolan is on guitar so it doesn't come in with any thunderous rocking; in fact, it's difficult to determine what, if anything, is "the Pete Nolan effect".  The final track is another twenty minutes of deep dense droning, this time featuring Chris, Alex and Matt Cairns - a weirdo Ashtray/Scatter hybrid that is spooky and foreign-sounding due to the presence of dijiridoo and "magic bouzouki".  Everything is still staticy and crackly, and it's actually quite a gem from the discographies of all of these gentlemen, yet one that is probably forgotten by being buried at the end of a 70+ minute Astray Navigations CD that no one will ever listen to the end of.  Despite the deluxe gatefold CD packaging and the crisp CD sound, Phil made sure to keep enough noise and static on here to show his roots, and if you want a document of what he was doing in 2004-2005 it's probably the best one I've heard.  [12 Jan 2009]</p>

It has the strange, displaced cut-up feeling that his music has and it works really well in it's lo-fi glory. The combined live track doesn't sound live but rather like one processing the other, and then switching off. There's some clattery bits that are probably guitarbased, and then some fluid tape sections with quiet, muffled clanging. [28 Dec 2006]</p>

Among all of the detritus there are some really beautiful moments, even if they're only the barest gestures. The sound palette varies from hissing electronics to plucked strings and piano; the vocals range from falsetto whispers to almost silly groans. Brilliant. [28 Oct 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Three songs from Celesteville that surprised me by being totally straight, accessibile bedroom folk - and really excellent too. Acoustic guitars and casio sound like a recipe for disaster, but Celesteville holds it together and has something weird and manic about his delivery. Dave's Friends and Family project is a bit more obtuse but still fairly song-oriented here - the crackle and hiss makes everything feel fragile, and one has to work a bit harder to experience the songwriting. This is an excellent release. [7 May 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Current Amnesia is Dave Sutton solo, I think, and it appears to be a more "refined" sort of ambient/drone project. The first track hangs in the air forever, suspended by one keyboard drone that dominates the soundsphere, with various activities in the background calling for ones devoted attention. The third track is another immense blast of sound, with electronic pulses pulling each other apart, opening up a middle for exploration. There is an incredible attention to detail here, which makes you wonder why he only bothered releasing this in an edition of 10. [4 Nov 2007]</p>

Other moments attain a communal beauty not unlike the more damaged end of the Jeweled Antler spectrum. There's enough here to probably warrant a vinyl reissue. I'm so excited about all of these guys.

And it's a great album, indeed - lengthy songs, cryptic lyrics, and a rejection of typical HC imagery in favor of a more mystical artwork style - a good way to push the buttons, offering something new by not offering anything new.

There's the usual RIO elements here - quick changing time signatures, complex song structures, and technically dazzling playing. The lyrics overtop are sung in a very post-punk monotone, perhaps the one weak link. But there's a universe of ideas on these 8 songs, which I'm sure will only become more rewarding upon further study. [27 Oct 2007]</p>

King Darves dominates this tape, straddling both sides of it, and his songwriting is solid and his voice is rich and deep; I can only imagine this guy will explode and become super duper famous.

<p class="p1">This is a rather monolithic collection of songs, with vocals buried in reverb until it passes Inca Ore/Grouper territory and becomes a full on wall of sound, with melodies rendered indistinguishable. The guitar playing in the background is stretched to breaking point, at times sounding like a waterlogged 'Song to the Siren'. [14 June 2007] Listened again, and there's some great moments and some awkward ones (like the Leonard Cohen cover) - I think this shows a lot of promise though, and I'd really love to hear a followup.

<p class="p1">After seeing Damien Romero live in London, I think I have trouble with his music. "It's not so much that he's playing a show as much as 'creating a situation'," said the What The ? proprietor to me during said set. This recording from 11 years earlier is similarly dense and horizontal, almost as if Romero is trying to remove the dimension of time from the recording. I wonder what his contributions specifically were to that killer New Blockaders set that I saw; I can't imagine how this approach could gel in a group form so he must be fairly adaptable.

<p class="p1">This is the first "proper" debut of the four-piece lineup, and it takes on a rather fusiony feel, in the first two long pieces. It is very much a group-based recording; Spencer does not dominate the mix so in a sense it's a better group portrait than even The Very Heart of the World. The two shorter pieces at the end forsake the jazz influence for a tense, forced anxiety that is quite compelling. Weird 4AD-style artwork but a great title; in a way this feels almost like the closing of a chapter and the beginning of something new. [29 Nov 2007]</p>

I'll be curious to pull this out in six months or a year and hear how it sounds to me then, but in the pile of Spencer's releases it feels like the least remarkable. [7 Nov 2007]</p>

There are moments of beauty and moments of dissonance, but it's all anchored by a ceaseless, heavy churning. 'Ink Sac' has some reverb-drenched rumbles over which a frantic shenhai loop is layered. 'Hydra' is pure flange jazz - interlocking figures drenched in reverb and effects, building up a menacing aquatic pulse. [27 Oct 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">One long 17-minute song, in several parts, may by Laurent and Charlene's prog masterpieces, recorded with a very close mic and moving from hushed singsong vocals to dark, elliptical drone melodies. There's probably a lot of antecedents for this sound, but the male/female Francophone vibe makes me think of Brigitte Fontaine and Areski. That's not a fair comparison because Laurent and Charlene's sound is thicker, dirtier and darker - there is none of the acoustic lift that I find in Areski's best work. Despite the language barrier I really enjoy this, and I definitely prefer it to the more experimental side of El-G (though there is certainly an experimentalism here). [17 Nov 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">This duo of Laurent and Duncan begins in a quiet, whispery way - a far cry from the Yellow Swansesque battery of their live show in Glasgow. The vocals are wordless, buried in waves of delay and reverb, and shift around in an ambient, slightly disturbing way. Eventually this builds up to a thick buzzing square wave, and then Duncan's guitar solo comes in - I think it's Duncan at least - which is exploratory, rambling, and nervous. It's a great bit of axe-shredding that accelerates as the background drones rise. It's a really explosive sound, with some muffled vocals (maybe sampled) that just kick it into a seriously deranged territory. By the end there's not much place left for my brain. [17 Nov 2007]</p>

The chord progressions remind me of something like Nico, and Laurent's lyrics will be fun to decipher as I'm trying to practice my French. Gotta check out the other one now! [17 Sep 2007]</p>

But this full-length, while hardly a bad album, takes everything down a notch. It sounds a LOT like the Doors, which works if you like the Doors I guess (I'm not a fan). There's some great moments of reverb-drenched guitar psych, but none of the songs rip it up as much as the singles, which will one day be legendary. Luckily, this release comes with a bonus disc collecting them. Maybe I'm not judging the album fairly because I'm comparing it to the singles, but whenever I listen to it, I just want to put the other disc on. [1 Nov 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Gurgling synths, creeping drones, and weird free outbursts - sounds like the recipe of about a million young performers today, sure;; but Lee Rockey's approach avoids any commonplace imagery and instead invents something completely unique. Rockey was a schooled jazz musician, and you can sort of hear it - no sense of technical profieciency is evident, yet the way the sounds interact with each other suggest a deep understanding of improvisational experience. The only real comparison is of course the incomparable sounds of 70's art-damaged experimentalism, NWW-list rumblings, and Futura label scraps. Which is my favorite type of music! [23 Sep 2007]</p>

I dunno. Anyway, this shows the more jazz-oriented side of the Louisvillians (at least in terms of instrument choice) - it screams with horns both atonal and melodic, upright bass propelling everything with an ethnic smirk, and clattering percussion that still holds it together. They sound at times like a cross between Scatter and Bablicon (even quoting one of the most well-known Bablicon riffs, albeit unintentionally I'm sure) - and it makes me think about how I just don't listen to enough music like this anymore.

There are some incredibly beautiful pieces here that stand up against Richard's greatest one-off collaborations (the Youngsbower, the CD with Stephen Todd, Knish, etc.) and once again I find myself feeling that there is yet another brilliant addition to the Youngs canon.

But when viewed as the chance to listen to their songs over and over, it's an opportunity to be seized. Peggy Snow's songs are so incredibly beautiful, especially "The Wind Did Blow", but John Allingham's weird repetitive nursery rhymes are not without their charm (I've had "Rocks and Stones" stuck in my head for weeks now).

This album continues from the greatness of their acoustic EP, even featuring a few songs from it (such as the brilliant, concise "Broken Arm") but has a bunch of new songs to fall in love with. The production is spectacular, recording them just as precisely as they need to be recorded - for this is music where every gesture is very calculated - every breath, every note. This is definitely going to be something I listen to very often, for the songs aren't overtly catchy but offer an intrigue that makes me want to frequently revisit. [15 Oct 2007]</p>

There's still something ramshackle about it, which makes it dwarf the 1990's lame Josef K cover on the other side.

<p class="p1">Alex and Ben's free-form (largely) electric guitar-based rock album is a very strong debut. The fidelity is perhaps the surprising thing - it's so well-recorded that the notes are really allowed to ring out to their full grandeur. While I haven't been enjoying this type of free rock much lately (nor the trad-folk gestures that the last song makes), this is an exception to my mood. Maybe it's because of the recording quality but this feels like Alex moving back towards his work in Scatter, still my favorite output of it. And maybe it's cause I know these guys that I like this so much, but I think it'll hold up for many future listens. [17 Nov 2007]</p>

It's a long disc - probably longer than it needs to be - but it actually stays interesting by shifting to different pieces, recorded (I think) over a long period. Hirofumi is a rad guy and I'm glad he gave me this, because it is a better way for me to remember Defektro than the live experience. [17 Nov 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £10</p>
<p class="p1">On the strength of this record alone, this guy will probably find himself enshrined in the psych hall of fame; it's a blast of dark energy that has the wigged-out vibe of 60's ESP psych while being grounded in post-punk and 1990's indie. The opening cut, "Goodbye", could be a Peter Jefferies/TKOP outtake, with dark acoustic cadences driving the dour lyrical moans. The record doesn't get any brighter, but rather implements canned percussion and scratchy, reverb-laden background haze to further the gloom. The lyrics may at times feel juvenile, but they work really well in the whole scheme of things - the sentiments expressed are extremely real, allowing emotion to sometimes override an artistic aesthetic. "Dead End" shows that a song can be fast-paced yet still soaked in misery - and the final track, "Up the Sleeve," is like a funeral dirge for oneself - the masterpiece at the end of the ladder, or maybe the noose. This has grown to be one of my favorite records of the year, perhaps because I've had some dark times of my own. And given the press and attention this record has received, he'll probably never equal it, cause nothing spoils depressing music like success. [3 Nov 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">At long last, a Sapat vinyl LP emerges - and it's better than I could have possibly imagined. This shows the 'rock' side of Sapat (with the 'jazz' side presumably reserved for the Kark LP) in a very coherent album, showcasing the jam vibe and some killer songwriting as well It's interesting how Sapat works best when the group bands together and focuses, despite being defined by their loose collective nature. There's a zillion more hours of Sapat in Kris's archives, and I wonder if we'll ever hear them all. This is like a synthesis of the few times I saw Sapat, or at least their rock side - and I'm going to treasure it. [3 Nov 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Visitations have left the science-fiction themes of their earlier work, or at least downplayed it a bit. Now they're a straight-up folk band, which isn't nearly as interesting. There's the tendency for these songs to just go on and on and on, a few minutes longer than they need to be - it's only 8 songs, yet feels like an eternity. There's a much higher standard of recording than their first self-titled CD, though that's a detriment here. It lets the voices shine through, but also becomes very dull about mid-way through each song. Small gestures towards rock (track 4) don't help much; it's only on track 7 that the harmonies and textures converge to create something truly psychedelic and beautiful. Maybe this will grow on me, but I prefer the outsider vibe of their first release (even if it's a bit contrived). [5 Nov 2007]</p>

They're so much further away from sounding like a country band here, despite 'Black and Blue Damselfly', an awesome song really. I don't like this sound as much as the earlier stuff, but it would grow on me if I gave it time, for sure - 'Rusty Arrows' and 'Drowning on Dry Land' are classic Alan songs, mixing surreal allegories with a sense of devotion. It's also amazing how little of a presence this band has on the Internet - sometimes I feel like they only exist in Pittsburgh, and these few CDs (all in beautiful embossed cardboard sleeves of course) are the only proof to the outside world.

<p class="p1">My Mekons love is uncritical but I've really liked their direction over the past few albums, which is definitely wimpy adult-contemporary stuff, but with a songcraft that few can equal. The concept behind the title translates into acoustic instrumentation, making this a sequel to <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> if anything. It gets a little amped up with 'Zeroes and Ones', but for the most part it's all relaxed and certainly organic. There's some subdued and beautiful songs here - 'Hope and Anchor', 'Old Fox' and 'Diamonds' are all gems. This won't make any new fans but it's a delight all the way through. The ska-riff structures on <i>Journey</i> appear again, particularly in 'Cockermouth', and I wonder if Mekons actually do this gracefully or if I'm just a fan. For a group that is basically an art collective, their musical output has become quite safe, but they have aged so well that this mellowing is really appreciated. [10 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I just remembered that Cardinal put out a new album this year, their first in 18 years, and I forgot to check it out. This is the way my life is now - because I am not constantly talking about music with people, I have to really make efforts to keep up with this stuff. Not that anyone would ever have talked about Cardinal with me, at any point in my life. This CD reissue came out some years ago, packaged in that thick, nice cardboard cover that looks like a mini-gatefold LP, and it contains a slew of bonus tracks including the entire <i>Toy Bell</i> EP and the other b-sides. This album is a masterpiece, though it's one of the slowest of slow burners - which is maybe why I've never tired of it, and every time I pull it out it's a joyful reunion. I was always under the impression that this was a really balanced collaboration between Davies and Matthews, but actually Richard wrote almost all of the songs apart from the instrumental jams and 'Dream Figure'. This is a relic in ways, from that magical 1994 underground that I was so influenced by, when there was a slew of artists I found that were heavily influenced by 1960s pop (Zumpano for example) while still being "indie" beyond belief. Of course the sophistication of Davies' songwriting gets better with age, and as much as 'Christmas Trees' and 'Big Mink' are the obvious classics, 'You've Lost Me There', 'Silver Machines' and 'Last Poems' are pretty incredible too, and some of his most straight-forward lyrics. The bonus tracks are a nice addition, especially 'Say the Words Impossible'. [22 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">How fucking awesome is it that this soundtrack has been released! It reminds me of watching the film, which I haven't seen in ages, which is to be expected. Separated from Chytlova's incredible visuals, the sound stands on its own as a wonderful carnival of sensation. The song structures are lively and idiosyncratic masterpieces of surrealism; the interludes are great works of juxtaposition, interpersing everyday life sounds with more tonal bits. On top of it all, it's a fantastic pressing, great packaging, and nice liner notes. May this last forever and ever. [15 Dec 2007]</p>

<p class="p1">Thanks Chris!  Chris's solo album was released at a pretty difficult time, and for that reason I put off listeneing to it.  But it's not that painful, besides the cover art.  On vinyl, it sounds amazing - the mastering/pressing is of the highest quality, as the bouzouki really sings with brightest tone imagineable.  His voice has never sounded better; John Cavenagh did a great job of keeping things simple here.  The songs are great, sounding similar enough to keep a coherent theme.  It's more remarkable knowing how things all went so horribly wrong, but I suspect that will really be evident in the new Nalle album.</p>

<p class="p1">Two tracks from original 'classic' FBS lineup of Koulio and Harry, recorded last September.  It sounds like a 'studio' recording or at least a soundboard tape if live.  In a half hour these guys start out with some really small, quiet drones that build to a wall of noise, but without ever actually being noisy or loud.  It reminds me a bit of Heldon in its spacyness.  The second track, 'Melting Your Insides', has a screaming guitar? line looped over everything, slicing through the ringing tones and providing a centre.  This is a really nice and representative recording of Family Battle Snake.  [16 March 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">This collaboration between Koulio and Slash (ha) is based around the sample riff from its namesake, except instead of looping it into an early Steve Reich-styled piece, it lifts into a high, harmonic drone.  It loses sight of GnR for a bit and drifts along for about 20 minutes before coming back down to the melodic riff that set it off.  It's funny seeing FBS veer into 'novelty' territory, but maybe its best to think of it as a plunderphonics cover version kinda things.  [6 April 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Another release from Gaz, this one I think with Sinead as track 1 boasts some vocals that might be hers (but what do I know) around a really demented, echoey song structure.  This is incredibly promising - a real winning track - and the rest of the disc shifts into more horizontal territory, not a bad thing per se but I want to hear more vocals!  Space is an asset, even when buried in reverb.  [12 March 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Phil's now starting to become his own archivist, and with the zillions of tiny releases he's done he can spend the rest of his life chasing his own tail - which is exactly what this disc sounds like.  A murky, mid-fi heavy fuzz guitar dronetone that builds to a crashing crescendo of feedback and bliss, with percussive clanking barely audible behind it - and it continues for a nice long period of time, hypnotic as all of the best Ashtray work but still a bit wild and exploratory.  There's nothing that would make me think this wasn't recorded last week except the date on the cover; this isn't to suggest that Phil hasn't developed in the last 10-12 years but rather that he's been refining his approach and concentrating on what he knows he does best.  [12 March 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Wow Christ HOLY CRAP, this oddly decorated underwater-themed CDr that I bought from Phil turns out to be maybe the best solo Ashtray work I've ever heard!  Track 1 is an absolutely devastating Fushistusha-like dirge with industrial percussion and the Ashtray fuzzdrone, only sounding robotic and evil.  The middle of the disc flits around in various modes but it all seems like a buildup to the final track, a thick soupy wonderfully shoegazery drone that sounds like he's been listening to Seefeel or something.  It's also unusually hi-fi for an Ashtray track but hey - I ain't complaining!  Very very well done and I will pull this one out a lot if I can distinguish it from all the others.

<p class="p1">When Biota comes out with a new album there are probably very few people that rejoice, but I did and I still can't bring myself to properly articulate any thoughts on it.  In some ways this isn't a huge step forward from <i>Object Lesson</i>; it is still very driven by accordion and processed improvisation, vaguely structured into songs but taken apart before they get anywhere.  The vocalisations are significantly less song-oriented than before; there's a lot of jams that start to come together and then instantly start melting thorugh studio trickery or whatever.  It's about an hour long and somewhat of an insane listen, as there's so many musical directions packed into every song that it's really hard to concentrate on anything.  Still, it's another worthy addition to a already strange discography.

A slow burner, perhaps.  [1 April 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Here's a true meeting of minds, a match made in heaven that I've cherished for the past four years. <i>The Breadwinner</i> is explicitly constructed around the concept of domesticity; the sounds here are selected and treated carefully as expected by these two. Lambkin's uniquely singular sound world fits right in with Jason's subtle sense of time and presence. When Lambkin-leaning tracks like 'Listen, the Snow is Falling' are built from creaking, everyday mundanity, pieces like 'E5150/Body Transport' are thick, resonating blankets that offer an ever-escaping centre. 'Lucy Song' has a tender piano core + mumbled confusion that's so incredibly fragile, yet soft, that this contradiction is a good symbol of their overall genius. This album is completely abstract yet so warm, inviting and comforting at the same time, that I feel it's about as close as possible to a perfect merger of 'music' and 'sound art'. There's actually not a lot happening on <i>The Breadwinner</i> - it's more like the spaces between activity that are explored here. These spaces are fuzzy, distant recordings, like aural memories of something we can almost grasp, and it's absolutely captivating if you are so inclined towards sounds like this. Oddly, I've never picked up <i>Air Supply</i>, their second record, but I think I need to immediately. [24 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Exotic electronic synthesisers open this LP, but it's a wet, organic feel despite the inherent alienation of the Idea Fire Company's music. This is a band who creates environments that are somehow alien, yet familiar. The static baths that surround everything make some of the cuts, particularly the title tracks, into a rainforest of obsolete welcoming. You can fixate on any element - the barely audible vocals, the placid ringing tones that float in and out of the sonic horizon, or the trembling uncertainty of the whole. Even the off-kilter interludes - the bumpy juxtapositions between the smoother soundscapes - contain a feeling of the vestigal, the domestic. [25 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Tart's second outing is a much more minor key affair, though of course it is really not in any key.  Here the bouncy rhythms of <i>Radio Orange</i> are slower, more dirgy, and thickened by held down keyboard and Lambkin's own weird Lambkinisms.  The shorter pieces are where they truly excel - it's truly some of the most effective examples of concrète I've heard in ages.  There's much more of an uneasy feeling about this one; maybe this is that "difficult second album" bands are supposed to make.  Everything on this label is pretty incredible and this is no exception.

<p class="p1">You know, the 'anti-natural' manifesto included with this is actually a pretty well-written and intelligent art manifesto. It's a shame that art people don't know anything about experimental music and therefore never noticed this, because it makes a pretty good point about the way we can all have aesthetic experiences and maintain a critical interaction with capitalist life. I guess this is probably the first IFCo record and it's a groundwork for Foust and his weird electronic world -  an anti-musical lake built around sweeping synths and something unsettling yet placid. Maybe not as textured as the later stuff but raw and elegant in its own way. [9 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The last Shadow Ring release has never clicked with me as much as the earlier ones, but listening to it now I feel a real spirit of desolation that speaks heaps to me right now.  Not that I am depressed or anything, but I feel like they really hit on a collective vision for this one, and that's something I appreciate.  This is probably their most minimal record - many tracks are just ambient hums and gurgles, especially "SC DN" which is almost nothing.  Most of the tracks have extremely slowed down vocals - that is, if you play it at 33rpm.  I've never really been sure what speed to play this one at - it works at both, and the voice is slowed down either way so it doesn't really matter.  At 45rpm, the other stuff sounds too fast, especially the beautiful synth loop that is behind "Start Repeating" (a track that sounds closer to Idea Fire Company the Shadow Ring and is probably a more Scott Foust-heavy one). I don't even mourn the end of the Shadow Ring since all of the projects I've heard from them since have been totally amazing- I wonder what Darren Goss has been up to? [3 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">I've listened to the first volume of <i>Just Farr a Laugh</i> probably a hundred times over the years, but the second disc is entirely new to me.  And it's like finding out that there's actually a great album by an artist you love that you've never heard.  It's absurd that Matador sunk money into this project and even more absurd that they wrote a giant booklet of stupid liner notes (which actually kinda detract from the charm of the calls).  But I'm glad they did because it brings this humour to a large audience, if there actually is a large audience that finds something like "Loder's Run: The Quickening" or references to <i>Murphy's Romance</i> funny.  The new disc does not disappoint; it has a few duds as does the first, but there are some great great great calls, like the guy who calls T-Mobile to get a new celphone that will stop women from hanging up on him.  My favorite is still probably the yogurt machine ("Well, tell me about 'em ....") but there's no shortage of yuks.  [16 June 2008]</p>

The voices are strained and silly, the songs come at machine-gun speeds, and it's exactly the kind of thing I love. But I love Renaldo, and Family Fodder, and all of the other post-punk operatives in their wake. This is right alongside them and I'd buy a full-length without hesitating. [19 December 2012]</p>

Antennas Erupt were built around a free-ish jazz group - two saxes, cello and percussion - but with a very direct, fun compositional framework that feels like rock music more often than not. There are some incredibly abrasive, guttural sax solos and a bit of an electronic presence as well, and it's excellently recorded to leave a nice amount of balance and space between everything. The last track is a very angular, tightly composed piece for saxes in counterpoint and it cuts against the party vibe felt elsewhere. I wish there were bands like this around me now.

'Future Junk' by Tyvek is a good, short, discordant song that has guitar leads pulling in strange directions and the best short-attention-span theatrics. It ends with the most annoying locked groove I've ever heard. But I bought this for the Cheveu side, 'El Tortuga', which is, I dunno, "good".

<p class="p1">At £5 I couldn't pass up this reissue of <i>The Freed Man</i>, an album that stands up against the classics of deranged outsider psych/folk.  Most people only know an abridged version of this album that ended up on CD, but I had a dub of the LP in high school so I grew to really love the weirdness within, even if I didn't like the more tuneless diversions.  This record is so fragile and fractured and it wears its soul on its sleeve, yet it's wild and druggy and unstable.  It completely blows away all other Sebadoh that followed except for maybe <i>III</i> which is awesome too except for the Jason Lowenstein songs on it.  But there's no Lowenstein here; it's just Gaffney and Barlow, and they are presented as equals as opposed to the usual Lou dominance (see <i>Weed Foresting</i>).  This actually adds on the tracks from the <i>Magic Ribbons</i> 7" box set, which I dubbed from Weird Paul at the peak of my Sebadoh-mania (there was a time when Nick Sarno and I had a printout of Lou Barlow's complete discography and we were obsessed with hearing every single song. Getting a copy of those songs from Paul was a major coup in this quest, which ended at the time <i>Harmacy</i> came out and Sebadoh sunk into being just another boring rock band, one that I didn't even like anymore.  I was too young to realise that Eric Gaffney was the best thing about Sebadoh).  Anyway, those songs are amazing, and the stuff that didn't end up on the original LP is amazing too.  I should have bought the vinyl version of this but it was £10 more and I know I'm going to go back and buy it at some point anyway.  [28 July 2008]</p>

Though it probably draws comparisons to a lot of noise/drone music due to personal associations, the closest thing sonically to something like the Skaters is the fidelity.  Yet the electric guitar cuts through and plays these wonderfully slow, bending pyschedelic riffs.  The compositions are strong but my favorite parts are when it becomes kind of dubby, with weird keyboard patterns and oscillating rhythms.  I wrote how a lot of people are saying Burning Star Core's <i>Challenger</i> is a "high water mark" from this scene; well this is a record I could see going down as an all-time cult great, maybe still being talked about in 10-15 years.  Of course time will tell; I'll try not to wear it out in the meantime.  [4 Aug 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Dodos are an indie-pop band with sweet, sunny melodies and frantically strummed acoustic guitar over frantic, lively drumming.  For some reason I was quite taken by this when I heard it.  It's musically a simple formula, yet there's quite a lot to listen to.  The percussionist is so incredibly good that it makes it sound like there's 10 people making a big swirling ball of sound, but they're just a two piece (though surely aided with some overdubs).  The lyrics are straightforward and the songwriting teeters on the edge of being cloying and singsong, like some crummy twee band - except it all clicks.  This record is serioulsy great.  There's some very short interlude-style pieces in between more fleshed out songs, and I love that sketchy quality.  Though it's a double LP it doesn't drag on, and there's an incredible song "Ashley" near the end that sustains my interest.  I don't pay attention to music like this much anymore but it's a style that I grew up with and something I really do have a soft spot for.  [28 July 2008]</p>

<p class="p1">Giant Tank vinyl! This is a meeting of some true weirdos. Side A is live from Instal 2006, a performance which I was certainly there for though I don't remember that clearly. It's built around vocals, obviously, with Dylan and Karen's more alien sounds juxtaposed with Ludo's babbling hysterics. Ludo is such a product of another time; his vocalising here reminds me of old Aktonist-style performance artists and the grand theatre of European insanity in the 1970s (more like a stereotype I have instead of any concrete examples). The electronic processing is there but minor; the end sounds like a giant swarm of bees. The B-side contains three tracks where Blood Stereo processed source material Ludo sent to the, and it's much more electic, full of tiny gestures and awkward spaces. There's points where Blood Stereo really take over and it sounds like their stuff, with Ludo thudding along. I played a set with Ludo once that Jelle released as a tape and I always thought he was a wonderful, sweet, insane man. I never picked up his film music LP but I bet it's also wonderful, sweet and insane. [18 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Newbury by the mid-70s had definitely eked out a career but there's not really anything more upbeat on this record than his first one. It's produced with a somewhat more hands-on production, containing the full studio treatment. But his confessional, sparse singing style is still evident and this is a great downer trip. 'You Only Live Once in Awhile' might stand out as my pick, being fit for Tom Waits to deliver, but 'Love Look (At Us Now)' is also commendable for it's sophistication. Sometimes everything slows down and he just picks a few arpeggiated notes, and it's a stunning effect, while still fitting comfortably into the genre of country and western ballads.

It recalls the spare arpeggiated medleys on <i>Looks Like Rain</i>, sung with the same dour drawl. Newbury's a master of slow, depressed regret; whether it's acoustically plucked guitar or piano, it's helped along with some string arrangements which are never overbearing. 'Remember the Good' is an updating of 'I Don't Think About Her No More' and while the lyrics occasionally veer into such sad-sack territory that I want to slap him and say "knock it off!", it's also exactly what I'm in the mood for some times. <i>Looks Like Rain</i> was definitely the one that got me into his work but this one is almost as strong.

But then there's the problematic title track and 'Union Man' which feels pandering and lazy. And the album overall is short and has a throwaway feeling. As I've never gotten into <i>Trans</i> and in general, have never heard anything post-<i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> that even holds a candle to the 70s work, this feels a bit like the last great gasp, and it's not even that great.

<p class="p1"><i>Hounds of Love</i> is so widely known in the UK that it was shocking to friends when I moved to the UK with no familiarity of it or any of Bush's work. After living a few years in Scotland I became intensely familiar with this, not just from my flatmate's constant playing (he cites it as his favourite album of all time, which is a good choice) but from the general pop culture presence of it - a rare feat for a record 25 years old. Side one of this is packed with hits, which hold up well - I would say "despite the 80s production" but actually said production is exactly part of the charm. 'Hounds of Love' is as infectious and brilliant as anything; 'Cloudbursting' is an epic, driving hit. But it's the B-side of this album, subtitled <i>The Ninth Wave</i>, where the real magic lies. Apart from 'Jig of Life', this is mostly slower and less catchy songs, but it's where Bush really tries out some ideas. I've written before about the subtle key change in 'Watching You Without Me' but it hits me everytime as pure beauty, yet pure simplicity. The lyrics are definitely in a realm of foggy English mysticism, but Bush is confident and delivers everything with a brash brilliance, whether she's 'Waking the Witch' or 'The Big Sky'. Sometimes records are deserving of commercial success; this is one of them, and it's also amazing that something so adventurous can also find such a large audience. [8 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Thunderclap Newman's lone album is a bit of an anomaly in rock music, led by a former Who roadie; they were a one-hit wonder but this album is an impressive piece of British pop-rock, a bit early for glam but certainly leaning in that direction. This is far from a giant buildup to 'Something in the Air', though that track, appearing last, is certainly majestic; there's other great jams throughout, performed well with a punch. 'When I Think' is a rolling ballad and the cover of 'Open The Door, Homer' from <i>The Basement Tapes</i> is nice too. Pete Townsend plays bass and he's the svengali of the group, but I think they're better than the Who, personally. The theme of Hollywood is cast as a wistful, nostalgic view-from-abroad fantasy which really works to drive the record. This reissue has a weird cover but I kinda like it; it came shrinkwrapped as well. [22 November 2012]</p>

I was impressed and therefore happy to upgrade to the vinyl years later when I randomly came across it at Jerry's. Iran were from California, I think, and took a slightly more slow, stoned approached to <i>Faust Tapes</i>-style art-rock collage. There are aborted, discordant folk fragments, instrumental drone jams, space-rock pastiches and an emphasis on the record as a whole instead of the individual parts. The experimentalism never takes over and threatens to derail it, though I of course love this type of balance. They remind me of a less folk-centered Tower Recordings, except far, far stronger and consistent than Tower Recordings ever were. I know they put out a few more albums but I think Iran's destined to remain in obscurity, a real shame for such a brilliant band. [18 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Kate Bush's predecessor to <i>Hounds of Love</i> is actually the better record to me, with a bit more adventure and less commercial overtures. Not that a favourite must be picked, because both are masterpieces. This has a few songs that I go back to repeatedly, most notably 'Suspended in Gaffa' and the title track, a uniquely bizarre vision that only could have come from Bush. Her love of big synth textures, boldly artificial percussion, and thick-tracked vocals was perfect for 1982 and because it's supported by such visceral, invigorating songwriting, it really really works. These are songs about confusion, perception, sensations, other people, and despite trying to write about the topic, love; it's a confident step from a singular vision, and a sort of penultimate truth before her smash commercial breakthrough.

And while the pressing is thin it's great to hear this slow misery unfold on wax. "I Don't Think About Her No More" is a brilliant bit of dishonesty and even the more upbeat genre filler like 'T. Total Tommy' has a charm. Luckily, the live album is stripped down and slow too - just Mickey and his guitar. The material isn't quite as strong, though 'She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye' closes it to great fanfare. The recording is intimate and when he's being straightforward, it's great, a bit like John Prine crossed with Townes Van Zandt. The only lesser spots are the songs like 'Heaven Help the Child', attempts to be an everyman Guthrie/Ochs character, which is not his strength. But this was a definitely nice pickup to have, and <i>Looks LIke Rain</i> is enough to justify the "expensive" cost (for Jerry's, at least when I shopped there regularly). [18 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Twelve years in the making, this double LP by Prisonshake is a stunning masterpiece of American rock music.  With a lovely, occult-influenced gatefold cover this looks like its going to be a Current 93 album.  Instead, it's an explosive, somewhat angry guitar-rock album that's recorded to the utmost level of perfection.  There's different song titles on the labels than on the sleeve, so it's a bit confusing - plus the booklet has some hilarious pictures of fake former releases, suggesting that this band likes their sarcasm.  Lyrically there's a fairly serious approach, with relationship-centered lyrics and none of the surrealism of my other Ohio/Scat fave, Robert Pollard ... but it gels so well it's hard to believe this was assembled from a zillion different sources.  There's some angular, crushing guitar riffs and the 80's indierock infuence that I imagine was big when this band formed - but then a few songs have that slower, slightly calmer feel.  "The Understudy" reminds me of Hurl; actually, this whole album reminds me of that style of indie rock that was popular in Pittsburgh when I started going to shows - Karl Hendricks, Hovland, that WRCT sound - the difference being that years later when I'm removed from that scene, this record sounds like an instant classic in a way that those bands never did.  I'm really surprised by how much I like this album - the all-analog recording is just so impressive that it's honestly a pleasure to listen to it, especially on my new turntable.  I should investigate their back catalog, though there's a lot to digest here first (and very little filler).

<p class="p1">I used to dream of having all the early Scritti Politti material collected into one release, and alas, Rough Trade responded to this fantasy. These first singles are so naive, energetic, and ragged; they continue to be a source of inspiration 30 years later. Some of these songs - 'Hegemony', 'Messthetics', 'Scritlocks Door' - should be ranked among the greatest ever British punk/post/whatever songs - certainly as much a cornerstone of this movement as the Homosexuals or Desperate Bicycles. That SP went into a very pop direction later probably hurts their legacy, but if you only had this record to base it on, they'd be proper legends. [24 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Julian takes a lot of time between Music Tapes releases -- by the time this came out, I didn't know he was still actively recording at all, and my own connection to these people has long withered away. But I still bought it on faith and never really listened to it, which is a shame, cause there's some really beautiful melodies here. Mr. Koster may be an acquired taste but I've always loved everything he's done, because it masquerades extreme sadness as cute and fey. This is recorded on very old sound equipment, with the usual gang of suspects helping out, but it's still very much about Julian's vision. The giant song-cycle feel of his first album isn't so obvious; instead, we get some simple, strummy songs. His voice is earnest and cracks at times, just like back in the Chocolate USA days, and I now (listening for the first time since I bought it) think I should dive into it deeper. And, surprise, he has a new record out this year! [24 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">This is two tracks that are really three.  The first is made of two parts, of which the first, 'The Ripple Children', is a full-on assault of tape manipulations of (I assume) Warmer Milks improvisations, probably assembled by Mikey solo to explain the 'Kentuckee Pong Tapes" credit.  It's actually pretty great at these things go, and it merges nicely into 'The Jaunting' which is a dirt-rock riff fest sounding like the darkest SST hangover.  The longest section of this disc is 'The Wanderer', which is a freaked out guitar and bass argument, heavily affected and sounding like a really really bad time.  The title is probably apt because while it steps all over the place (there's moments that remind me of Dr. John while others that sound like something from Ralph Records) it never sets forth in a definite direction.  There are vocals buried there too but they're processed beyond any recognition.  If you like the acoustic, soft side of the Milks this is definitely an album to stay away from, but as their more strident rock experiements go, this is a keeper.</p>

<p class="p3">It's hard for me to write about Warmer Milks because even though I know them, have seen them a bunch of times, heard tons of recordings and even played a little bit with them, I still don't understand what Mikey is doing.  If WM can be distilled to one philosophy, maybe it's that they are perpetually changing direction.  <i>Soft Walks</i> is masterfully recorded, beautifully produced, and on the surface appears to be their most accessible record.  It's guitar-driven, with lots of acoustic instruments, huge ambience (feeling like the band is jamming inside of a barn), more conventional verse/chorus structures, and few experimental diversions (though there are some strangely psychedelic, electronic parts that feel as natural as the rest of the record).  Yet, like Mayo Thompson's <i>Corky's Debt to His Father</i>, it feels like Mikey's weirdest record yet (despite being the most accessible).  The songs are languid, and they unfold to portray a vision that is almost-human, but distant enough to prevent me from connecting to it.  Like everything else by WM, I don't really feel like this is something I would listen to repeatedly (or ever again).  But it also has a million years of rewards buried in the cracks - gestures, silences, and hidden meanings that will emerge after one finally has some familiarity with it.  Maybe.  This could end up becoming my favorite record ever, but something tells me it will remain obtuse and distant.  This is the Warmer Milks M.O. I think, and I like when clues are buried and the reader must dig them up. Whether anyone will make the time to go on this treasure hunt remains to be seen. [19 Feb 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">With 52 tracks and almost 80 minutes, it's really incredibly difficult to make it through <i>Teenage Hallucination: 1992-1999</i> in one go. But as a personal document, it's unsurpassed - and as quality 'noise' music, it's also remarkable. The sounds that come of this disc for the most part hurt my ears, at least at high volumes, yet they're crafted with a sense of purpose lacking in the majority of noise artists I've encountered. The liner notes are funny - the guy from Hijokaidan wrote something quite heartfelt about John's work, and then Seymour Glass contributes something surreal - but both remark on how solid and consistent Wiese has been his entire career. For a teenager to make noise this coherent is actually more incredible than it looks and his subsequent development of a kinetic, highly edit-based aesthetic follows from this. I can't confess to having made it all the way to track 52, but I deeply appreciate what's here. [31 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've never been completely fair to Will Oldham, often dismissing his more adventurous experiments even though had a different artist attempted such things, I would be more supportive. The man has certainly been virtuous, though maybe not consistent. Alex Neilson used to argue with me that this was the worst Oldham album and he couldn't understand why it was the only one I ever wanted to listen to - this was when he was playing drums for Oldham and inevitably having to learn how to play some of these tunes. Anyway, I go back to this one constantly because it's simplicity and honesty is what elevated it to classic status. Actually, I've been listening to all the records under the Palace monikers recently. This is a guy, sitting on his porch, playing his guitar and singing a perfect set of songs. Maybe 'I Send My Love To You' lacks the pathos or tragedy found in his more developed work, but it still brings me to my knees. The songs I used to skip over, like 'Come a Little Dog', are the ones I enjoy the most now, perhaps because I've worn them out less. When I sing along with 'I Am a Cinematographer', I feel a truth in the delivery that is rarely found in other artists's work. 1994 was the golden era for me, and I have no idea why I'm writing so defensively about this masterpiece.

<p class="p1">Oldham's last great gasp as Palace, <i>Viva Last Blues</i> is a pretty complete picture of indie-country longing. It doesn't hold back from being strange or difficult, but at the same time has a full rock sound for most of it. This band, which features Jason Loewenstein from Sebadoh, is languid, yet crisp - this is probably the record that best captures that Palace 'band' feeling the way I idealise it. For all the encounters with death and having intercourse with mountains on here, I think Oldham is at his best when we can relate. 'New Partner' is the masterpiece, the song I've practically worn out of the vinyl; the ending acoustic songs are likewise masterful, a 90's updating of Big Star <i>Third </i>and a beautiful way to end.

<p class="p1">This was the first Smog record I got into, and still my favourite. Actually it's just one of my favourite records.  It's the perfect bridge between the noisy, home-taping madness of his first records and the more mature, depressing acoustic work of his mid-period, and really the beginning of a series of masterpieces that runs through <i>Wild Love</i> and <i>Doctor Came at Dawn</i>.  The desperation is extreme and even teenage, but there's moments of a totally unique fractured beauty on songs like 'Your Wedding' and 'Chosen One'.  'A Lou Reed - <i>Mistrial</i> stick in the mud' is an amazing lyric, and while these songs are inherently hard to empathise with, I've really grown up with this record, ever since Mark Monakey dubbed it for me when I worked at the Carnegie Library in 1997.  [17 July 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">Label: Drag City</p>
<p class="p1">Format: Vinyl LP</p>
<p class="p1">Source: Drag City mailorder</p>
<p class="p1">Cost: $10</p>
<p class="p1">Stitch after stitch, I keep returning to <i>The Natural Bridge</i>. I first dubbed this from someone back in '96, when I was still in high school. I recorded it from my parents Dual turntable that played things slightly too fast, so the tape I committed to heart was always a tad higher-pitched than it should have sounded, which I didn't realise until years later. Over time this has risen to a very high place in my personal pantheon, along with <i>Starlite Walker</i> and <i>American Water</i>; it's silly to keep revising a 'favourite bands of all time' list but Silver Jews are certainly among them, top 5, top 3, whatever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So writing about <i>The Natural Bridge</i> is more writing about how I grew up with this album; I've now spent half of my life with it. (Whoa.) Berman's indie-country mix is idiosyncratic and the power and meaning I've read into it says more about me than the music. To be honest, this record probably had a huge influence on my own sense of poetry and lyricism, along with other teenage touchstones like Neutral Milk Hotel; a difference is that I continually return to this while I've left most of the others behind, and there's something more direct and connective in the SJ lyrics than I get from, say, GbV (another artist I've listened to obsessively for the recent half of my life).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An advantage of more "honest" lyrics vs. surrealism is that as I get older (and subspace grows colder) there's more to connect with than ever. It's Leonard Cohen syndrome - these lyrics make more sense to me the older I get, as I've had my own experiences with love, loss, failure, misery and self-doubt. And Berman's lyrics aren't even that direct - I'm the one reading my own life story into 'little glowing cumbuckets in her ankles', after all - but this is the beauty of the country-fried indie aesthetic. It suggests a universalism, a familiarity, through it's motifs and tropes, even if it's manufactured. And this works for me. It's never struck me at any point that Berman's style is disingenuous - it seems logical, the necessary progression of righteousness from <i>The Arizona Record</i> onward.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I remember my first ever "girlfriend", Ailecia, putting 'Pet Politics' on a tape at the time - actually I think she titled her annual mixtape 'Pet Politics', which at the time was a song I tended to skip over. Now I crumble every time I listen to it; it's probably (along with 'We Are Real') my favourite Berman song ever, and there may never be a better opening line (or line, full stop) than "Guard my bed / while the rain turns the ditches to mirrors". Despite all of Berman's affectations and the one-liner style of his songwriting, his pleading repetition of 'Please guard my bed' at the end of this song is among the most emotionally powerful and connective things I've ever heard in rock music. And despite a few tracks that are less than perfect (which all three of these albums share), and all the dumb jokes (in 'The Frontier Index', actual straight-up jokes), and the use of session musicians instead of the Malkmus/Nastanovich core, <i>The Natural Bridge </i>as a whole is far, far greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lost Malkmus/Bobby N sessions are probably the Holy Grail of indie rock for me, though I sort of hope I never hear them. I don't need <i>The Natural Bridge</i> to be any different than it is. I used to mishear the lyric "the way water drips" and "the way water <i>drifts</i>" which maybe was an improvement, but the imperfections are part of the magic. [9 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $12</p>
<p class="p3">I loved <i>The Natural Bridge</i> and still do; when this follow-up was released (I remember hearing it at WPTS) I was really disappointed and dismissed it.  When I was living in Kentucky, seven years later, i went back to it and fell in love with it; I now consider it as solid as the other two in the great Triumvirate (with <i>TNB </i>and <i>Starlite Walker</i>).  Of course I was just listening to MP3s I've downloaded (which I've probably listened to a zillion times since 2005) so when I placed this much-overdue catchup order to Drag City, I ordered the whole triumvirate.  Listening now, probably the first time I've ever heard this album on vinyl, it sounds wonderful and full as only vinyl can sound.  If the story of the Silver Jews has been the slow progression from utter ramshackle madness to professional polish, then that would explain why I love these three albums - they're the perfect midpoint between those two extremes.  And actually, though this came after <i>TNB</i> it's actually (slightly) closer to the ramshackle side, probably due to Malkmus.  There's a new confidence that greatly benefits the material, and also this probably has the least filler of any Silver Jews album. </p>
<p class="p3">The funny thing, with Berman, is how he can write these weird, almost jokey images that totally give the finger to all of my established ideas of good taste: puns, cracked metaphors, clichéd Americana .. and then, for some reason these lyrics often make me shiver, magically, rather than cringe in embarassment.  I feel like just quoting all of the brilliant lyrics on this record here, but it's not just the one-liners or the melodies - it's the overall feel, the rhythm and the way it can feel so fucking 'genuine' when someone sings a lyric like "and the NASCAR blurred into porn".  But it's not just those "clever" lyrics that affect me, for there are some classically beautiful songwriting moments here too: "The kids in the court are all covered in dirt / they were caught trespassing under the moon"; "I wrote a letter to a wildflower / on a classic nitrogen afternoon"; I'll stop now but the record is dripping with them.</p>
<p class="p3">Berman's America isn't really my America of course; it's the America I think I'm from.  And I don't live in either one at the moment, so it doesn't take much. The fact that I listened to this so much that summer of 2005, when I was finding my way through Kentucky and about to depart for the UK, indelibly binds this record to some "important" personal moment.  <i>The Natural Bridge</i> stuck with me too, of course, from my Senior year of high school to the present - the tape I dubbed from Rob Berthold's LP on my parents stereo, set to run just slightly too fast so I still find the actual album to be a bit slower than I got used to it ... but that's material for the review of that album.  But what I was getting at is that I am still so closely stuck to the music that I equate with nostalgic moments - Pavement, GBV, <i>The Natural Bridge</i>, His Name is Alive - those were the sounds of my life during those turbulent times of adolescence and University.  Those records have lyrical/conventional themes that, whatever they may actually mean, are easier to stick to than the predominantly abstract, experimental, and often non-Western or instrumental sounds that have dominated my life since college.  So of course I love what I love, but going into my late 20s theres certainly been less records I click with on that deep, emotional level for the above reasons (plus the general jadedness of being slightly older, plus the overall influx of every sound imaginable thanks to the Internet).  When I found <i>American Water</i> in 2005, it was easy because it was a band I already loved two other records by, and it stroked those same feelings that I never thought would be stroked again. (Berman's recent records sure ain't doing it). [3 Jan 2009]</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Starlite Walker</i> is beautiful and ragged. It's balanced perfectly between the country-fried polish of <i>The Natural Bridge</i> and the anarchic sounds of <i>The Arizona Record</i>. Some of Berman's most free moments are here - 'Tide to the Oceans', and the mostly spoken 'Country Diary of a Subway Conductor'. But the genius is evident, even if it's sparse. Despite the millions of times I've listened to 'New Orleans' and 'Trains Across the Sea', it still stirs me; 'The Silver Pageant' is still simple instrumental magic to my ears. This is a cornerstone for me. [16 December 2012]</p>

'Loss/Grief/Perishableness' is the opening cut, which is 18 minutes of unfolding electroacoustic drone experimentation, very much in the genre that Ikuisuus releases often are (thinking here about Uton, Kulkija, things like that). It's beautifully rendered, with small bells and all acoustic sources, and some field recordings woven in as well. Track two, 'Impermanence/Emptiness', contains a lot of singing, essentially a 15 minute folk song built around a clean-channel electric guitar strum, with swirling organ drones around the high-pitched, backwards-sounding singing. It's beautiful, somehow tying together influences of  obscure singer-songwriter psychedelia and the contemporary underground dronescape. [24 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I bought this on eBay because it's the Japanese edition with bonus tracks, and I was so desperate to hear them.  I couldn't find them anywhere on Soulseek or blogs or the usual sources, so I started watching eBay for a CD, which I never do.  But let me tell you - it's completely worth it.  The booklet appears to be the standard Flydaddy booklet and the only mention of the bonus tracks comes from the little Japanese insert.  But I've never owned this album properly, so the lyric sheet alone is almost worth the $25 - it is the codex to unlocking the mysteries of these songs which I have misinterepreted for so long.  And the Japanese insert has lyrics for the bonus tracks, in English!!  But anyway, the bonus tracks!  The demo versions are largely acoustic, sung more clearly, and maybe a bit slower.  "Transcontinental" is every bit as awesome as the rocking version; "Chips Rafferty" has some nice piano tinkling.  "Topple into my Fantasy" suffers a bit without the plodding drums, but you can tell Davies composed it with space left for them. But the main reason I wanted this CD is for the live version of "Cars for Kings Cross".  It's hard to pick a favorite song from <i>Instinct</i> but this would probably be it.  Hearing a rough live version is great, even if it's kinda rough, kinda silly - the full band kicks in for the "riff" and it sounds kinda heavy metal.  It sounds like someone is singing backup in the band but they don't do the offset vocals on the "25 minutes down..." verse.  Still, I can only dream of seeing the Moles perform these songs live so this takes me a bit closer to my dream.  Oh yeah, there's also live version of 'Already in Black' and 'If You Believe in Christmas Trees' which makes me think these could be from live Cardinal gigs, and maybe that is Matthews singing backup.  The 'Already in Black' is thrashy as hell with some screaming, barking lyrics - a rocking side of the Moles that doesn't really come across on record.  Davies sings so deep on 'Christmas Trees' that maybe it actually is Mathews, I dunno.  His trademark accent sounds buried.  I don't know what I've done to frighten everyone.  For the coda, the "Should I really say..." part, the drums drop out and it's just sung over strummed electric guitar, which works really well in the live band context.  Now I just need a copy of <i>Instinct</i> - I've been waiting for vinyl, but that may be impossible to find, so I should probably just get the CD.  I should also write one of those 33 1/3 series books about that album.  Anyway, the album is already amazing and brilliant and these bonus tracks are pretty much better than I could have hoped for, so i can be buried happy.</p>

<p class="p1">Daniel's last solo record, I think, though I haven't really kept up, was recorded when I lived in Glasgow with him - or at least around the time I lived with him. I listen to this and feel a strong similarity to this and the music I was making at the time, which isn't surprising. With Daniel's there's different instrumentation and a reliance on vocal manoeuvres that I'd never have, but I think we both have really similar approaches. It's funny also listening to the instrumentation here that I remember just lying around the kitchen, etc. There's a less discordant, more folky feel than <i>The Isaac Storm</i> which I think suits the labels appropriately. The empty sketches here - by which I mean the melodic fragments that begin and end without figuring themselves out - are actually some of my favourite parts. It ends with a different version of 'English Again', the little tune at the beginning the first One Ensemble CD from way back when. I think Daniel knocks out these solo albums to let off steam and doesn't consider them as 'important' as the One Ensemble releases, but I actually might prefer them in ways. There's a lot of gestures here - the scrapes between tracks, pure atmospheres, and of course the fragmentary nature - that are right up my alley. [27 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A blast of neo-punk fun, 'Which Way is Up?' has energetic guitars, earnest vocals, and it's over in an eyeblink. 'Falling Again' is slightly longer but no less lively.

<p class="p1">Cost: €0</p>
<p class="p1">'I Lie Awake' is a perfect little song, with an upbeat, driving rhythm, and brittle guitar hooks around the low-mixed, amateurish vocals. It's over in a heartbeat, but it leaves me wanting more. There's two equally brief songs on the B-side, the latter of which hangs on big guitar chords and open, plodding basslines. Cause Co-Motion so perfectly balance the simple with strong pop song construction - they're probably much more aware of what they are doing then they let one. At times I think of a less 'punk' Eat Skull, but that's probably cause both remind me of early Flying Nun bands so much. [10 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I always forget about this 7" but it's the best Pink Reason release outside of the first LP (oh, and also 'Down On Me' which is an awesome song). 'Winona' is a miserable, slow, quiet downer folk tune. 'Give Yerself Away' is a strummy, somewhat tuneless song and 'Letting Go' has a bluesy edge. This is probably the most depressed Pink Reason release, even moreso than <i>Cleaning the Mirror</i>, and that's why I like it. [1 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £11.99</p>
<p class="p1">This may sound silly, and maybe I will regret writing these words in ten years, but I think <i>Blood Visions</i> belongs in any "top 5 punk rock records of all time" list ( that is inevitably made by list-type music fans). I try so hard to not be one of those fans yet I'm constantly saying that such and such is my favourite album or song by an artist. I got into this record during the end of my Glasgow residency and don't you know, it made me feel young again. But that's not all - this is timeless, amazing music that can communicate to a 14 year old and also to a 32 year old who was once 14. While I hear so much contemporary music now and feel completely old and dated, this speaks to every bit of me still. I listened to the shit out of this around the time I moved to Helsinki, which culminated in the last live concert I've attended where I jumped up and down, sang along, and knew all the words. I guess I was 28 then and when he played 'My Shadow' I thought I was going to explode into a ball of fiery excitement. I feel no sympathy for Mr. Reatard and I didn't even really care much for the rest of his output; well, the two singles collections hold up pretty well but the last album was weak and I already stopped thinking about him. But pulling this out now, it's hard not to crank it and jump up and down and get excited. As juvenile as 'Greed, Money, Useless Children' may sound on paper, it still means something to me, even if there are a lot of layers. And there's such an incredibly appreciation of great 60's pop and mod music in his songwriting that you can't get hooks like "Oh/It's such/a shame" out of your head, or "I/keep searching for you". Simplicity wins in the end and this will endure forever, far longer than Mr. Reatard's own time on this earth. [1 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've listened to this Blank Dogs record a lot over the past few years but it's always been a sort of 'easy listening' for me. The dark, edgy bedroom post-punk sound was very much in my radar back in 2008, though Blank Dogs is much more influenced by artists like Magazine, whereas Cheveu (for example) have a much more manic and experimental edge. There are great tunes here - 'The Crystal Ladies' for example, has a sort of earnestness that I don't hear much elsewhere on the record - but I never kept up with his prolific output. It's not a pure retro exercise - the recording, while fairly lo-fi, sounds contemporary - nothing made in 1980 would have had this mood exactly. But I can't quite articulate why this is. Sometimes the casio-beat percussion is really driving and I will get lost in the back-and-forth monotony; credit where it's due to this guy for using cheap instrumentation very very well.

[2009]  Broadcast are one of those bands that's grown, over time, to become a favourite of mine, but sort of accidentally.  I've always liked them - back to high school/early college, with <i>Work and Non-Work</i> and then <i>The Noise Made by People</i> which Caleb and I used to jam a ton back in the college days.  The thing is, I never really remember to think about them and their music always felt slightly disposable to me - just because it never wedged into my brain and I never learned the words and I never made a personal meaninful connection to it.  But somehow, that has to change.  <i>Tender Buttons </i>is probably the one that will do it for me too.  I just totally love this fucking record.  It's solid, and concise - short, pop-based songs that do all the Broadcast things, just really well.  It's nice to actually have the CD booklet because the lyrics are presented in a scattered, slipshod way but it totally works.  There's just the right balance of sketchy abstractness and conveyed meaning in these words, and the music is somehow clean, futuristic and archaic all at once.  There's a few standout tracks - 'Black Cat', 'Tears in the Typing Pool', 'Michael a Grammar' - but I've never overall fixated on particular songs, just the overall feel of the album.  But I think this listen tonight, which has got me in a perfect mood, has me determined to sink deeper into Broadcast's ouvre (a difficult task being that I feel overwhelmed by all the other things I have to listen to).  Ultimately, <i>Tender Buttons</i> makes me want to start writing pop songs again myself; that something created inspiration is probably one of the best endorsements it can get.  [27 April 2010]</p>

<p class="p3">This is the soundtrack to an exhibition at the CCA that happened after I left Glasgow but i wish I had seen it.  Here, instead of Mark and Barry doing their usual cut-up/vaudeville/dada weirdness they work with other musicians - Sarah Kenchington, Katy Dove, and Belinda Gilbert Scott.  The whole album is a story, narrated by Wendy Woolfson, and while I didn't follow the text closely, it has a fairy-tale like, dreamy feel.  The music consists of quiet abstractions, using a lot of bells and chimes.  Any unusual sound sources are so well integrated into the overall vibe that they don't feel weird or anything - just like it's part of a coherent whole.  I assume Mark and Barry cut up the recordings quite a bit and reassembled them, but it feels a million miles away from the stuff we did with them.  It's a really unified vision, and quite restrained for them (but really great that they are working with other people, and really letting them shine).  The last track, a bonus track, is a more typical Boy Band Tax Returns-sounding mishmash but it's good too.  [11 Feb 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">This record may be in my all-time top ten - certainly among the scores of "lost psych classics" that have surfaced over the past few years, this is the cream of the crop.  This is a nice 180g vinyl reissue of questionable legitimacy, but I'm just happy to have it.  It doesn't sound amazing - I could hear a bit of distortion in 'Lullaby', though my stylus and the vinyl looked perfectly clean.  But, again, I'll take it - the bootleg MP3s I listened to for years were even shittier sounding, and the end of 'St. Nicholas Hall' actually cut off.  So, what to say about this record, apart from the fact that all fans of creative, catchy psychedelic music should hear this?  Judy Henske wrote all of the lyrics and Jerry Yester wrote all of the music (and I think plays every instrument, cause there's no other credits here), and the partnership is magical.  The gatefold has a wonderfully disgusting paisley background but prints the lyrics in a somewhat unreadable font, and it's awesome to be able to read these strange, beautiful songs, which work as poetry without the tunes.  But what tunes they are!  'Lullaby' begins with the premise that "The end of the world is a windy place," and Henske tends towards apocalyptic imagery in the best possible way - shaking off any vestiges of 60's hippiedom for a more strident vision.  'Farewell Alderbaran' is a dark, intense paen to a comet; 'Rapture' and 'Three Ravens' are beautiful yet with a powerful gravitas to them.  The only dud on the whole record is 'Mrs. Connor', aka 'One More Time', sung by Yester, but it's not even that bad.  And it's wedged between the AMAZING 'Raider' and 'Rapture', so it's a pardonable offense; blink and you miss it.  What else can I say?  'Snowblind' is dark psych with a pounding, funky evil edge; 'Horses on a Stick' is infectious bubblegum, and 'St. Nicholas Hall' is such a brilliant, epic fucking song I don't even know what justice I can do it with my words.  It's funny that I'm only getting around to reviewing this now because about 3 years ago I was completely obsessed with it and listened to it every day.  Now, it's like a familiar friend, but it never stops sounding amazing.  This is one of the most essential documents of American rock music in the 1960s, if not the most essential; any of you other agents who might be reading this should go out and buy this now, as I give it the highest possible recommendation.  [9 July 2010]</p>

This is a great example of Sun Ra's distinct approach to avant-garde jazz - it's not easy to categorise, as it's miles away from NYC loft blow-out stuff but then far more visceral and psychedelic than something Roscoe Mitchell or Anthony Braxton would compose. Great artwork too, which puts Sun Ra alongside astronomer greats like Galileo and Brahe. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

Even my appreciation for artists such as Celtic Frost, Slayer or Venom is just that - a part-time appreciation that I could really live without. What I even know about metal is just due to the friends I had growing up in Pittsburgh the general meathead culture of the music scene - I learned to appreciate things about it. But now, listening to 'Black Metal', it just sounds so fucking stupid. 'Lay down your soul to the gods of rock and roll', sure - I'll take the stupidity of druggy psych-outsiders instead. This is a nice remaster though on clear vinyl with bonus tracks which I also don't care about. [20 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I bought this a few years ago in Athens and then soon after the story came out where Phillips allegedly fucked his daughter and drugged her senseless with coke and heroin. Maybe it's because of that reason that I never even took the shrinkwrap off this, or maybe it's just because I forgot. Either way, I decided to ignore that potentially horribly story and give this a spin, the first time I've heard it in a few years, and I really really loved it. I've been really interested in this type of country music lately, where it's coming out of the 60s hangover and into a new expression of American myth. There's some great, great songs on here, like 'Drum' and 'Down the Beach', and it's really the group effort that makes it. The band is tight, there's some great piano playing on it, and the backing vocals are just right so it doesn't feel like the Mamas and Papas but really closer to the Flying Burrito Brothers. On 'Mississippi', Phillips sounds like <i>Loaded</i>-era Lou Reed, and it's an awesome tune. Closer 'Holland Tunnel' is a road trip epic, and also mentions Pittsburgh so I gotta give it up for that. Totally great, and I'm gonna spin this a lot and try to forget about the rapeyness. [4 March 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This pairing of Cherry and Appleton is incredibly exploratory experimental synth with Cherry's ethnomusical touches, as well as some voice. The two have a great sense of play, and even though Appleton's aesthetic is seemingly miles away from Cherry's earthbeat, they interact with each other to the point of total mind-meld. The sounds here are sparse, which really lets them breathe, and in some ways it suits Cherry's work around this time, particularly his Swedish period. It's not always clear what is electronic and what is a little whistle or other noisemaker, such is the recording. The only drag is that the hole is cut too small to fit over the turntable spindle, so I actually have to screw it in place, and then it's really hard to remove without almost breaking the record.

Side one's 'Animal Martyr' is low, and grinding; 'Yo Bobby' answers it by being midrange and drony, with occasional high-pitched squeals. The flipside, 'Thin Crisp', is an ode to a cracker, I guess. It's long and gets into navel gazing loops that are uneven and appropriately irritating, but without sharp edges. [7 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">A year ago I bought the reissues of these first two Dead C albums, but I haven't really listened to them.  They've gotten enough play off my old CD copies, though there's something pretty magical about hearing it on vinyl - especially with all that cassette hiss poking through.  This earliest Dead C stuff amazes me because of how fully-formed of a rock band they are.  There's a hell of a lot of dour atmosphere but this is an expressive, lyrical band working out of the same place that This Kind of Punishment came from.  When I listen to something like 'The Wheel' it's great how Russell is just fucking around and eveything is detuned, but it's not lazy or casual.  It wouldn't be much of an exaggeration to say that these records changed music forever, at least for a lot of important people.  A nice pressing and nice packaging is enough to make me happy, but I don't think i'll ever get rid of the CD since it's the sequence I'm more used to.

<p class="p1">'In Brooklyn After Dark' is a stomping rocker, a good choice for this to be a single (which I guess this is - a 12" single at 33RPM) with fun thrashing about and then a great thick organ ending. The b-side starts where the a-side left off - from the organ, and builds up some Charlemagne Palestine-like drones over which we hear some tape experimentation or other found sounds. It's very brief though, and I wonder why this wasn't a 7" or 10" or released at all, though it's great so I'm glad it was. [8 November 2012]</p>

I see now that Jon Lockie is the drummer, who I didn't know at the time I got this, but have since made his acquaintance. This is total NYC noise-rock, crouching fetally around a ungraspable bucket of scuzz. Howling vocals, distorted guitar shards, and Beefheartian drumming makes me think a bit of the Cro-Magnon LP, and weirdly, a bit of Savage Republic as well. The rhythms are here, sometimes overlapping, and there's a truly soaring, reach-for-the-stars energy despite the illogical construction of it all.The last track is the most diverse, with some really slow and grinding parts and a sparse desolate feel. Pretty good. [7 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The full length Religious Knives LP begins with the same fun stomper on the 12", 'In Brooklyn After Dark'. It's after this where things get really interesting - 'The Streets' featured creepy duet vocals over a looped rhythm and a lot of echo, recalling cult-psych touchstones while situating itself in a distinct atmosphere. This is well-recorded but not overproduced, hitting a perfect balance. The long songs are nice because they allow ideas to develop without being overly jammy. 'The Sun' brings in some electric piano and wind chimes, sounding mellow despite the stark vocal delivery. 'Noontimes' ends things on an hypnotic drone-jam, slowly plodding along with swirly organ and searing horn intrusions. This was already six years ago which is another crazy thing about time passing, cause it feels like yesterday. [6 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £15</p>
<p class="p1">I try not to buy CDs but this was impossible to pass up. The Shadow Ring were probably the "last" epiphany I've had with music - I suspect that now I'm too old and jaded (and it's too easy to hear everything immediately) for a similar feeling to come around. 1993-2003 is almost a perfect time period to commemorate because this was the last decade that something like the Shadow Ring could be possible, if that makes any sense. I don't know how else to articulate this without sounding stupid, but the Internet era, while bringing us access to vast amounts of riches, has also removed much of the mystery of isolation that drew me to such weird and outside sounds. I am putting my own personal background and feelings here, and I hope that kids today can still feel like they are discovering a secret world, but I have my doubts. Anyway, this band was a lifechanger for sure - and this is a perfect summation of what they did, carefully assembled in a way that combines some of their greatest 'hits' with obscurities, unreleased tracks, and live material. So you get 'Arthuring Tina' but then you also get a live jam on Pink Floyd's 'Interstellar Overdrive'. I'm glad they kept this straight - the sequencing is purely chronological, so disc 1 begins with the primitive clatter, mostly acoustic; disc 2 ends with total abstraction, the <i>Im Some Songs</i> level of dark conceptualism. In some ways you can say they developed as much as a band like Wire did, though i guess ten years is a long time. For a band so pivotal to me, I mostly know their work through mp3s I've downloaded (see?) so I don't actually have any of this stuff on physical media except a few tracks on disc 2. I brought this with me last year to the Estonian National Museum in Tartu when I actually ran a little seminar/talk about Graham Lambkin and the Shadow Ring; I think I played 'Wallet of Wasps' and then 'The Riverside' to a room of interested people, and thought how insane it was that I could be able to do that. The booklet is almost all photos, of the releases and of the band throughout their years - this is presented honestly, really managing to demystify a band whose music is so strange and amazing, yet who seem (from the photos) to just be regular beer-drinking blokes, albeit intensely creative ones from Folkestone. I'm so glad to have this, though it's already getting a bit beaten up, and I will still try to eventually track down all of the original vinyl releases. The lyrics to 'Put the Music in Its Coffin'  are printed inside but nothing else, suggesting this as some sort of thematic identity - it certainly is a poetic masterpiece. The live version of 'Hold Onto I.D' is from the gig at the Oakland Beehive on 16 September 1997, which my band with Weird Paul was asked to open up at - we had to decline because Paul had oral surgery that day. I didn't even go to the show because I was stupid, and I've been kicking myself ever since. Now I can at least hear what I missed. [23 August 2012]</p>

Most of <i>Big Cheap Motel</i> is live, a concert where they wrote a bunch of songs to protest the company who sponsored the concert because of sexist advertising. They are tackling gender issues here in an irreverent yet passionate way, and the musicianship is absolutely random. This is a snarling document for those who see the streak of genius in amateurism, and I'm certainly one of those. Despite the chaos, this is a band with a vision, and the pointed lyrics about desire, bodies and attitudes are inspiring in a weird way, even if there's something teenage about it all. Maybe I like this record so much because it's fun, first and foremost, and it's from New Zealand after all. [1 December 2012]</p>

This greatness is actually a distant, far-away sound due to the amateurish recording, amateurish performance, and total 60's sound. A few of these songs are just incredible to behold in all of their power and naievete - 'Tables of Grass Fields', and 'Answer to Yesterday', and of course 'Minister to a Mind Diseased'.

<p class="p1">My own time spent in Cincinnati with Spencer (and sometimes with Wiese) gives this place an almost mystical significance - certainly the place names these tracks are named after recall many memories of my mid-20s, which I get nostalgic for. But this should be about the music, which is excellent. These two have such a strong relationship that they are able to push each other into new territories; the physical volatility of Spencer's music is great against Wiese's careful precision. "Weekend Pass" might be the best example of this - it teeters on points, has lots of emptyness, and yet is still incredibly boundary-pushing.  A lot of electronics or what I suspect are electronically-processed voice tracks, so overall this feels somewhat clean; the more organic, room sounds ('Skyline', which I dream was recorded in a Skyline Chili but I'm sure it wasn't) contrast here and there to balance the disc as a whole. It all ends with 'Stettinius' which is as elegiac as appropriate given the subject matter. [25 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Spencer's side is more solo violin improvisation, where the recording and presentation is half of the magic. This moves (very quickly) between dictaphone muffle to possibly processed electroacoustic squalor. The violin playing is manic, arco and pizzicato at once. Sick Llama's side is more washed over drone/fuzz, with pulsing electric interference disguising what little motion there is. It's difficult abstraction, and when it gets more active it's still within very confined boundaries. [10 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">It's safe to say that this collaboration is a far different beast than anything Spencer has ever done before.  The musical segments are recognisable as his work, but the editing style tends to be dominated by Lieberman's channel-flipping glossolalia.  This is some amazing stuff though: a vibe that isn't really like anything I've experienced in waking life, except for all those moments in which I am awake.  Lieberman's taunting voice starts to develop a familiarity and though this is far more 'out' than most other music (most other music, full stop) it appeals to the part of me that appreciates the spoken work record as art form.  I think this is a record I will probably play hundreds of times, learning it's chasms and nuances.  And I'm really psyched that Spencer's branched out into this area because I think possibly his most interesting images are on thie record.</p>

<p class="p1">I don't know where Spencer found these guys - it's an Italian duo that makes moody, dense pop of which the Jesus and Mary Chain is the easiest comparison. Ringing fuzzy guitars, canned percussion, and reverb laden drone vocals, all making a fun yet druggy atmosphere. There's been a lot of bands mining this sound recently - this isn't that different than Merchandise except European and maybe a bit less noisy. But it's a great set of songs; unfortunately there's only a couple, as this is a 1-sided 12". According to discogs this is the only thing they ever released; I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if the whole thing is actually Spencer and someone else, but he's never told me.

<p class="p1">Lucas Crane, who I am definitely a fan of personally as well as musically, made this goofy horror-themed collage album with Ric Royer. This is modeled like an old radio show, with Royer's flamboyant voice attempting to deliver genuine spine-chills. Lucas's sound collages are great, though - when Royer shuts up and he takes centre stage, the album's most compelling moments happen. Unlike the Nonhorse stuff, this is spare and focused on supporting the narrative, which I unfortunately tune out quickly. Though I like the juxtaposition of narrative form with sound art/collage music, the genre-basis of this isn't enough to win me over. [8 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Two sides of solo Paul Flaherty saxophone is an intense listense for a Wednesday afternoon but the stark, cold squeals of the upper register are sort of appropriate for my mental state right now -  and also for looking out the window at a snow-covered Tallinn. The cover of this is similar wintry, and while there are moments of blues, they quickly spin themselves into sharper tendencies. These are live recordings with crowd noise throughout and it's a real gutbucket performance - some of the vibrato shakes the stylus out of the groove. Solo sax records are often a 'statement of purpose' for musicians and this is so truly the work of Flaherty, I could never mistake it for anyone else. [19 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A 2009 release by Jazzfinger captures the band doing what I've seen them do numerous times, so I think this is a good one to have, especially when I feel nostalgic. The final track, 'Tower of the Sunset Eye', rides out an acoustic guitar arpeggio and ecstatic, cheap keyboard swirls, all over the usual bowing, scraping and droning. 'Fishing Trip' struggles to stay interested with itself but creates that uniquely dissonant soup of sound which only Ben and Has can do well. The first side has some thick, pulsing drones, perfectly tense between a noise feel and a shoegazer ethos. The radiant pink-purple vinyl is one of the prettiest colours of vinyl I've seen, even though I rarely care about coloured vinyl; it suits Jazzfinger well, especially when combined with the drab beige-brown of the cover.

This is pretty thick with the synth and sax but I still tend to focus on his uniquely propulsive free style. Each side is a long jam, clearly cut from an epic session, and while this sounds very much like a one-off meeting, it's certainly successful enough. [24 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I dream of eventually tracking down Refrigerator's entire discography, though sadly some of their awesome recent albums are only available on CD (particularly my favorite, 1999's <i>Glitter Jazz</i>). This 7" from 1993 logically has a similar sound to their earlier stuff, particularly the <i>How You Continue Dreaming</i> album. There's scraggly guitars, no bass, and pounding drums, all recorded pretty lo-fi but with the angelic voice of Allen Callaci soaring over it. There's six songs on this 7" (though only five listed) and not a bad one among 'em. 'Black and White Photograph' has a darker, grungy feel and sounds like the kind of song I fell in love with in high school. 'Down by the Law' is a banjo-driven, gentle song that will go on every Refrigerator best-of mix tape I ever make in the future. At this time these guys had the perfect balance of melody, spirit, and messyness. A small dose like this might not be enough to convince a newcomer of Callaci's visionary abilities, but I'd hope anyone who was came of age in the 90s like myself will find something special here.</p>

And then on the b is 'Lola Langusta', a goofball sex number. It's brighter and also cleaner than I'm used to it, but every bit as infectious.

And there's a lovely bonus LP called <i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, clearly outtakes and less-polished songs, but still pretty solid - at least as good as their first LP was. Of course, I only play<i> Weird Era</i> occasionally. <i>MIcrocastle</i>, though, I'm practically wearing out. This is a masterful step forward for a great band, whose next album goes even farther, simultaneously pushing more inside and outside. There's a lot of pain in these songs, hiding behind the catchy hooks etc. I learned to love this album while listening on earphones at night, falling asleep to the first few songs over and over. Maybe because of this, I always associate <i>Microcastle</i> with sonnambulism in general - that hazy, half-conscious reality that is the 'real' hypnagogic pop. [27 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've never gotten as familiar with the News from Babel output as I have with Art Bears, which is a shame - it's essentially the same band from a songwriting perspective, but with Fred Frith replaced by Lindsay Cooper and Zeena Parkins. That is actually a big difference, as Frith and Cutler are like a mindmeld, but the different instrumentation is lovely and really makes Krause's voice feel more regal and operatic. This is a 45rpm 12" but fairly long, feeling as satisfying as a full-length album, and the higher speed mastering makes it sound great. The tendency towards grandiose chord changes, seen a bit in the Art Bears, is perhaps stronger here, but it works well even if I miss the more punk-edged aspects. I have the CD with their other album but I don't know it well; it would be nice to track down that one on vinyl but in the days of less disposable income, maybe not. [18 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">This split LP was released on Eno's Obscure label and it reads like a who's-who of the art-rock scene of the mid-70s.  Despite each side being attributed to one composer, it feels more like a compilation, as each track contains different musicians expressing different ideas.  Steele's pieces use larger groups and are musically conversational.  It's not dissonant, but it is austere and somewhat detached sounding.  A viola might make a sThe overall feel is like something that you would expect to come out of a forward-thinking musical academy in the mid-70's, though I don't mean this to sound derogatory.  Cage's side is much more minimal as most pieces are for just one solo performer.  Richard Bernhas seems to be the primary interpreter of the work, and the album closes with a beautiful solo piano piece never stops moving, yet is barely there.  Robert Wyatt sings on two tracks and Carla Bley on another - they are unaccompanied and the melody suits their voices well.  The Bley track feels a little bit like a medieval, new age-leaning songpoem though I'm sure if I concentrate on the lyrics they will be something hypermodern.  This is an interesting (maybe even great) record with a few really beautiful moments that fits well with Eno's aesthetic.</p>

<p class="p1">One thing that is so interesting about these SCG reissues is how fully-developed their sound was, even back in 1984 when they only had their first album out. <i>Fruit of the Womb</i> is a jammy instrumental cassette showing the wild jazz/psyche sound that they employ on many later albums. The cassette recording quality is perfect, as you can hear everything really well and there's a lot of great drumming by Gocher. 'When The Jewels Roll Out of Your Eyes' is a 25 minute long jam that sounds at times like Django Reinhardt mistakenly wandering into a punk club, and at other times like a Moroccan hash bar. The shorter tracks on side 1 are awesome too, containing some quotes that later ended up on <i>Torch of the Mystics</i> and other tunes.  <i>Polite Deception</i> is more of the same, pretty much. It's maybe a bit more rock and a bit less jazz, by which I mean a bit less improvised.  'Sun of Talisman' reminds me of the Black Sun Ensemble, a bit of guitar-god heroics. The set closes with 'Gulf Con '79', a departure from the rock in favour of a 17-minute experimental workout. There are gestural guitar acoustics, lots of static/field recordings, and a collectively improvised atmosphere - it's beautiful and strange, and somehow appropriate. [30 November 2012]</p>

When the electric guitar cuts in, it can sound quite nasty and biting, and those are point during which I really enjoy it. The anti-war song just sounds silly now, but there are some nice melodies; it's really the album closer 'Frustration' that is the pinnacle, particularly the fuzzy string section on the jam-out. The bonus disc has pretty much everything else they ever recorded - a novelty single ('Car Song') and then some live stuff.

This is a stomping heavy rock album with some really nice singing (there could be more, actually) and awesome, psychedelic guitar solos - a more tradition-based Comets on Fire, but somehow Major Stars don't really remind me of anybody else. The last song begins with a long, slow drone that eventually builds into some stunning rock riffage; the bass and guitar interplay is rock-solid.

<p class="p3">I used to have this on tape back in the ol' Summer of '97, that fateful summer where nostalgia rings most crushing.  Of course i was obsessed with <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love </i>by Built to Spill, so it was logical that I go back and check out earlier Doug Martsch work.  This is a crunchy pop-punk record but with an indie edge as opposed to the Fat Wreck Chords vibe.  You can hear a few screaming guitar solos though nothing like BtS wankathons, and there's a great cover of 'Andy Warhol' cause Martsch thinks Bowie's cool (though it's <i>Lodger</i>, not<i> Hunky Dory</i> that rules, so what gives?).  Now this is probably not the most essential record in my collection but the price was pretty good and I've been really swinging back to this kind of stuff lately.  I'm sure with repeated listens this could grow on me as much as <i>TNWWL</i>, though since I'm 29 and not 17 it's gonna be a lot harder to usurp it.  I will stand by stuff like this as "my" soul music, extending Soriano's analogy that Black Flag was soul music for white kids from the suburbs in the early 80s.  Maybe this is a sadly watered down essential musical experience but it's mine and it helped make me who I was.  I just realised that I've reviewed this as if it was <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i>, which I stupidly don't even own a copy of (did I lose it?  Lend it to someone? Sell it in some sort of indierock backlash?), something I will rectify now.  Oh yeah, Treepeople, well, they kinda sound like early Lemonheads a bit too.  [29 June 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">I was recently turned onto this record so I'm glad to stumble across a vinyl copy so quickly as I think it's kinda rare.  The cover here is pretty dinged up but the LP is in great shape and it sounds magnificent.  This record is pretty insane and probably worthy of "classic" status.  On the surface it's a drunken fiasco, loaded with fucked up covers of R&amp;B-influenced rock songs with tons of mistakes left in.  But, this is the type of statement that few artists ever make, and it definitely holds up one end of the continuum carried on by Pussy Galore, Harry Pussy, and other bands that don't have the name "pussy" in them.  There's still hints of the Big Star pop genius here, and also songs like "Alligator Blues" which do the R. Stevie/Ariel Pink thing (only better).  There's demented noise-rock guitar solos and stumbling, lurching rhythms, and it has bizarre production techniques as well - lots of distortion, uneen levels, etc.  This sounds remarkably fresh now given the plethora of bedroom pop "outsiders" like Gary War, Blank Dogs, etc. though this of course comes from a completely different place.  Chilton's genius is inexplicably tied up in his failure and this record might be his attempt to tackle it head-on, failing even though it's impossible to fail.  A masterpiece?  I suspect I will pull this one out more frequently than any Big Star records in the next few years though maybe I just listened to Big Star to death.</p>

<p class="p3">This is their second album together if my memory serves me correctly, and one that takes on a stronger American C&amp;W direction than the predecessor, <i>I Want To See the Bright Lights Tonight</i>.  Though the music is a bit jumpier and more fiddle-oriented, the lyrical content isn't any brighter.  These two were another step closer to the dissolution of their marriage and perhaps the songs reflect that.  "Never Again" at the end of side 1 is a really beautiful, haunting piece that risks drifting off into the atmosphere before it's even finished.  Because of the juxtaposition of dark melodies with brighter melodies, this may take a bit longer to connect with.  But there's a few of those driving Richard-sung tunes like 'I'll Regret it all in the Morning' which is like a series of continually raising M.C.Escher-like plateaus in a bleak nighttime landscape.  When Ben started getting into Richard Thompson he told me that he found it hard to believe RT could write songs like this without killing himself, because they were so depressing.  I think I'll agree with that, but what does it say that this darkness is what attracts me to his music?  I'll always maintain that these records, or Big Star <i>Sister Lovers</i> are far more depressing than anything like Joy Division because the pain is so genuine.  [29 June 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">I really love Dutch jazz and Leo Cuypers in particular, but I almost missed this LP because it was hiding in the 20th century composers section at this awesome Melbourne record store.  The first side is a trio of Cuyper, Arjen Gorter, and Martin van Duynhoven that rums through four rather rocking Cuypers compositions, presumably for the theatre.  All three musicians play as a rhythm section; despite flashes of showmanship from Cuypers and a great Arjen Gorter bass solo, this really feels like a tight power trio acting as one spirit.  There's a very rolling, swinging feel to these pieces that is very familiar from the Heavy Days are Here Again CD.  Side two picks up the same feel though adds Willem Breuker on a variety of reeds.  There's a small bit of synthesizer instead of piano, though it adds colour to the album and works well with Breuker's rich palette.  The slow descending lurch of 'Triste' is a highlight as van Duynhoven pulls back and lets Leo and Willem play around with each other's tonal centres.  Overall this is a record that feels lively and free, yet tightly focused on it's melodic agenda.</p>

The rustic, old-world pagan atmosphere saturates every second of this, whether it's violin-driven folk dances or bending, searing improvised moments. The female vocals are a good centrepiece to break up what would otherwise be a gloomy, dark trip. This is definitely a soundtrack that stands on its own, but I really should see the film finally.

<p class="p1">I only know the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band because they released their first album on ESP, which is surely the most odd fit for the ESP label. This is their second record, and it's such a goofy parody of ragtime/swing that it's strange I like it so much. It's hard to enjoy these rowdy Australians without thinking of that shitty pop-swing revival that occurred in the 90s -- which is apparently happening again as 'electro-swing' now (or at least that's what the local kids are telling me). As much of a genre pastiche as it is, the musicianship is good, the humour is solid (but not overbearing), and a few songs, such as 'Half a Moon' and 'Wait for Me, Juanita' actually tickle something soft inside me. I guess I like the Holy Modal Rounders too and as I get more into traditional Americana the best revivalists will float to the top, like cream. [6 December 2012]</p>

It's modal, Eastern-influenced as the title suggests, and has some strange tunings I think that give it a nice shine. I'm a big Lou Harrison fan and this doesn't disappoint, though it eschews his usual brightness in favor of a more shadowy sky, particularly on the third movement. It's got some beautiful gamelan-influenced moments, and that step-step-step progression that is so characteristic of Harrison's work is in full evidence here. [17 December 2012]</p>

This isn't really any different of a formula, just a bit less catchy. There are still a lot of good songs, and when they get slow and dirge-like it hints at a depth and potential. There's a bit more sentimentality here than the rough, punk-rock artwork indicates - it's a bit tied up in the artifice of these images, the subcultural attitudes of being young, etc. Perhaps it stirs some nostalgia in me, while of course twisting around the same influences I have. At this point <i>Sick to Death</i> sounds underrated to me so maybe I will listen to it a bit more frequently. [16 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">It was nice to find this Angst Hase Pfeffer Nase record in Denmark as I missed my chance to order it when it was still live in the distros. This begins with some strange vocals over noodling keyboards and unidentifiable (yet tinny) sounds - side 1 is very organic, with some reeds and cello, sounding like broken songs. It reminds me more of Fat Worm of Error (without the rock instrumentation) and of course Residents/Renaldo; the other record I have, <i>Seashard</i>, is far more shrill and busy. The second side is somewhat closer in terms of electronic resonance, but no less colourful. Sounds are constantly shifting, and Cooper's approach to layers and construction is as genius as Jan's recent Kemialliset material, though completely different, infused with his own personality. It's a great fit for Ultra Eczema and I'm probably moving Angst Hase to the "get everything he releases" category. [28 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is a pretty incredible record that I've never given enough time to in the past. It's the second Alternative TV record and takes the avant-leaning jamming from the first one and pushes it into a whole new arena. I always celebrate Wire for being able to push so far in 3 albums in their music and ideas, starting from the punk movement but being true artistic innovators. But Alternative TV maybe went further, faster. This has long, jammy free parts with intelligent, creative lyrics, but it's not even remotely like anything else happening in punk. It's far closer to Throbbing Gristle, mixed with some good ol' avant-gardisms - Robert Ashley, Kip Hanrahan, minimalist composition - all of these things are touched upon, yet put together as a coherent album. It's not an aggressive spit in the eye of the punk movement, because it doesn't care about that - they've already moved so far beyond by this point. [28 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Here's a nice thick repress of the first Harmonia album, on a Russian label. It sounds great - tinny in all the right places and deep and thick where it counts. The genius of this sound is that it's driving and abstract at the same time, able to be a focal point for psychedelic immersion as well as as background listening. Which probably explains why Eno was a good collaborator for these guys, as they had the same ideas about 'attention' and ways of listening. The more mellow bits with the guitar plucking are so beautiful, and not what I think of when I think of Harmonia, but really where the deepest bit of pleasure come from. [19 December 2012]</p>

'The Story So Far' is a bouncy art-rock number that recalls Art Bears through the baroque piano and clarinet sequences, and a Krause-like vocal part. There's a very dismantled cover of Joe Meek's 'Telstar' which is wonky and propulsive, and the whole thing ends with a bit of studio experimental called 'The Blues'. Great stuff, but I want more!

The tunes are midway between the almost-unlistenable <i>Land Speed Record</i> thrash-fest and the saccharine stuff that comes at the end; we end up with gems like 'First of the Last Calls', the amazing 'Diane', and 'Its Not Funny Anymore' which is one of the best Grant Hart songs for sure. Some Danish kid sold this, probably needing a fix - he wrote his name, MATTHIAZ, on the back of the sleeve, but with an anarchy sign replacing the first 'A'. Yeah. [19 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Dead at 24 are such an odd band.  I never really knew what to make of them back in '97 and '98 when I used to see them play all the time.  At times I found it annoying because it seemed like they were playing every show I wanted to go to, and their music was too fucked up for me to appreciate at age 17.  But thinking about them over the years, retrospectively, they've greatly increased in stature.  And I've come to love Alan's songwriting in Anita Fix and the Working Poor so much, that I was really excited to hear that Chris was reissuing the 'Blast Off, Motherfucker!' cassette.  Somehow he's made it sound amazing, apart from the live songs included which still sound great, just extremely lo-fi.  This is a good time to bring them back to the greater public, as this type of ramshackle art-punk is really fashionable right now. I remember this band as being really Steve Boyle-dominated - crazy synthesizer noise covering everything, making the songs only barely recognizeable.  But on the recording, the guitars are dominant and there are parts where Steve's contributions are sometimes barely noticeable.  Ernie's songwriting is a pretty different type than Alan's but it complements it well and gives the record a lot more depth -- as much as I love Alan's words, they are so dense and powerful that it's best to appreciate it in smaller doses.  I'm really psyched that Chris did this as I know it's been his dream for the past decade.  And of course it's nostalgia value is immense for me - I remember going to a party on New Years Eve 96/97 at the Rickety House with Brian where Dead at 24 played with the Korel Tunador-era Johnsons.  And meeting Alan that night and he gave me a 1985 sticker because I was really into them and we talked about bands and I felt like my life was about to change, just as soon as pesky high school could finish.  Well, it did.  So this is pretty crucial to it.  [11 July 2009]</p>

<p class="p1">Daniel and Sarah's collaboration is an unevenly recorded mixture of Sarah's homebuilt instruments and Daniel's broken-folk fuckery. The casual feel of these pieces is nice; when Daniel starts to sing, it's almost an afterthought, which is probably better with song titles like 'Unbagging the Wish-Spoon' (which is not to say I don't like his voice) -- it works. Throughout this is a sense of things about to collapse; farting horns, repeating arpeggios of plucked strings, sawing/bowed metal, and a percussive haphazardness. I'm really glad they decided to shape these into songs because it brings out a character in her work, even with Daniel's influence, that is really distinct. Normally, when people build crazy instruments, a lot of the resulting product becomes a show-and-tell, merely a demonstration of what they do rather than an exploration of their expressive tendencies. The way the recordings are sometimes from dictaphone or other lo-fi device accentuate them - I'm really glad this isn't anything close to a novelty record. I hope they do more together.

The final track, 'Plateau #1', uses a bunch of "Lee" objects to create a thick, bulbous sound that rides out the album nicely.

<p class="p3">Roope gave me this out of enthusiasm for Fricara Pacchu, who I must say is probably my pick of that whole Lal Lal Lal scene (I had heard a tape on Lieven Maartens' label a few years ago that I really liked).  This is relatively structured music with programmed rhythm tracks and strange dissonances bursting in at random times.  It's noisy and distorted at points, but not fuzzy - rather, it has a really fucked up Eastern feel, like a sci-fi take on gamelan music.  Despite the canned beats there are points where it breaks down and melts a bit.  I definitely dig this a lot - maybe this will turn around my attitude towards a lot of this scene, and I'm looking forward to seeing him live in October.</p>

<p class="p1">Finally, the answer to the question 'What could Evan Parker and John Wiese do together?'. I've heard the processed Parker before, with his own Electro-Acoustic Ensemble from the early 00s, but this isn't really processed at all. It's really live, actually; John's mastery of the digital world, laptop-MSP-etc, makes him an adept improviser, and the recording is top-notch, with Parker's flurries and impulses floating overtop John's more circular mechanics. Tommi Keränen mastered this and he made it sound intimate, which is nice for a record of this type. At 45 minutes it's a solid album and 'Dog Ceasearian', the 24 minute closing track, is a total circus, starting slow and getting into every imaginable interaction. Wiese chooses sounds that are metallic and edgy but fit well with saxophone - percussive in nature, and as usual he works the stereo field quite well so this is a good one for headphones (like all of his records).

<p class="p3">I'm glad VT had one copy of this left because this has become an 'all-time favorite' for the 7" format, though I have only known it through some MP3s I downloaded.  Vermillion Sands are an Italian pop-psych band that have the bouncy, catchy singing found in bands like Jennifer Gentle but with a slightly more garagey, less proggy sound.  That description may sound average but these three songs are so phenomenal that they transcend everything.  If these guys can keep it up with subsequent output then they will be a truly great band - retro, sure, but also full of youthful energy and a deep understanding of great music that comes through in the songwriting.  And if they don't follow this up with anything, then they've still released a truly classic 7".  [1 Oct 2009]</p>

<p class="p3">Another dull dawn, another Corsano solo album.  Not that he has that many.  This is along the same idea of <i>The Lonesome Cricketer</i> or whatever it was called, but sounding slightly more hi-fi (perhaps because everything sounds better on vinyl).  Over 15 tracks, Chris moves around from solo drums to little instruments, with a few surprising diversions.  "Kittenish Gnawing, part 2" is on a toy gamelan and it's played somewhat crudely, yet there's still a fantastic set of overtones.  There are some noisy scrapers, like part 1 of the aforementioned piece or 'The Frayed Elevator Cable", which sound like the more power electronics side of Burning Star Core.  When he's just playing drums, it's pretty great too - clattery energetic but with that distinctly narrative Chris Corsano style.  This actually is a bit of an odd release for Dennis to put out because it does adhere so much closer to traditional "improv" records, despite the unconventional instrumentation and the focus on short pieces.  Yet maybe he's onto something, for while this is a document of one of the world's most talented percussionists, I would never file this alongside solo Andrew Cyrile or Milford Graves records - this ain't jazz, it's just music.  [7 Feb 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">This record, made solo by one Justin Frye, is a song-based enterprise, a testament to late 00's bedroom-recorded psychedelia. Frye does a pretty good job of maintaining clarity in the songs - so the detuned electric guitars can go in their different directions and it doesn't interfere with the rhythmic swing. There aren't really any hooks here, and the songs tends to feel like improvisations - as a listener, I'm most impressed by the texture, construction and atmosphere, not any sort of lyrical basis. At some point I wonder if leaving some of the layers behind might benefit the record more - allowing the ideas to breathe, because there is something being expressed with words and melodies underneath, and instead of some artists who fuck up their songs like this, I'm not really pulled towards them. The artifice of a song can be dramatic, or mysterious, or contradictory, and all of those things are good - these deconstructions often lend a mystery, but instead of making <i>NYC Stone Age</i> feel like a treasure map, the mess on top of these songs just makes them feel like aborted experiments. Which is not in itself bad, but it doesn't really inspire me or even leave any effect on me. [22 August 2012]</p>

A few songs sound exactly like early Clean, and I can't complain about that. Now it's a few years later and I haven't played it in awhile, and the quirks and charms are slightly less inspiring, but I still think this is a pretty solid record. [28 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Two side-long explorations of the Idea Fire Compay's unique sound environments. 'Buzzbomb', despite it's title, is very low-key and has distended voices which eventually disappear into a cryptic, evil piano figure. It's distant, haunting, like the solo Mark Hollis piano track on the Allinson/Brown disc. The title track on side two begins with the most insanely wet, inviting sea of ambient tremolo Idea Fire Co.'s yet laid down. As the title might indicate, this is pure ear candy - an exploration of sonic beauty, a sleepwalk through the 20 minutes that it lasts. This is maybe not the most representational release for these guys, but maybe the most pleasant one to get lost in. [17 December 2012]</p>

There's no J.J. Cale song I've heard where I've been, like, 'Oh my god holy shit' or anything close to that. But the songs here are all solid, and feel a bit underwritten, or underexpressed maybe - everything is fairly casual, and it's hard to imagine what sort of vision Cale must have had going into the recording session.

The production is good and there's a balance here between thrashy hardcore and somewhat more, well, lyrical songs. 'Chickenshit Conformist' is probably the best tune but East Bay Ray's 'Do the Slag' is certainly the most fun. You can hear the DK's striving for a bit more musical variety here, though I would never call them unsophisticated, even going back to <i>Fresh Fruit</i>.

His flamboyant, wiry approach to percussion translates well into Neil's thoughtful bumps and Raymond's furtive squawks. It's unceasing in it's explorations - resisting the idea of 'gelling', with each member pushing apart from the others. Because of that, there's actually a lot of space but the patterns shift so fast it's hard to focus. When they're all scraping and grinding it becomes fairly mad, but mad is often wonderful and at the best parts it's exactly that - invigorating, alive. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A meeting of several Glasgow musicans and two Japanese ones, recorded just before I moved to Glasgow but not released until I left. Neil tends to get buried here a bit, and when the piano is playing along with Raymond it becomes pretty 'jazz'. The sparse parts, like 'Two Blocks East', feature the Neil Davidson I know and love. I think this was recorded at a live concert, cause when it gets quiet the space of the room actually overwhelms the tiny plucks and reverberations of the percussion and of Neil's guitar. Raymond has some nice licks and I like this best when they play gently but not so idiomatically. 'Euphoria', which closes the disc, is a really slow circular breathing workout that serves to diversify an already-diverse album. This goes into the pile of improvised music CDs, hundreds of which come out every year, that are all pretty good but easily ignored. It's sad to say that because these musicians really dedicate themselves to continual innovation and mastery of their craft, yet even fans of stuff like this, like myself, struggle to stay interested in it all.

<p class="p1">Neil started this CDr label last time I was in Glasgow and had a few lovely releases to begin, built around the idea of boats or something like that - I forget exactly. This release is really a Nick Fells outing, where Nick is on laptop and joined by Neil on track 1 and Una on track 2. The Neil/Nick cut is zany and bouncy, changing tack pretty frequently and with a big open-room space that allows the various what-the-fuck sounds to really reverberate. I'm not sure if Fells is processing Neil or if he's generating his own sounds - some of Neil's bizarre guitar sounds are clear, but in general I'm kept guessing. By the end it's a battle of chaotic feedback and static, though all still in a fairly "small" sounding way. When Una joins, it takes some time to get going, and the sound is all thick bowed bass, with the laptop echoing it and swirling it about. It's a soft, wet mess of low-end to rest in. It gets bumpier and ultimately builds into a wall of wooden sound. [25 July 2012]</p>

There's occasions when it's clear what is the cello and what is the double bass but not many; Neil's guitar sounds often like feedback as he's probably playing with the rotating stick I've seen him do so many times; elsewhere there is prepared moments, rumbling grabbing fighting, and general improvised interplay. I love strange strings and this is very much that - it's good all the way through as invigorating improvisations go. Nothing is too fierce but it isn't boring either, if you've come to listen.

But this is pretty decent too; anything with Bruford on it, really, is remarkable,and I particularly like when David Cross adds violin/viola, because it helps to fight that constant riffing/Don Cab feel that it takes on. John Wetton's singing I basically tune out and enjoy the music. Side two are longer pieces, instrumental thankfully, that verge between exploratory push-and-pull to lockstep melodic reinforcement.

<p class="p1">I never really listened to this split CD between VTB and LaSTPO, which is misleading titled as a collaboration. VTB have the first 5 tracks, and they're mostly instrumental - sparse, spacious scraping in a free-improv vein, really indistinguishable from a lot of the free-folk things happening at the time though culturally not part of that scene at all. 'The Open, The Closed, and the God-Like Shutter' is VTB at their most Third Ear Band-worshipping, but recorded in a way that really lets the mood ring out. The second half of the disc is the Frenchies, a band whom I sort of like in theory but then never actually want to listen to. There's a similarity to VTB in terms of rumbling, anarchic acoustic-based fuckery, but the vocals are exaggerated and French, with heavy breathing and grunting. The tunes are okay though, and I supposed this is a good, cohesive pairing; at least the production and sound approach by LaSTPO is better than the horrible computer-rendered artwork which adorns the CD gatefold here (thankfully they let Laurence's stuff appear on the outer covers).

I never saw the concerts but this was all underway while I was living with him so it's weird that I don't know this music at all. One of the vocalists is my good friend Giles and the other is Thom War, so this should feel like old friends gathering around. But it doesn't, at all. The compositions are slow, drawn out and open towards long vocal harmonies. This gives it a chamber-music like vibe, helped along by the bass clarinets and Peter's cello. When the vocals really take over in 'The Sun' it provides the most compelling moment of the project, attaining a sacred harp singers quality. The room really resonates here and there's an intensity without being too formal. Closing cut 'The Words' uses a lack thereof to create a dissonant ball of trepidation, leaving the whole thing to end in an unsettling manner. [25 December 2012]</p>

But <i>Low </i>is split between an album of classic, almost ridiculously good pop songs and an atmospheric, mostly instrumental second half. The mood is thus split, and one only feels properly 'low' at the end, especially after 'Subterraneans' which is wonderful. The songs on side 1 are deservedly winners, with Eno's fingerprints everywhere. It's a true vision of a new, cold, detached modern pop music that reeks of Britain's 70s and the towers of concrete and glass that now define our landscapes. [28 September 2012]</p>

I didn't realise that Koji was in this band until I actually ran into him at Colour Out of Space, where Kodama performed, and then it made a bit more sense. Anyway, there's a natural feel to the drone, but the calm is undercut by some malevolance under the surface; it's beautifully, precisely recorded and as full-fledged psychedelic listening experiences go, it's a cut above the rest.

Parts of this record mark a huge step away from the Vibracathedral drone and towards a more deconstructed electronica-influenced sound, particularly in track #2, 'Hydroponix' (the Kompakt label is a huge influence on Neil and you can hear it here in the repetitive electronica and glitchyness). As soon as I say that, some wonderful, loose organic plucking beigins 'Crex Fucking Crex', which is obviously Clyde-Evans or Tirath Singh Nirmala or whatever he's called. But a beauteous drone it is, and Neil brings in an electronic edge to create a mesmerising batch of sound. Side two follows the same format - opening glitchyness followed by extended jam, but this time, the longer jam completely succumbs to the digital pressure. It doesn't hold a candle to 'Crex Fucking Crex' but it's still an impressive workout from these Loiners. [15 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">An interesting pairing here. Side 1 is Alog, the Rune Grammafon artist who do a gently moving bit of electronic renaissance, with anthemic chants and the slow creep of computer-sound static. Under all of this, guitars swing back and forth like construction workers, until the weird vocals take over. Astral Social Club on the other side is definitely much more in the electronic realm as well, compared to some of the more John Clyde-Evans dominated work on the other releases. The three tracks here are very much in the German vibe that Neil digs so much. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Traded for the Boat Trip LP, when I get them. [2009] A meeting of Finnish underground personalities (Jan + Jani), this record sounds pretty much what you'd expect - like Uton on top of Tomutonttu. Maybe it's a bit more on the folky side, but then strange, broken toy synths will take over and destroy the vibe as soon as it starts to feel comfy. There's possibly some tension between their two approaches as this record never completely gels, but it doesn't attempt to widen the tension either, which leaves it feeling a bit unsatisfying to my ears.

<p class="p1">Experimental Japanese electronica is not usually my thing but I kinda like this record because it's built mostly from static, sounding at points like my stylus is going nuts. There's a regular rhythm throughout, the whole "clicks and cuts" thing, but it's infused with a nervousness that puts it on my wavelength. When other sounds come in - synth/organ for moments, it starts to take on the more clichéd sound of the genre for me, but luckily this is only for glimpses. A quick listen at 45rpm, and the grooves have beautiful visible patterns in them, just like all those Brinkmann 12"s I have. [25 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Lambkin's followup to <i>Salmon Run</i> is a much more placid, deep-listening collage. It's like a box of objects underwater, or more accurately like the scene in Tarkovsky's <i>Stalker</i> where the flowing water covers the rusty artefacts. Though evenly divided in terms of time, <i>SSCC</i> consists of many small, episodic pieces that form together into  whole. When my solo LP came out, one or two reviews compared it to this, and of course I was honored as Lambkin is a huge influence, though this actually came out after <i>Boat Trip</i> was finished. A sense of mystery covers everything, though the more alien sounds (the "Swill Radio" parts of the disc) pale when compared to the delicate strangeness of the every day, often accentuated by the tiniest details in the listening distance.

Roope continues the electricity on the B-side, with some shrill, squirting sounds, carnivalesque chords, and circular metallic resonance. It's dazzling, certain with intent and with a perfectionist tendency that I rarely see in the live sets. [17 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The Puke Eaters succeed with everything they try. 'Y.M.I. Dead?' puts a solid, ominous beat behind some rabid high-register clanging and a distant screaming voice. The sentiment is more goofy than morbid, almost like a mockery of dark, gothic music. 'Flesh Descending' is more akin to the Tomotonttu style of bending, warbly rhythms with overlapping thick layers. This is incredibly unsettling, constantly evading comprehension while still being based around repetition - one of the Puke Eaters' finest tracks yet. [10 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Another untitled Tomutonttu record, and this 10" is a pleasure.  Side one begins with some singing, but buried in the usual weird Jan-fidelity.  The tunes are melodic and rhythmic, but just off-kilter enough.  The everything-falling-apart fuckedupness that I've heard from him before (on his Ultra Eczema LP, and the few live sets I've seen) isn't present here, but there's still enough skittery movement to keep this from being too feelgood.  There's some great Indian/eastern timbres ringing through a few tracks (most notably the end of side 1) and a fairly dirgy march bit on side 2 that is strangely beautiful and moving, though not compromising the Tomotonttu sound one bit.  Overall this has a fairly more somber approach than other recordings I've heard, but it's still a ton of fun.  [4 July 2010]</p>

<p class="p3">Roope traded me this and I figured since I hang out with these guys all the time now, I should probably try to start liking their music.  This is two jammy sides that sound pretty much like they did live - like a ramshackle, noodly space-rock band.  The pieces are held together by Jukka's basslines which are repetitive and rhythmic, and occasionally they're actually catchy.  I'm still not really that wild about this, though.  At the beginning of side two, things become a bit more fluid - the electronic whirrs and whooshes take over for a bit, but the music keeps shuffling along.  There is something really "shuffly" about this, actually.  I wonder if Jukka is the presence that actually pulls them into a more accessible direction.  The first time i saw them live, before I knew anyone except Arttu, he wasn't there, and granted it was at Magneetti, but it was a million times more messy and fucked up than anything I've heard since.  I should try to get into this more, if only to prove the rule that it's hard to really dislike music when you are friends with the creators.  [16 Jan 2010]</p>

<p class="p3">The Puke Eaters (Erkki and Jan), here augmented by Chris Corsano, have turned in what may be the most rewarding single album from the whole recent Finnish underground (at least from what I've heard).  Viewed as a sum of its parts, you can hear how the Reijo Pami and Tomotonttu sounds combine, and if Corsano is the one on the more percussive bits, then he's successfully unlearned everything he knows. The tracks are fairly short, just two to three minutes of sound exploration, but there's a focused vision to each track rather than a jammy, exploratory mess.  I particularly like the juxtaposition of (very nicely recorded) acoustic textures with nervous, semi-inept clattering.  The sense of movement is great here, and whenever there's delay/reverb effects used, it's natural and you barely notice them (or at least you don't think "That's a delay pedal").  Brilliantly strange stuff, but the personnel is top-notch.  [6 July 2010]</p>

It resembles a 'drum solo' too often but Carlos isn't content with that, so you can hear him working in all sorts of subtle electronic effects to gradually alter the mood. But this too, is over in a blink of an eye - this is really an EP if anything. [29 November 2012]</p>

Niko-Matti is still the principle songwriter but it's anchored by an organic core, which is lovely when Jari, Jukka and Jaakko take the jams into a more Krautrock style (which is only present a bit here at the end of side 1, compared to the live show which was much jammier). Pekko Käppi's kantele really sets a dark, folky base, and there are a lot of guests from the scene; Topias, Antti Tolvi, and Lau Nau (who lays down some beautiful vocals at the beginning of side 2).

This is Alasdair's debut release, from the late 80's, a massive 4LP collection of songs, fragments and experiments. Compared to the B12 that I know and love, it's wildly different and very straight. There's still a very singular vision at play but some tracks fall into genre experiments much more. Certain tracks (all are untitled) remind me of 90s post-rock like Fridge, and others sound like Bügsküll. But it gets weirder as it goes along; at the end of the second record it starts to get into bizarre cutup logic, which is more like the B12 I know. This is so massive to listen to - but surprisingly diverse, so spending two and a half hours doesn't get tiresome. It's probably mostly solo Alasdair, but who really knows? There's some female vocals in a few places and the song structures are pretty solid. In many ways this might be seen as a transition between what he was interested in and what he solidified his focus towards, though 'solidified' is entirely the wrong word to use when talking about something as exploratory as the B12. I'm not sure how I managed to spend so much on something but it's a true jewel and probably will never be reissued, so thank god for eBay. [24 December 2012]</p>

Different movements come and go throughout the tinkling and it's quite remarkable as a whole - a really great, great record. It's mostly dissonant, but the overtones eventually ascend into a haze that is inviting. The A-side stretches forever and then the B-side changes tone, but only a little bit.

If you like big guitar solos, big organ solos, and big drum solos, it's all here. The record is aptly named - it's simultaneously passionate and evil, full of raging desire and nihilistic  vitriol at the same moment. The tracks are long and jammy, and they stretch out through various studio effects (even the drums sound processed), reminding me of a logarithmic take on the first Tony Williams' Lifetime album. Which is fair enough, as organist Larry Young played on that record, and also on <i>Bitches Brew</i>, but this takes everything to a further level of 'out'. The opening cut, 'Peace', really does feel like an introduction, as it's fluid and expansive, taking it's time and introducing the musicians in a non-corny way. Other cuts, like side 3, are crunchy and aggressive; repetition is used to keep the musicians playing at each other, pushing along a groove through almost subterranean tactics. There's more ring-modulated guitar here than an early 00's Dead C album, and despite all the chaos, there's a lot here to reward patience. [28 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Exhilarating, aggressive and burning with a fierce edge like almost nothing else I can compare it to -- Orcutt's first solo album revisits the mad freedom of his Harry Pussy buzzsaw but through an amped up acoustic guitar. Before I heard this, I saw him play live with Paul Hessian in Brighton and it was an amazing interplay of free guitar that kept it's freedom within very strict boundaries. On his own, it's even better - the spaces and silences between his handchops give it a structure and momentum that no doubt came from a dedicated vision that took many years to unfold. Orcutt's put out a few more since but nothing has quite had the impact, the out-of-nowhere mindfuck, the gravitas, as this. As gritty as this is, it's a surprisingly everyday guitar masterpiece - it always seems to fit my mood. [15 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Easy psychedelia is still a nice world to inhabit and I've always liked Ducktails and Matt personally. This record is so pleasant it's impossible to say anything bad about it except maybe to criticise it for taking the easy road. But this is the style he works in - light breezes, gentle strums, straight-forward rhythms, yet something still a bit strange about it all. The guy has a vision, and it's a well-constructed one, and I've listened to this quite frequently over the last few years when looking for something relaxing but not completely minimal. Bugskull is a good comparison, though I don't know if he's ever listened to Bugskull. [29 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Mohel is one of the finest in Finnish free jazz, and their three-sax attack is as brutal on record as it is live. Taneli is on tenor here, because Janne Martinkauppi is on bariton, and the two drummers (Jaakko and Petri) are ferocious as well. But despite the full-steam-ahead aesthetic, this doesn't sound anything like old ESP releases or whatnot. Side 1, the lovely doubly-negatively titled 'There Will Never Be No Peace', has some bursts of human air through brass that are so aggressive they almost tear the speakers out - the rage and frustration of the title carries through. How I miss these live shows; seeing aggressive free jazz in Estonia is such a rarity that I should probably think about traveling over to Helsinki more for it. [29 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Boris Morgana were the first friends I made in Helsinki, so it's odd that I don't really have any of their recordings. This tape finds them trying different things, rooted around a rock around. Side B begins with a shrieking, crazy vocal track over some solid riffage. The more Kraut/art-rock tendencies take some time to emerge here, but they are also covered in some vocal madness - harmonies of pure pain, a bunch of Finns emoting together something dark and strange. The 70's vibe is dominant, especially when Hermanni and Taneli add the violin and sax to the mix. If my primitive Finnish isn't too rusty I think this title means "Hall of some others" which is appropriate for the sense of distance and unbelonging conveyed. [30 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Eat Skull's followup to the fantastic <i>Wild and Inside</i> is a fairly plodding hard-rock song with heavy bass thumping and ecstatic electric guitar solos.  The lo-fi sound is scorching but it's over in a minute 45 or so, and I've learned nothing.  Side B is where the brilliant buried pop hooks emerge -- 'Dont Leave Me on the Speaker - Thank you!' has a great 60's retro strum vibe and just a perfectly calculated level of fuzz.  It's catchy with some Phil Spector guitar hooks and an example of what I love about Eat Skull.  'Smokebreaks' is a faster, manic jam with some confused bashing about.  [5 April 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">Jailbreak was Heather and Corsano, and it's a lot more punk/aggro than I expected, cause Heather's blasting her pedal steel through some wicked distortion. She keeps a consistently nasty tone throughout, and when she solos (as on side two) it's a really mesmerising and evil sound. Corsano keeps it turned up to 11 pretty much throughout the whole record, and it's recorded in a properly lo-fi way to actually sound like a raging hellbeast. There's vocals too, from Heather, but she sounds like an angry punk dude instead of herself which is kinda awesome too. Corsano's prowess need not be remarked upon here, except to say this is as good as one should expect. While I guess this was just a one-off project, its pretty great and one of my favourite things Heather has played on. [14 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Richard's LP was billed as 'ecstatic house' which is what I thought Heatsick/Steve Warwick did. This is definitely pulsing electronica generated entirely with keyboards, but it lacks the repetition and (in my opinion) annoying nature of house music. Instead you find Richard's same fascination with layers of psychedelic drone - this is not a million miles from the amazing Youngsbower CD, though without any guitars. As usual, the sounds are warm and sweeping, building up ideas in longer bursts (there's six tracks here) and establishing a consistent mood that, while it bears little resemblance to his vocal and guitar work, definitely comes from the same musical consciousness.

The songs are pretty much about getting wasted, almost dazzlingly unpoetic, and accented by Shinki's powerful guitar chops. Classics include 'Stoned out of my Mind' and 'Ode to the Bad People'. I should look for the second album which is apparently a studio assemblage and not really a power trio at all. [18 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">This is my favorite Refrigerator album but one I never owned, getting intimate with it via MP3s only.  I grabbed this off eBay because I was just in one of those moods, even though I hate buying CDs -- this, sadly, was never issued on vinyl.  I really think this is the high water mark for this band, whom I love so much, though it's definitely far more polished than their earlier wonderful stuff.  It opens with 'Tourists', which, while confident, contains the same white-soul negative space that I love about their earlier records.  Franklin Bruno's meandering piano line is perfect and I didn't realise til I looked at the booklet that Ira and Georgia from Yo La Tengo do background vocals.  Anyway, the album is so incredible and there are a few highlights that bring me almost to tears.  'Western Disconnection' is maybe my favorite Refrigerator song ever -- the winding bassline and the soaring vocals just perfectly capture the essence of some magical moment that I never can make myself feel anymore.  And then 'Heart of Bone', a poem sung over a simple looped structure that is an absolute masterpiece - one that gives me a spooky, shuddering feeling everytime I hear it.  'Sweet A.M.' is a brilliant finish too, Refrigerator's 'Our Singer'.  I didn't <i>need</i> to buy this, but as CDs go, it's actually a really beautiful printing job and it's nice to have the lyrics typed out. I'll never deny my love for 90s indie stuff and this one will hold up forever. [11 April 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">'In The Wood' retains the rolling, fun shuffle that Vermillion Sands do so well, lyrically rejecting someone else being proud of the vocalist, because she doesn't need it. Nice organ playing too. The flip has 'May', a fair aggressive rocker, and a cover of the American traditional 'Trouble in My Way' - great to hear a slice of Americana delivered by a weird sounding Italian girl. All three songs have a slight edge to them and it's another winning side from this band. [7 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The Dirty Projectors really took me by surprise with this record, which connected with me in a way that their previous work never did. What's paradoxical about my enjoyment of this band is that the most distinct characteristics of the Dirty Projectors - the oddball deconstruction of the song structure, the broken-sounding experimental approach to pop  - are not what I like about them. It's when the band is straight-forward and direct that I connect, and feel some real power in their songs. But it's not that clearcut of an explanation, because there are aspects of the experimentalism I love - the guitar-god jamming is uniquely strange, brilliantly exploratory, and passionate. But if it was all just that, I would only enjoy it to a certain level. So it's really the direct songs juxtaposed with strange angles that I find so moving. This is mostly great all the way through, but 'Two Doves' is the one tune from this album that completely cripples me It's a song that really hit me personally at the time I most dived into this album (2010), and it's magical and punishing to my ears.  I've come to love the followup even a bit more, again for the largely straight folk/pop songs surrounded by all the contemporary detachment. This gap - this space between honesty and the slightly show-offy aspect of the obtuse structures - is maybe what I've always wanted to explore myself with song-based music (and have consistently failed to do so).

<p class="p1">On the surface, the Electric Bunnies appear to be another upstart bedroom punk band, a product of the Terminal Boredom generation, appropriately situated on Florida's Dying and releasing sloppy, lazily-written songs. But I think <i>Through the Magical Door</i> is a real cut above the rest, as the songs are solid, the playing appropriately psychedelic (without compromising the fun, punk attitude), and some bits being genuinely out-there. There's jams like 'Psychic Lemonade' which are pure 60s pop perfection, but also some more Velvet Underground-styled dirges. It's actually really impressive to me how diverse of a sound they have, plus the packaging, which is all die-cut board game-style fun (I declined to cut up my sleeve though) is brilliant. Let's hear some more from them. [3 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">I came around really slowly to Deerhunter -- when I first downloaded this back in '07 I thought it was interesting but never really gave it much consideration.  Then I somehow got super into <i>Microcastle</i>, in a way that I didn't really enjoy indierock anymore.  So I went back and grabbed this to have the nice vinyl collection, and plus it has the <i>Flouresecent Grey</i> EP which is a minor masterpiece -- the song in particular, is so haunting and chilling that I think it's definitely one of the gems of the past few years.  And it's made all the more intense by being about death, and then Jay Reatard covered it, and then he died;; anyway, <i>Cryptograms</i> has some pretty fantastic parts.  The more upbeat tunes, particularly when driven by the noodly basslines (such as 'Cryptograms' or 'Octet') are super intense, and the thick vinyl pressing sounds fantastic.  But then the more sketchy tunes like 'Providence' are quite brilliant as well.  I think Bradford Cox might really emerge as an important 'voice', though on <i>Cryptograms</i> he is hiding his songwriting a bit behind all of the textures.  But what I loved about <i>Microcastle</i> was how thick it was with subtleties.  The more I listened to it, the more I heard, and the more utterly miserable and depressing the record proved to be.  <i>Cryptograms</i> has a lot to invest in too, though I don't know if I will find the lyrical content quite as affecting.  That's okay though, cause this is a great album too and hopefully this band will keep providing.

<p class="p3">This is a pretty early candidate for album-of-the-year, or at least album I've listened to the most.  In fact, this is probably the most I've listened to any record in years.  I downloaded this about a month ago and listened to it maybe 20 times before realising it was a Glenn Donaldson project.  That makes sense now, but it even surpasses the Famous Boating Party in greatness for me.  Sure, it's a bit silly and contrived, trying to ape the Style Council and maybe it's a bit disingenuous -- but if you wanna talk about a band that tweaks all of my art-pop switches, this is it.  Glenn is a sweet dude and I know he's just passionate about this stuff, and the songwriting is great great great and the production is a perfect copy of a style. The bass playing really makes it, but also the way cheap fuzz/delay effects will kick it on the guitars (or even vocals), plus the songwriting is just great.  I like Skygreen Leopards but there's something much more concise at play here, and plus I like this style more than the post-Dylan hippie thing.  I wish this was longer but maybe it wouldn't be so perfect.  I have probably listened to this over 40 times now.  My favourite song keeps changing (currently it's 'Sculpture Gardens') which is a sign of a classic album, or maybe one I will burn out on soon.  But I'm enjoying it while I have it.

Moron Quest side 1 is some discordant breathing into what was once presumably a trumpet. It's close-mic'd, distorted, and with an ominous hum in the background, but that's part of the charm. The rattling bit in the middle is especially beautiful, and there's some good throat clearing at the end. On the b-side it's more clattery and accidental, yet no more coherent.

<p class="p3">Pascal and Kelly really kick some ass on their first LP.  It's a new way to approach free music, and it's strikingly it's own sound despite having roots in fluid, organic jazz and spacey jam music.  Instead of going for the balls-out freejazz drum freakout, Pascal is very languid, exploring the space and providing a good sparring partner for her flute.  There are some mellow passages where she uses tapes or electronics or something, and when the flute cuts back in (at the end of side one) it's positively epic, yet also sounding like it was recorded some time in the 1950's.  Side two is a long live recording from Den Haag and it's a really unique exploration.   It's thick in the low-mids and the flute sounds so diverse as it billows out of the speakers.  I'm obviously a bit biased because these are friends of mine, but I think they turned in a really really solid record here.

<p class="p3">This LP is a live recording of an octet collaboration between Part Wild Horses Mane on Both Sides, the Hunter Gracchus, and Chora.  It's nice to hear a documents of the Sheffield/Manchester young free axis, which I only partially crossed paths with in my UK music days.  Despite the large lineup, all of the players provide a lot of space and because the flute and drums are so predominant, it feels quite led by Part Wild Horses.  The billowing, organic noodles of Chora (at least from the time I saw them live, as I'm still not familiar at all with their recorded work) decorate everything, and Hunter Gracchus (which I guess is John and Fiona from Sheffield) are probably the ones providing the wordless chants and vocals on side B.  This is a live recording from a performance in Lyon and it sounds like a soundboard recording - there are parts where it feels a bit compressed, and the droning bits are a bit unclear as to what they actually are (probably guitars?).  Everything tends to plateau into a cloud that is not droney or minimal, yet somewhat horizontal anyway.  There's tons of movement, don't get me wrong, but it all feels a bit constrained.  You can hear kazoos and other noisemakers jutting out into their own areas but it's all propelled along by a rhythmic casual stroll.  I should have checked these guys out more when I was around because I think they're all interesting players that are negotiating a good balance between free, jazz, and noise.  If there's one main criticism is that they by not fully committing to any of those three camps, they end up filling a rather indistinct netherregion.  [4 July 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">This is one of the most elaborate and beautiful CD packaging concepts ever, and I'm grateful to Mark for this gift. This is Mark + Barry in 2007, for a radio broadcast which is why this is just about a clean hour. It's not as narrative as the radio experiments they would later do, but instead a collection of 21 short tracks that showcase their bizarre take on sound manipulation. Though these guys are often humorous, this isn't so ha-ha funny, even if the track of Barry arguing with someone about cigarettes veers into this territory. Instead we get a playful investigation of what sound processing can achieve, through effects, repetition, or juxtaposition. Things are very clean, as always, and while there's no doubt they used computers to piece this together, it doesn't feel overworked. As I always feel when I listen to Vernon &amp; Burns, I miss working with these guys.  [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">How I love Mark and Barry, and especially the pleasure of having them on vinyl. This is classic Vernon and Burns - carefully assembled soundworks that are mostly built around field recordings and an affable accompaniment, occasionally with singing. Their vaudeville influence comes across on the record, where you don't see them perform, as more "old-timey" than straight vaudeville. Songs like 'The Night We Invented Forgetting' are incredibly beautiful and chilling; this record overall has a more reflective atmosphere, leaving some of the humour behind. I think listening to this, <i>Lost Lake </i>makes a lot more sense, actually, or is at least more clearly a 50/50 collaboration. The liner notes are awesome too because there are descriptions of each song on the back cover as well as on the sleeve, so you get two viewpoints. [2 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I have a soft spot for Hotlegs, the pre-10cc band featuring most of the core band. There's some really sophisticated pop songs here, laced with the same irony found in 10cc's stuff, and some excellen tearly 70's British pop production as well. 'Today' is a sweeping ballad, as good as the Beatles could manage; 'How Many Times' is a superb song that is beautiful and catchy. The breeze blows by on 'All God's Children'; 'Run Baby Run' takes on something countrified, done quite well for these Mancunians. 'Neanderthal Man' is the novelty song which I like better than either of the Kinks tunes ('Apeman'/'King Kong'), precisely because it's so under-formed. I still need to brave the Godley and Creme triple LP concept album but I've just never stumbled across a copy. [27 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Honky Tonkin'</i> is not one of my favourite Mekons albums but maybe I never gave it a fair chance. This 12" single of 'Hole in the Ground' also featured the same album's 'Prince of Darkness', with Michelle Shocked on vocals, so the only new song is the cover of Flying Burrito Bros' 'Sin City', which is great and worth the record. But 'Hole in the Ground' is a pretty great song, actually - as great of an indictment of Thatcherism and the loss of a manufacturing jobs in the North as anything I've ever heard. It's really beautiful and sad, though still a driving Brit-country tune. [22 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Both songs on this 12" are exactly 6:00 long, which is nice symmetry. 'Bob Hope Takes Risks' blasts through in what feels like quicker time, though in the course of those six minutes we're taken through collapsing Cecil Taylorisms, echo-drenched spacetravel strings, a lumbering, punchy horn section, and Neneh Cherry's brilliant vocal glossolalia, singing about getting stuff in your eyes. 'Hey Mr. E! A Gran Grin With A Shake Of Smile' is a total B-side, more of a sketch, with a dub feeling. A great find for £3! [7 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Early Paul Bley, leading a band,is rambunctious and horn driven compared to those miserable downer ECM piano records I listen to so often. Carla actually wrote most of the tracks except for the collectively improvised title track at the end. Marshall Allen is the alto here and he squawks along with trumpeter Dewey Johnson so much that the whole thing is bumpy, but in a good way. The cacophony peaks probably on 'Ictus', but it rips itself apart as soon as it builds, with a great Eddie Gomez bass solo. The more fluid sections are mere diversions from the jerkyness, which is probably due to Milford Graves's style, which is quite heavy on the toms. Or maybe it's just the way this is recorded - a classic NYC mid-60's loft sound. You can practically feel the dust on the wooden floor and the smog from outside traffic. [26 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Here's Braxton in a quartet with three competent European dudes, recorded in 1976 in what was probably a lark. "Tradition" is a word that started popping up on jazz records in the late 70s and it signaled a return to that - and a migration from the adventurous explorations of the late 60s and early 70s. This is exactly that  - an LP of Charlie Parker, Johnny Green, Richard Rogers and Miles Davis tunes, delivered in a straight-forward manner. While I'm not usually that wild about hearing these standards, when juxtaposed with the other 9 Braxton LPs I own, this is actually kinda fun, a nice break. He plays contrabass clarinet on the first track, and the tone on that instrument is wild - at first I thought he was processing his alto through an octave pedal, or playing with a weird mute. Overall this is a stab at commercial success, but the man certainly did not abandon his vision, just had some fun with standards here, so I can have fun listening to it. [9 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I'm not so into this; I have a soft spot for Mantler because he's done some great work, but this solo album from the early 80s is just too much of the bland electric fusion style to really intrigue me. Carla Bley, Nick Mason, and Steve Swallow play on it but they aren't doing a whole lot to sell me. The washes of rack-effect electric guitar are at least slow and mellow, as opposed to some jazzbo fingertapping wank, but this might be too dull for even my tastes. [3 March 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I got my ears cleaned out today and everything I hear has more detail - the best I've heard in years. I've been taking it slow with music but I put this on, kind of randomly, and found myself amazed at how enjoyable it is to just lose yourself in music. This is mostly Frith and Ostertag, on synth and guitar but mostly (at least it seems) using tape. I wouldn't call this a straight-up tape collage because it's clearly improvised and live, and Minton wails on side 2, and there are actual instruments though in the hands of these guys, you can't really tell. Most of this record sounds like a few radios fighting each other, a description I once heard of Arab on Radar's later lineup, which is a complete compliment in both cases. When there are more obviously guitar sounds - plinks and plonks - they serve to ground the overall mix. The source material contains lots of foreign-language radio broadcasts, lending (along with the album's title) a very political feel. [9 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Luke released this really interesting CD which is a Bohman Brothers side project, a very strange collaboration that touches on a lot of territories of improvised and processed music. Knowing Luke as I do, I totally see why he loves this. There's a lot of the Bohman's tape-manipulated sound constructions and a lot of acoustic samples, really making this the same genre territory as the Lied Music/Vernon &amp; Burns material. But there's also two guys involved in this who used to collaborate with Die Trip Computer Die, and you can hear this tendency towards broken song structures and more rhytmic repetitions, especially on 'Foot Right Down'. It's an impressive record and it shifts gears really after the four act suite which opens it, which features disembodied operatic samples to make something worthy of the name Romantico.

<p class="p1">Moon Unit started as a side project of Pyramidion and got a lot more popular locally, as they ride a feelgood wave of thick Krautrock-style jams. This is heavy, deep psychedelic rock, with swirling keyboards and thick, layered guitars, but it's never abrasive or noisy. Side A starts slow, with the drums creeping in, before attaining a back and forth momentum over a razor-wire guitar line. The keys are layered but constantly swirling around each other, like perfect ear candy. The B-side picks up where this left off, rocking out til the end, an easy horizontal structure that blends minimalist construction with smoky, eye-widening awe. The ending guitar part is meaty, cutting through like a knife, until there's only an echo left in the room. I don't know if they are still active or playing under this band - maybe I should send Rory and Andreas an email to catch up. [23 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Raymond and Peter are brilliant here, a session recorded at the Streetlevel space in Glasgow that I went to a few times. Peter gets a wobbly cello improvisation going and Raymond wobbles right over it, which sounds like a continually unstable, organic sound creature. There are some mesmerising bits, so active it's hard to believe it's only two people, where the soprano sax soars over Peter's thick, active movement. The voices are good too, not as song-based as Peter's later solo work, but not abstract either, actually using them to support the improvisations as fragments of language. The atmosphere is great too - Streetlevel is an excellent room for improvised acoustic music. [20 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £9.89</p>
<p class="p1">Before I left Pittsburgh I copied a bunch of mp3s from Andy, onto the off-brand iRiver MP3 player I had, which served me damn well over the years. This was one of them - a new Drag City artist, something that appealed to the more quirky side of my folk tastes, I guess. Connections to Deerhoof through a one-off project called Nervous Cop ... Drag City is my favourite label ever, probably ... can't really go wrong here! I don't remember precisely the first time I listened to it, but by the time I arrived in Japan I was listening to it multiple times per day. This was 8 years ago - April 2004 - and I have a distinct, yet abstract memory (as it must have happened multiple times) of waking up where I was staying, looking out over the green tea fields, and listening to Newsom's odd songs as the morning dew lifted. By the time I got to India, this had become so much more than just an album to me - it was the personal soundtrack that happens so often in summertime life, but in this case it was the most turbulent and (at the time) exciting summer of my life, so -- bonus points! (I remember listening to Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i> lots too that summer, which can only accurately be described as a breakthrough album for them, but it didn't have the same personal impact as this). That summer culminated in a drunken folk-based music festival in Wales where Newsom performed, a seemingly appropriate denouement to the Summer of Newsom, the Summer of Emotional Upheaval, the Summer of New Friends and New Places, the Summer of a Window to a New Life. I was pretty drunk and didn't really enjoy her set - I don't even think I watched it all - as the live performance failed to impact me in the same way the record had. Or that was my excuse. Because the reality is that I felt like I was compromising my secret relationship to <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i>, sharing it with hundreds of British music fans.  In retrospect, that maybe was the last time I felt the sense of elitism/belonging through a common shared experience degrade.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On the inevitable flight back to America in early September, I picked up the Guardian at Prestwick airport and found an article by Dave Eggers about his relationship to <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i> and how he hoped she looked like the crazy toothless had that she sounded like. But of course, she is kind of beautiful and odd like her music, and for some stupid male reason that is disappointing. The story plays out as we all know - Newsom makes an overambitious second album (which some people love but I absolutely can't stand) followed by an overblown third album (which I like parts of but find a chore to get through) and generally her star fades, as it always does under the bright lights of fame and attention. She's now well-known enough that I'm just one of a zillion other kids who love this album, and she's probably gone as far as one can in the music industry these days - I wouldn't be surprised if she never releases another note. And I even hung out with her once randomly in Helsinki and she was really nice and I didn't bother to tell her how much her first album meant to me when I was 24. I'm not anymore and this means something different now. Which is fine with me; I'll always be grateful for that summer and those memories. </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Writing about the actual music here seems irrelevant, but spinning it now it hasn't lost any of it's charm after all these years and so many listens. The epic, punishing masterpiece is of course 'Sadie', which I spent great amounts of time in 2004 and 2005 discussing with Spencer or anyone else willing to talk about it - but listening to 'Cassiopeia' or 'Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie' is no less powerful, especially today. When you love something so much you can sink deeply into it to the point that you pass completely through it, and that's probably where I'm at now. I can feel the power, but I'm happy to let it pass by and just spin this for nostalgia's sake. [26 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Ben from the Country Teasers is so prolific that he releases a bunch of Rebel stuff all the time on the side. There's not a major difference between the two sounds - both bands are led by his off-key, snarky wail, and I suppose the Teasers are nominally a 'country' band while The Rebel is much closer to punk-rock. But nothing is fast or furious - it's midtempo British snarls throughout. Lyrically there's probably a lot less irony - songs with fairly improvised lyrics that get into political issues I know he actually stands behind, such as gay rights. "It's cold outside but your vagina is warm" is the type of lyric that only this man can write, and while of course I think of the Fall a bit while listening, he's infused a personality of his own into the music.

This is inventive as hell, a band that mixes incredible technical prowess (off-kilter time signatures, discordant tonal progressions, bizarre arrangements) with something quite communicative and lively. The handclapping bit on the second side is absolutely fantastic, clearly recorded as a live improvisation, but seamlessly integrated to the piece as a whole. I played a party at Pete Spynda's flat with these guys years ago and was left really cold by what I saw, which seemed to be an overly brainy, distant bit of wankery. But on record, I think there's an obvious nod to the traditions of smart progressive rock, without being a victim of the past. I should really investigate the rest of their discography, but I probably never will. [22 August 2012]</p>

Out of that whole brief scene that revolved around Woodsist a few years ago, this might be the one record that stands out the most, though really just because it's a good amalgamation of styles. The band switches frequently between clean n' jangly argpeggios and teenage fuzzpedal stomping, with the drumming crashing about wildly with cymbals. The singer moans out of the side of his mouth and the songwriting leaves no impression on me about meaning, intent, etc except that it's quite a good sound they've constructed. Reminds me a bit of Eat Skull, who are also from Portland, but possibly a more fun, poppy version. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

This is a weird coincidence surely but one that feels profound right now. But <i>Rusty </i>.... I really listened to this a lot in high school. Listening to 'Bible Silver Corner' now, it's like I know every nook and cranny. My teenage mind was blown by this bit of indie classicism, and it feels like I could pick up a guitar right and play the whole thing verbatim, so accurate is my memory of it. Which doesn't end when "proper" Rodan kicks in, with the incendiary 'Shiner' and 'The Everyday World of Bodies' - could a better side one exist? Boy, I loved the shit out of this record and even followed the less interesting post-Rodan projects for awhile, but ultimately this was a unique stroke of genius that would never be repeated. I upgraded to vinyl a few years ago but then the liner notes were just the CD booklet stuck inside the album -- I think this is a repress so maybe Quarterstick just had an overrun of CD booklets and were trying to save money? 'Jungle Jim' is the only weak track and it's still pretty great. All of my teenage idols are falling (Bill Doss left us last week). When I was 17 and worshipped <i>Rusty</i>, I went to see Shipping News at the Beehive in Pittsburgh and talked with Jason Noble afterwards for ages. He wrote me a list of music to check out, which ended up turning me on to Talk Talk's last two albums, gamelan music, Bela Bartok's <i>Divertimento</i>, and I remember the Barry Black album was on the list too. I wrote him a few times by post and we stayed in touch for a little bit. Yet another reason to be sad tonight. [6 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I came to Royal Trux late; my first exposure to their name was in the original 'What is Indie Rock?' flyer Manny handed me at Lollapalooza '93, where it mentioned "prominent national acts like Fugazi and Royal Trux".   At some point in high school, my friend Joe's girlfriend played us a Royal Trux song - I have no idea which one, but I'm guessing it was probably something off <i>Cats and Dogs</i> given the time frame, or maybe one of the major label albums - and we both hated it, saying it was too close to hip-hop (?!).  So I only started to appreciate them when I heard <i>Twin Infinitives</i> at some point around the Arco Flute years - I think I borrowed or took Tamburo's copy which was on CD, with no booklet or liner notes, and the disc was cut into only 4 tracks for the four sides of the LP.  At the time I was dazzled by anything convoluted or inpenetrable, which this record certainly is.  So I considered myself a mild 'fan' of RT but it wasn't until the UK years when hanging around with Warwick led to frequent playing of <i>Accelerator</i> and other more rock-oriented releases.  Now I'm definitely a fan, though I still haven't absorbed their entire discography and lately, it's the two major label records that I'm grooving on the most ('Ray-O-Vac', anyone?).  I grabbed this repress last summer and pulled it out yesterday for a random listen, and I can't say that i have any more insight into it than before.  I do enjoy it, but it's a tough one to spin when you're trying to focus on something else, like coding or writing or filing papers even.  It demands full attention, and then continually shifts whenever you think you've figured out a structure or hook.  I've listened to this a bunch of times but I still can't really hum a melody or probably even recognise it if you played me a snippet.  But the pressing nice and I guess that's a good thing.  [6 May 2011]</p>

The construction of the album is episodic, with wind sounds linking together the songs (recalling the 'burn' feeling) and tortured vocal chants driving it along. None of it makes any sense, despite the relatively traditional instrumentation (up-front percussion keeps this from getting too out of control, and the strings are mostly acoustic). On the middle of side two, a long instrumental jam of overlapping modalities builds into chaos, with distant recordings mixed in the background - animals, domestic sounds, and who knows what else - to create a pretty dazzling quilt. At the time Paradigm issued this, they had no idea who the artists were and the CD traycard contains a plea for contact, but I don't know if that ever happened. I think a vinyl reissue came out more recently but maybe it's just as unofficial - it would be nice to upgrade this, though. [5 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This half-hour mini-album by Marianne Nowottny is a pretty challenging listen, though not intentionally so. Built around organ and Nowottny's weird (but not abrasive) voice, the song structures are so haphazard that the record feels like it's always lurching.  It would be an exaggeration to say that it's teetering on the edge of chaos, but it's really hard to find a centre. Nico is an obvious comparison because their voices are similar and the arrangements have the same dark complexion, but Nowottny is definitely closer to a crackpot coffeehouse open-mic vibe. <i>Afraid Of Me</i> deserves classic status and some of her other experiments have been worthwhile, but <i>Illusions of the Sun</i> just tends to fall into a middle ground.

<p class="p3">Yes.  Siltbreeze has issued a 7" of four pre-Shadow Ring recordings, made in Folkestone by Darren Harris and Graham Lambkin (the Cat and Bells club, supposedly) in 1991.  This is of course of immense interest to Shadow Ring fanatics, and it does not disappoint.  Side 1 captures the barely melodic riffage of the <i>City Lights</i> days, with Harris' inimitable vocal delivery.  The fidelity is excellent - the acoustic plucking and percussive rattling (sounding distinctly like household items) is crisp and clear, and the distorted, dictaphone speech has the same weird essence that <i>Lighthouse</i> does.  'Kent Custer' names the future band, and both tracks capture that slice of modern Britain that I think they capture so well - the everyday strange, the foreboding urbanity.  The musical motifs don't stray near the dark oddness of their later electroacoustic textures, but follow a primitive path not unlike Inca Eyeball, though I think Phil and Joincey didn't start IE until a few years later.  Side two finds a slightly less vocal outing, 'Cave of Ice Cats', really a guitar duet that I can only compare to the Door and the Window or early Jandek, but with a more curved recording quality.  'Father's Dead' ends things, another burst of oddball language.  These are "real" songs, boasts the cover, and my world is a richer place for them.  It's always amazing to hear where genius began, and this is no exception.  [3 July 2010]</p>

Stevie Moore's early recordings than anything else I can think of.  'Ascension' is an amazing, totally fucked up rock song and the bluesy rock jams carry something wholesome as well.  'A Day at the Factory' is as far-out as anything you've ever heard, and while it isn't exactly clear what is Slit and what is pre-Slit, it's all pretty amazingly visionary.  This was slightly on the pricey side for a single LP, but I'm just excited that it's on my turntable.   [9 July 2010] </p>

The majority of this record is actually language-based, in German which I don't understand, and that might be for the better. Otto brings hysterics of all sorts, some piano clanging, and some muttering and walking about. The first side ends with a long track of Muehl doing his thing overtop of the Blue Danube waltz, but avant-garde music is just as much under attack. By the end I'm sick of it, but that's what Aktionism is good for - producing feelings of disgust. Kommissar Hjuler's stuff is really just a continuation of these sounds. [25 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Papercuts Theater </i>is in some ways, a conceptual companion piece to the compilation I put out, <i>Mes Soldats Stupides</i>. Maybe I just see the connection because both titles come from fake movies invented for a Friendster profile a decade ago. But where <i>MSS</i> is a compilation of previously released studio pieces, this is a collection of live recordings, all worked into an epic 4-side seamless piece. The recordings date back to the late 90s and feature just about everyone who Spencer regularly played with as well as some others. The first half is a blast of thick BxC sound, with a fusion/jazz feel at points from Trevor's drumming. This is probably the sound that I'd associate with that show I saw in Louisville with Robert and Mike Shiflet in the band. The process of compiling everything into one mixed piece musta been insane to do (66 recordings were used) but the resulting whole is, while overwhelming, pretty much a 'statement' as anything could be. There's definitely variation in dynamic, but even more noticeable are the variations in density. Sometimes it's a thick screaming miasma of electronics and violin - at other points it's a spacious exploration with tapping and other rustling sounds making it nervous. The thick parts are more smooth than the thin, if that makes any sense. This is inherently a difficult listen but it's a fairly necessary document of the BxC thing, I'd say. [15 September 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">My lord, this just sounds amazing right now.  I can't resist these Ba Da Bing reissues because they sound so good -- though it's been years since I've spun my Siltbreeze issue of <i>Clyma Est Mort</i>.  I think, since the Dead C are one of the best bands ever, that I'll hold onto the original and maybe one day spin them side by side to compare audio quality.  It's funny how few actual memorable "songs" the Dead C had in their prime, as these reissues seem to have endless versions of 'Power', etc.  There's three in particular here, of which the <i>Clyma Est Mort</i> version may be the best ever.  I'm not sure where the <i>Tentative Power</i> tracks come from but every second of this second LP is completely incredible.  I need to sit down and figure out if any of these versions are on the <i>Trapdoor Fucking Exit</i> CD or anything else, but why does it even matter?  When put together as this 6 song, 45 rpm LP, it somehow congeals into the best Dead C record EVER.  'Radiation's got some music concrete bits mixed in and the guitars are all amped up beyond belief, yet really piercing and tinny.  This version of 'Hell is Now Love' is a perfect cacophany.  <i>Clyma</i>'s 'Ein Kampf, Ein Seig' reminisces about the <i>Dead C vs. Sebadoh</i> 7" (speaking of, is that gonna end up on the Ba Da Bing 2LP reissue of <i>Operation of the Sonne</i>?).  It's all just, I dunno, so fucking perfect and anti.  [7 Dec 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">A split release, rather than a collaborative one. Side 1 of this is by Kommissar Hjuler und Frau, but it consists of cutting up and manipulating existing records of American concrete poetry, though it mostly seems to be people introducing the poetry through feedback-enhanced echo, and distorted radio sounds. It's an odd approach to putting something together but Hjuler is a pretty insane artist, at least from the live appearance I saw. It suits the Feeding Tube aesthetic well and mostly is just the phrase "concrete poetry" shouted in various formats, but all is good. Mama Baer's side is a lot more interesting - weird tape loops, broken German speech, howling ... it's a twisted vision and right up my outsider alley. She brings in some creepy singing, and then some chopped-up spoken bits which resemble the concrete poetry referred to on side 1 quite a bit. It's truly fucked up and weird, enough to make you run for the hills, which is probably where these weirdos hail from in the first place. [25 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">I had this 12" on order from Norman records forever but it was late in being released so I eventually gave up and canceled it.  Luckily, VT had it so I could hear the latest installment in the Vermillion Sands saga.  The super fun 60's ye-ye style pop + modern psych style continues, leading off with 'Where Was He From', a surprisingly droney, dark Wall of Sound-style tune that is closer to the Jesus and Mary Chain than I'd ever thought I'd hear from these Eye-talians.  But then the title track crashes in, resuming the bouncy fun that made me fall so completely in love with their debut single.  'I Need No One' is even jumpier and has Anna's sharp voice giving it the strange edge that is part of their sound.  I love it.  Side B opens with a Betty James cover and ends with a jammy instrumental that still has a primitive beat and thick, thick guitars.  The middle section reminds me of Burma's "All World Cowboy Romance" in a way.  Overall the effect reminds me a bit of all those twee Glasgow bands, if only they had a bit more energy and were influenced equally by Sonic Youth and Phil Spector.  Another fine release, still not quite as brililant as the 'Mary' 7", but making me salivate at the thought of a full-length.

<p class="p1">Jesus, it's hard to get through this record. I'm in a mood to tackle box sets today, but <i>Have One On Me</i> is a formidable wall to break through. I feel like I'd have a better time with the much longer Smegma or Tazartes boxes I have. I bought this on the strength of a few songs from the first half of the album - '81' and 'Good Intentions Paving Company' are as perfect as anything she's ever done, even if they've abandoned the quirky caterwauls of <i>Milk-Eyed Mender</i> for a more sophisticated <i>Ladies of the Canyon</i> vibe. But that's fine - 'Good Intentions' is a stunner, with an ascending momentum that never gives into to the impulse of its own tension. Many others, however, fail to make this distinction - 'In California' goes on forever, like a reminder that the record is only half over even though it feels like you've been listening to it forever. There's something depressingly bland about the whole album - from the Drag City session musicians (an approach which worked magic for Silver Jews with <i>The Natural Bridge</i>, but here they fail to carry across any personality besides competence, and these are totally different guys anyway) to the ugly artwork and dull graphic design - it makes the less compelling songs fade away even before they are over, and the most ambitious ones (like the impenetrable title track) just tedious. The solo voice and harp tracks are actually more distinct, despite the orchestral provocations occasionally being stirring. 'Jackrabbits' is probably the highlight, if you can handle the Biblical references and the word 'darlin' thrown about so much. The last three sides are pretty much a snooze, though there's occasional delicate bits that recall the fractured beauty of her earliest work - 'Ribbon Bows' and 'Kingfisher' have it, though it's hard to stay engaged by this point. The odd word choices, rooted in naturalistic wonder, become too much -- seriously, get a fucking editor! I hate to rag on this so much but if it were a single LP it would be such an accomplishment, but overall <i>Have One On Me</i> ends up being the <i>Sandanista!</i> of its generation.

Rob sings with such an exaggerated Scottish accent that this could never be mistaken for any other origin. The second side starts to hint at some real paranoia, 'Stark Real' in particular.

<p class="p1">Subliminal Sounds put out this collection of the recordings of the Pärson Sound, the legendary Swedish heavy psych band from the laet 60s. I was way into these recordings back in my post-University days in Pittsburgh, when they were issued as a double CD and became part of the hyped up wave of psychedelic/folk reissues. Having this on vinyl is a joy; it sounds great, and the thick, heavy jams are quite a lot to listen to despite the recording fidelity, which is a feat of mastering. This is heavy crazed Scandinavian farm drone, and despite the appearance of instruments like cellos and saxophones, there's little resemblance to free jazz or anything else happening at the time - even compared to something like Amon Düül 1, Pärson Sound were more focused at their craft. Most of these recordings are very long - 1 or 2 tracks per side - and many taken from various happenings in Sweden in those years, such as museum shows and festivals, making this a pretty important historical document as well as something worthwhile to listen to. I like this material better than anything ever released by Harvester/Träd, Gräs &amp; Stenar, maybe because it's not held back by lyrics or songs, really just being an intense, almost cult-like trip.

'Durango's Hornpipe' is a perfect instrumental and 'Rise Above It' takes so long to end that it's majestic.

<p class="p1"><i>The Naked Shakespeare</i> finds Blegvad at his most eclectic. Working closely with John Greaves as well as XTC's Colin Moulding/Andy Partridge and Anton Fier, this is a great lineup for interpreting his oddball pop songs. There's thick guitar roasts on 'How Beautiful You Are', synth experiments on the (very dark, disturbing) 'Irma', and even a marching band on 'Vermont'. The lyrics are a bit more cryptic than the Slapp Happy days, though still rich with invention, and 'Blue-Eyed William' is reinvented here. Something more contemplative is afoot, even though he sounds like he's having fun singing these. Love and loss is a present theme, which is the fundamental basis of most rock music, but in Blegvad's hands it becomes something else. 'Lonely Too' interjects a commentary during a verse which somehow is more aorta than cerebellum, despite the intellect that went into the construction. It actually took me years to really appreciate the genius of <i>Acnalbasac Noom</i>; I don't think any Blegvad is quite as immediate as his <i>Leviathan</i> comic strips, but that's OK cause I like the slow reward.

<p class="p1">Mid-80s Blegvad has that bright, sharp production that characterises music of its period: loud, bold drums that sound nothing like drums, thick backing vocals, and a crunch layered in something shimmery. There's a lyrics sheet so that helps with the songs, which are always central to Blegvad. A few touch on something quite powerful - 'The Incinerator' is a really genuine ode to love and loss, though the spry production seems inappropriate. 'Face Off' is about someone ripping off another's face; 'Last Man' is about the last man on earth - so there's some dark territory here, for sure. The band is unremarkable, steering him away from the cabaret-pop influence that made Slapp Happy so brilliant. The tone is pretty uneven despite the lyrical focus, and even the closing cut, 'Marlene' (a beautiful, brilliantly written song about loss) can't be saved from an average performance.

There's some classics here - 'Lo Boob Oscillator', 'John Cage Bubblegum', and the Nurse With Wound collaboration 'Animal or Vegetable' which takes up the entirety of side three. Some of the songs are just so incredibly French sounding, thanks to Laetitia Sadier's sweet voice; 'Tone Burst (Country)' actually sounds like something you could hear from a French street musician, except not really cause it's still Stereolab. This is material right before they hit their master stride (<i>Mars Audiac Quintet, Transient Random Noise Bursts</i> -- which have both been reissued lately on vinyl, so I should scoop 'em up) and there's a penultimate truth at play here.

When I saw him live, he added a manic Pere Ubu edge to the Taurpis Tula set; on its own, it's a more challenging listen but then I don't come to Ultra Eczema releases for being easy. He had a double CDr on this label before which was supposed to be more collage-based tape work, but I never managed to snag a copy before they diappeared (though I had my chances). He's got a lot more to explore in his discography but while I like this LP, I'm more curious about the collage-based material because I don't need any more records that sound like this.

<p class="p1">Dennis sold me this cheap because he was having trouble selling them. I wonder why a double LP compilation of 'Popcorn' covers wouldn't fly off the shelves? Also, since there's about 40 different artists on here, I think he gave out royalty copies and hardly had any left. It's a tremendously stupid record, and it's hard to listen to; despite the diversity of the sounds, the recurring melody eventually makes you nuts. So many of my friends appear on this it's ridiculous - and there's lots of different takes, some fairly straight, some only loosely related (and a few that actually use the sound of popcorn being popped). But it's also a neat snapshot of my musical world, or at least the people I hung around for a few years. [26 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">I've been trying to get the 'essential' Stereolab records from eBay lately - ever since Caleb was rocking 'Refried Ectoplasm' on his laptop speakers in Mooste, I've been having a huge Stereolab revival.  This is a pretty phenomenal selection of music, presented in a beautiful triple LP/double gatefold with screened covers.  I don't know any of the material from this but that's because it's all singles, b-sides, and outtakes, from their most rewarding period of activity.  There's a lot of amazing songs and I'd maybe say they get a lot more experimental here than on the albums ('One Note Samba' which is playing as I type this is particularly amazing); there's a few tracks that are just sketches and they're pretty nice too, and indiciate a bit of what it must be like in the studio with Tim Gane.  At £18 including shipping, this was really a bargain; I think this might be a nice time to get old Stereolab records cheap, as they are too recent to be trendy again and there's something a bit unhip about it.  I want to get <i>Mars Audiac Quintet</i>, <i>Transient Random Noise Bursts</i> and most of all, <i>Dots &amp; Loops</i> before I quit.  And maybe <i>Cobra and Phases</i> if that's easy to find on vinyl.</p>

<p class="p1">A reissue of a live CDr, this has mixed fidelity and presumably recording dates too, and that's exactly what makes it so special. The second track is so overdriven that the saxes sound more like a children's toy, or a broken kazoo. Jaakko pounds away with that bursty, rolling rumble he does that no one else, not even Corsano, can approximate. As explosive as this band is live (at least from the one awesome time I've seen 'em), the quiet bits here really scream - weird vocals-thorugh-sax, small Art Ensemble sounds, occasional shrill hiss - I think there's a lot of instrumentation not listed here. Listening to this makes me really miss Finland and how lucky I was to be around musicians like this; crazy that I've only seen Lauhkeat Lampaat once, because I should have taken every opportunity for it (though maybe they've only actually played properly once since I moved there). I need to push myself back up there into this jazzworld because I can't get any taste of it here - what Estonian improvised music I've seen, when good, has been pretty far away from this pulse.

<p class="p3"><i>Harvest of Dreams</i>!  What a record, and one where Trimble's voice is attenuated to a shrill, focused banshee wail.  'If Words Were All I Had' is pretty brilliant and balancing the trebly Trimble treble with the same fractured warble that makes Buckley's 'Song to the Siren' so great.  This is a really complex and weird album, which also repeats 'Premonitions' like <i>Iron Curtain Innocence</i> repeats 'One Mile from Heaven' -- except these are really two different versions, and 'Premonitions' is probably my favourite Bobb Trimble song, so I don't mind hearing it twice.  There's a lot of flanger, phaser and effects here but it still sounds like one man's personal vision at all times.  It's definitely more eclectic than the first one and definitely there's more to unravel here.  The silence track sounds great on vinyl cause of course it's not silent (and makes me realise it might be time to get a new stylus).  [5 Oct 2010]</p>

<p class="p1">Reviewing a quadruple LP properly is a time-consuming activity, especially one from a single artist. This came out on CD at the same time as the Lily Greenham issue, also on Paradigm, and I was thrilled to discover both artists. It's fascinating how many women were working on the margins of experimental sound, especially sound like this which crosses over between electronic/synth composition to sound poetry to improvisation. Oram's work is a bit less vocally driven than Greenham's, but I'm really only comparing them because they were released around the same time. The four sides of this are continually provocative, with sci-fi dreamscapes, verbal glossolalia, and fairly dissonant noise workouts. It's too much to listen to in one sitting - even on CD, this has so many different pieces, being essentially a review of her entire career, that it's best taken in parts. The liner notes are spares, just directing me to a website, but the photos add to this sense of mid-century Americana that infuses her work. A photo of a woman with a conservative hairstyle and glasses in a 1950's-style housedress bent over a Uher reel-to-reel is almost comical, and I'm sorry it adds so much to the enjoyment of this as pure sounds, but it does.

<p class="p3">Richard and Paz release a ton of CDrs that I never have heard, and I figured this was weird considering how I love most of Richard's other collaborations.  So I took a gamble on this one and found something that was surprisingly clean and restrained, yet clearly casual.  There's a lot of hard-edged rhythm here, but very slow, and in the space between you can really feel the digitally-recorded acoustics.  The first and last tracks are the longest and maybe form a bit of a shell around the shorter tracks in the middle, but when it's over I'm left feeling like there was nothing essential whatsoever here.  Paz is a pretty awesome guy (at least from what I remember, the one time we hung out) and maybe I should investigate the other 25 cdr releases they do together, but with all of the other Youngs product out there (not to mention the boatloads of non-Youngs records I have to listen to) it's probably not going to be high on my priorities.

<p class="p3">Deerhunter have slowly and gradually become perhaps my favourite existing indierock/mainstream/whatever band, though this happened quite gradually over the past few years, and I still haven't really dived headfirst into their world like I used to.  I chalk that up partially to age and saturation, and partially to the time required to really extract pleasure from their music.  <i>Microcastle</i> eventually became a fave once I really started to feel the layers of misery underneath the surface sounds - unlike their first record or that amazing <i>Flourescent Gray EP</i>, this was a record that revealed its genius between the lines.  <i>Halcyon Digest</i> is even more subtle in its beauty.  In fact, writing these comments after only three listens is kinda funny because I think (providing I give it the time that it warrants) I will love this record immensely in two years.  On the surface this is far more restrained, a low-key third album (maybe a bit like the Velvet Underground's third or the Mekons <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>).  The songs are very, very strong and a bit more accessible than anything before, and recorded wonderfully (4AD's white vinyl pressing sounds great, with the distorted vocals and warm acoustics amped up to recall the same sentimental memories of teenage years spent listening to R.E.M. and Pavement).  This may almost sound like a step backwards from the ambient/punk textures they explored before, except they've actually managed to integrate them into the songs as a more cohesive unit.  The two songs that are written by the other guy are both amazing - bright and warm, and recalling something familiar without being derivative.  The title suggests a more peaceful place, and though I haven't really dug into any lyrics yet, I'm already feeling themes of religion, loss, and wasted youth, which isn't anything groundbreaking for Deerhunter -- but I suspect as I further lose myself in this well of nostalgia, I'll probably feel the true melanchollia that I know is lurking.  Many artists write dark, sad songs, but Deerhunter expresses pain in such a genuine, under-the-surface way, that I feel like it's better to compare them to Alex Chilton on Big Star's third album than to something overtly down n' out.  Let's let the bad times roll.  [11 October 2010] </p>
<p class="p3">I was right; two years later I love this record immensely and still listen to it constantly. 'Memory Boy' might be my top rock song of the past few years. [30 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p3">Holy shit, Jan has made something really truly incredible here.  And in a way, it's sorta slipping under the radar.  It's weird to finally hear this in October, when I actually hosted the record release listening party.  But I actually didn't hear the record at all when this happened - I was stuck in Ptarmigan making sushi while he played it for the audience of about 60 people, so I really just felt the vibrations through the wall.  I decided to wait for the vinyl to appear and then I forgot about it, until I became too embarrassed to ask Jan for a copy or buy it locally. So I imported it to Finland, which is kinda stupid.  And I finally got to sit down and listen to it, and I'm actually totally blown away by this.  This is a true work of genius, a densely layered, meticulously arranged masterpiece of sound.  I've only been sorta-into KY before, preferring Jan's solo vision, but this is really that -- just utilising the contributions of lots of lots of friends (Roope, Jaakko Tolvi, Carole and Koji, and pretty much everyone else I know).  This defies any sort of classification as psychedelic music, freak-folk, electro-acoustic, etc. -- it's really a beast of its own, providing a million twists and turns.  It's an audio maze, with an almost ludicrous attention to detail and a masterful touch of editing.  I think by this point the greater musical world isn't paying much attention to what's going on in Finland, which means this will probably escape the attention it deserves, or it will be unfairly marginalised as being part of that whole scene that people were into 5 years ago.  But that's fine with me, because it will honestly take me years to unravel this and every listen will be a new thrill.  [11 October 2010] </p>

<p class="p1">My god, have I grown to love this record.  I remember when Richard originally did it as a limited CDr through Volcanic Tongue and the team was ranting in their update about how brilliant it was ... I downloaded it and thought it was OK but didn't compare to my favourite song-based Richard stuff.  But now, after spending a good year listening to it frequently (while driving) it's become a singalong favourite.  When Tuukka visited last summer he told me how the last live show he saw, Richard was just doing karaoke to the whole album and trying to get the audience to sing along.  How I would have loved that!  I love belting out 'Collapsing Stars', and 'Summer Void' is probably my overall favourite, but every song is worth singing along to.  There's a lot of complexity and quite a lot of styles influencing this, which really does stand apart from his other work.  The electro influence is not insignificant but it still retains that downhome folky feel of <i>Sapphie</i> or <i>New Angloid Sound</i>.  It's impossible to say what's the best Richard Youngs album but this is unquestionably a milestone in his career, though because I'm already a somewhat obsessive fan, maybe this is just me.  [24 May 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>20 Years</i> package is not just an LP but an LP with three bonus CDs, so it's a ton to digest. <i>20 Years</i> itself commemorates Richard and Simon's long-running relationship with a series of short sketches, very electronic-tinged, that remind me somewhat of <i>Metallic Sonatas</i>. 'Silence', for example, is anything but - it's a buzz-saw of exploratory assonance. <i>Songphase</i> is the most celebrated CD here - 10 great pop songs from 1996, never released before for some crazy reason. This has the shimmer/shoegaze buzz throughout and an earnest, reverb-laden Richard singing throughout. 'West of the City' is bright and sweet; 'Dream Song' is exactly that. The live CD has dark, cloudy explorations and gothic Casio-beat songforms; it's recorded pretty well so is maybe a good example of these guys experimenting without the benefit of overdubs. But the real gem might be <i>SMIRR</i>, four tracks cut in 1995 that are absolutely beautiful, built around an electroacoustic strum. Liner notes by Marc Masters, Neil Campbell and David Keenan, but my one complaint is that the CDs all got scratched when I slid them out of their cardboard sleeves. [30 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Every year for 5 years, R!!! and S!!! bashed out a track which was released in 2006 on this CD. It's interesting how similar these tracks sound - they could have been recorded all at the same time, for they all tend to be electro-acoustic ecstatic madness in the same vein - a vein they have mined before, for sure, but not as completely distinct as here. The car-alarm synths in '2003'  become pretty abrasive, definitely a callback to <i>Metallic Sonatas</i>; '2004' is a tremelo effect taken to the extreme, which is disorientating and brilliant. Of the many many of Richard's albums I've accumulated over the years this is one I tend to forget about, falling into the lower 10-15 that I rarely listen to. But all of those, for the most part, have their rewards, and this is no exception. [24 December 2012]</p>

This is the Bobby Brown record that made his name (if he actually made any sort of name beyond being the Beach Boys' drug dealer) though <i>Prayers of the One Man Band</i> is the album that I truly love. If I hadn't fallen for that one first, I would probably be crazy about <i>Axonda</i>, but it's somewhat less accessible and much more far-out, without as much calypso influence. The songs are not quite as catchy, but much more serious in their conveyance of the truth of Axonda, or whatever, and I eat this shit up with a spoon. [26 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is the end, I'm afraid, and I find this impossible to play without getting sad. If this is a true tribute to Charles Gocher then it's appropriate in tone, for sadness saturates <i>Funeral Mariachi</i>, their final album, and I think one of their definitive works. I'm not sure how much was assembled in the studio posthumously (as this came out 3 years after his death) but it's magical in a way that nothing else they ever recorded is. There's madcap surrealism, ethnoforgeries, surreal songs, and unexpected soundtracks of pure beauty, sure. But unlike the other million albums they released, there's a sense of true development here - the band is not repeating themselves at all, but instead showing what could have been, which makes it even more devastating to listen to. As the title indicates there is a funereal mood here - lots of piano, at times making this stunningly 'inside' ('Mineral Wells' and 'Vine Street Piano' are chillingly accessible, the later accentuated with Eyvind Kang's viola). But there's also tracks like 'Ben's Radio' that show the musical brilliance that SCG were capable of practically phoning in. 'The Imam' is full of falsetto vocals in a made up language, yet it's striking how much I am moved by it, despite how ridiculous it is. 'Holy Ground' could be a blueprint for a new genre of songwriting, if anyone wanted to pick up the lead.  Maybe this is overall their most mellow release, but it succeeds in being an elegant, graceful swan song without compromising any of the nonsense that made this band so brilliant. The closing track, 'Funeral Mariachi', sends off their legacy through a ghostly echo, smirking as it fades into the distance, while tears rumble in my eyes. [23 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Tim Goss's first solo album under the name Call Back the Giants isn't incredibly surprising if you're familiar with his work in the Shadow Ring, especially <i>I'm Some Songs</i>. Much of the album is built around minimalist synth and odd ambience, with the occasional vocal (in a downtrodden, processed and generally WTF manner). I don't really think of this as anything like all those other minimal synth artists (Oneohtrixpoint Never, for example) because this has that otherwordlyness that is on another plane entirely, like most of the Kye roster. 'My Brother' ends the record in a really contemplative mood, with twinkling stars. Their second one got a bit more attention but I still haven't listened to it. [2 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: €25.99</p>
<p class="p1">This is a box set of the first four Prisonshake 7"s, an excellent and varied introduction to the early period of this most underreated band. The first EP, "Fairfield Avenue Serenade", has that great Midwest guitar-balladry that 80's indie rock is capable of. Doug Enkler joined as vocalist for the second 7" and instantly the songs take on a more anthemic quality that reminds me greatly of early Silkworm - fun, energetic, and somehow serious at the same time. The B-side contains a bunch of overlapping fragmentary songs, split between the left and right speakers, a good experiment that I decided to listen to all at once, which makes a cool sea of indierock mess (but with some nice overlapping phase serendipities at time) The 'Deanna' 45 is the closest to mature period Prisonshake, though still a bit ragged, and the last 7" is a pure experiment of genres and goofing around, which is fun but a bit like filler. This is somewhat annoying to listen to, with the constant flipping and speed-changing, but would be a good collection to have as a standalone album, which I doubt will ever happen since no one really cares about Prisonshake.

<p class="p1">A new Cheveu record is cause for celebration, though oddly I never picked up the <i>Cheveau</i> release, leaving a large hole in my collecting of this band (one of the few contemporaries who I feel compelled to get everything by).  <i>Mille</i> is a huge step forward, as Agent Royalty already commented on.  The basic sound of their first record was probably starting to feel like a dead end, but there's still many elements from it - synth drums, manic vocal glossolalia, and edgy yet strangely familiar guitar licks.  There's actually a string section on some tracks, and 'No Birds' emerges as a real masterpiece, with crossover hit potential.  'Like a Deer in the Headlights' was a single I got almost 2 years ago, and this appears on side two, and is really a blueprint for the new direction.  Better production, more confidence, and they're taking chances - I'm totally delighted by <i>Mille</i> and I think it will ultimately eclipse the first album for me.  'Charlie Sheen' is an awesome song with a great thrashy breakdown which is particularly relevant given Mr. Sheen's recent activities.  [3 March 2011]</p>

At one listen there's stuff like 'Sunrise' - a totally expansive, psychedelic soundscape that really sets the mood, in the middle of the album; also 'You're Bringing Me Down' which feels like a compendium of druggy effects centered around vocal monotony.  I think this guy is from Portland, or maybe I just assume that cause Pete Swanson mastered it.  I can certainly feel this coming out of the same scene that produced Eat Skull, as there's a similar approach, just minus all the punk.  I think I like this though, and will probably listen to it lots.</p>

<p class="p1">It's been ages since I've bought an ultra-limited art edition VtB release but I'm not sure why I went for this - maybe just for nostalgia's sake, and because I like Nick's art. This is very nicely put together - not over the top like <i>The Mountains Among Us </i>was, but just generally a clean, elegant package. The music appears to be Paddenless-VtB, recorded over past years and collaged together into a series of untitled tracks. There's a lot of looping, circular sounds here using keyboards, synths, and clatter, and very little voice. Taken as a whole it feels like a collage, but the individual tracks work as short pieces; as fragments and ideas that assemble into a whole. It's a different direction for them, I guess, though it's also maybe a bit less distinct, lacking their original surreal, alien approach to construction. [24 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Dave from Car Commercials/Ladderwoe sent this to check in with me since we had been out of touch for awhile. Have I ever expressed how brilliant and fucked I think this guy's music is? <i>American Wildlife</i> picks up from the Ladderwoe vibe of a complete anti-aesthetic with something direct about it. This is from that genre of electro-acoustic weirdness that I try to work in with my own solo stuff (or at least <i>Boat Trip</i>), though this blows away anything I could do. The obvious comparison is Lambkin's <i>Salmon Run,</i> especially in the way there are small, fuzzy domestic sounds meeting electronics meeting sampled neo-classical beauty. But there's a really distinct vibe here, and as the disc goes on, I'm more and more baffled by it, which means I am more in love with it. Maybe it's time to relaunch the aborted Drake Pun Element project. This probably got little or no attention, which is a shame because it's so insanely great.

It's a highlight for sure, and the thick, distant drone that comprises their second track (like a mellower Skaters, maybe) is also lovely, but when it gets back to the more spare plinks and plucks, I'm a bit more interested. Waterfinder is McDowell and Jackie, husband and wife and dear friends of mine. This beings in a sinister tone, with an ominous, unresolved drone hanging over some creepy vocals. This moves into some scraping bowed violins or other such strings, and it has that tense-but-ramshackle feeling that I like so much. Over the half-hour, the McDowells move around a variety of sounds, all rooted in acoustic clouds. There's some vocal experiments, some tentative plucking, some pulsing tape-motor, and an overall feeling of communication. [31 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I enjoyed hanging out with Stephen Cornford and I also enjoy his recordings, which are very much demonstrations of sound-generating projects he did. Sound art, of course. The first side of this 7" is neutral sounding rotating drone, with a few different physical layers - probably ceramics and string - before it clicks into place and a deeper, more resonating drone (like a Tibetan prayer bowl) takes over. Side two is a bit more clangy, with bell sounds reverberating semi randomly, suggesting they are tied up and left to dangle from the turntable's motion. [16 December 2012]</p>

Side 1 is built around a tape echo on I think blank tape, which produces a whistling, flutey owl sound - over which various nervous jittery sounds come and go. On the flip, Steve gets a bit more miasmic and visceral; the instrument there is credited as 'galvanized extraction duct'. Of course. [14 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">An early Pascal Comelade project, Fall of Saigon is most easily compared to Young Marble Giants, for the formula is the same - simple bass lines, keyboards, and small songs led by a sweet, world-weary female vocalist. But there's a bit more diversity here - some dark, pulsing synths and some songs sung by guitarist Terry Den, who's 'She Leaves Me All Alone' is a highlight for sure. There's a couple cover versions - 'The End' which is closer to Nico than the Doors,and 'Part Time Punks' by Television Personalities, which is nice in this French early 80s context. Despite the spare palette, Fall of Saigon do a lot with a little and this is a very rewarding glimpse of English-language French post-punk. [21 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is such an NWW-list classic that I've always taken it a bit for granted. It's surely a compendium of weird sounds from the 1970s, dipping into genre excursions at times. There's a lot of left-field sound fuckery - more primitive and lumbering than Berrocal, but more experimental than Faust. Mostly conventional rock instruments are at play, though there's some plucked strings that sound more ethnic and there's a sense that they'd do anything to avoid tradition. When it does sound like a rock band, there's actually a few psychedelic guitar solos, snappy drumming, and some vague song structures. <i>Trixie Stapelton 291</i> is an album of sketches; vocals, scrapes, dog barks, and bells are all just additional colourings. The mix of 'band' moments and more abstract, weird soundforms is what makes the record overall so effective - it's a real pastiche of 'anything goes' exploration, yet still with a vision.

<p class="p1"><i>Ongaku</i> is the Japanese word for 'music' if I recall correctly, but these recordings, made in the early 1960's, are as radical of a redefinition of what music is as anything imaginable. The three compositions have a similarity to Fluxus scores but sound-wise, they are insane, even beyond what you would expect. These lengthy pieces are some of the most genuinely "non-idiomatic" improvisations I've ever heard. I could try to pick out sources - strings, pianos, tapes, radios, electronics - but it's really irrelevant. The key to me is the aesthetic, one which over 50 years later is still untouchable -- and the sense of group interplay. My tastes in outsider/experimental music are easy to pin down - I like feeling some balance between complete anti-establishment innovation and universal structures that are identifiable as 'music'. I think you get that here through the idea of the group, an important part of the ensemble's name. There is a world of interplay between these different musicians, and something expressive beyond "let's destroy music" or "isn't this experimental". By this I mean motion, tension, dynamic, and juxtaposition, all of which are in full-force throughout the diverse sounds of these 3 pieces. [23 November 2012]</p>

Cassettes are the core of this - a very manipulated and strange approach to sound construction, which is really tape heavy, but also with breathing, vocal murmurs, and lots of broken pause-button edits. I don't think voice is the entire source material - there's some definite electronics, though it's underplayed in favour of the voice material. There's a bonus track not on the original cassette, 'You', which is almost pure static atmosphere, with the barest bumps of activity. [1 November 2012]</p>

Vlasman sounds pretty mental when he sings, but when he shuts up and plays his guitar, like on the epic 'Fight With a Circular Course', it's like nothing else. Despite all the acoustic guitar wizards that have risen from history, Vlasman doesn't really sound like anyone else. He's not technically stunning on that track, but the atmosphere/mood is unbeatable - utterly distraught, with Eastern influences (percussion that takes a backseat), like a stoned, slow Sandy Bull. It gets more impressive on the flip, with a ragged, fast fingerpicking style. His cover of 'Pale Blue Eyes' pushes things into the outsider territory, mostly due to his singing style, which isn't terrible but certainly bizarre. I didn't think much of this when I first got it, but on a fresh listen it sounds fantastic. [25 September 2012]</p>

This is a legendary record of Finnish outsider music, and I actually met the guy responsible once but I can't remember where - I just remember him coming up to me, probably some Ptarmigan event, and telling me how he was the guy that made the Sperm LP back in 1970. This is actually a fairly restrained and minimal bit of weirdness - most of side A could fit on the late 90's Kranky roster, with lots of soft, low drones to set an unsettling mood. There's definitely a strong influence of free improvisation, but contained into a patchwork of misuse. This really does sound like a prototype for a lot of the Lal Lal Lal artists 40 years later, even though that's an easy comparison to make cause Finland is so small. [15 November 2012]</p>

There's a rolling bassline and some excursions into fuzzy guitars and other noisemakers that makes this much closer to the United States of America (or that one Peter Ivers Band album that I like) than any German kozmikmusiche of that time. The vocals aren't super memorable but the fun jammy bits are great, not too heavy or experimental but also pleasantly weird, especially when some studio trickery is involved. One comparison is actually the Howling Hex work, though it's maybe not quite as goofy - and actually a bit more loose. The vocals are totally easy to ignore and they left no impression on me, and that's actually quite nice here. The last track in particular is a great swampy jam with spazzy too-much-coffee guitar - which really sounds like nothing else. [23 July 2012]</p>

Andre Foisy, on the flip, creates a strange, dense sound piece that builds up electronics and organic sounds into a very voice-laden hurricane. The final moments are like something out of THX1138.

The production and predilection for repetitive, instrumental bits puts it closer to the 'psychedelic' side than 'straight', but do the two have to be opposed? The banjo playing is rhytmic, not particularly traditional in style, and leads to a solid pulsebeat and cohesion. The songs are catchy, and there's a really nice atmosphere to it all. I could easily fall in love with this tape, especially the bits that remind me of the Homosexuals and Brian Eno (most of side two, really). [18 September 2012]</p>

The source instruments are mostly acoustic, and some parts (particularly side C) reminds me of the experiments of Asmus Tietchens - they aren't afraid to drop a coherent moment in favor of something a bit more fragemented, if it means they can try something else. By the end of this I'm very impressed, especially at the dedication to the cassette format, which is not as high-quality in terms of fidelity but provides a nicely structured package for this.

<p class="p1">Mixed psychedelia from Phil French, proprietor of Stunned Records, and William Giacchi. <i>Multitudes</i> is extremely swirly instrumental music, with soft-toned keyboards, layered vocals, and light percussive elements such as bells and other patter. It flows seamlessly, getting a trippy underwater vibe underway on tracks such as 'The View' and never showing it's hand completely. As mysterious as it gets, it stick to a vaguely pastoral atmosphere, and it's a good voyage, if a bit indistinct. [29 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I love this 7", two songs by Spencer that find him exploring his songwriting side. 'In the Blink of an Eye' is an insanely catchy, simple song that hints at a domestic darkness underneath.  It's great, but the b-side, 'Condo Stress', is the real treasure map. I can hear so many of his influences here, particularly Smog and Drag City-label stuff, but there's really a brilliant, unique take on everything. It's a mystery, an emotional enigma, and laid out completely straight-forward over an electric piano line. I need to get his whole song-based album that is now out. [10 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">SYCH is an acronym for Shoup, Yeh, Corsano and Horist, and this is one of the more overtly blues/jazz-based recordings I've ever heard Spencer play on.  This is due to Shoup and Horist, who tend to hit these moody, modal intervals throughout, most notably on the first side. Spencer and Corsano have such a good dialogue at this point but it feels cohesive, and not like two duos.  Horist's guitar is great against the vocal section Spencer drops, and the free-for-all 'Qoph Odyssey' on side two is sadly too short.  [7 June 2011]</p>

<p class="p1">A nice What The... release with a full colour cover, <i>Spitfire</i> presents the distinct saxophone style of Don Dietrich against Ben Hall's flowing drumming. This is a fairly clean recording, with a lot of space for both musicians to work off each other. Dietrich is a hellbeast of a player, but he's able to effortlessly slide between the 'jazz' feel and a more wall-of-sound noise approach (which I'm more used to hearing him do with Bortbeomagus). Over the two sides of this he does both of these things, but does not dominate - it really is a fair split in screen time across the two. The pulse is relentless, and when Dietrich mellows out for just a bit at the beginning of side two, it's not long before he amps up the dissonance and finishes the set with pure ferocity. This gets filed between the Dictators and Durutti Column, heh. [2 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I've had a real resurgence of interest in Trumans Water this year.  I saw them in 1993 I think, and again around 2000 at the MIT, but I have no memories of them as a live band.  They're one of those bands that I was always aware of, but sorta slipped through my cracks (and also I think I was wary because of the Christian thing with Soul Junk, which doesn't bother me anymore).  So revisiting Trumans Water now is fun, especially as their records are relatively easy to find because there's nothing collectible or hip about them (yet).  <i>Godspeed the Punchline</i> is a really solid record, which has some great instrumental freakouts between the carefully constructed songs.  I still don't really understand where to place their sound.  They were from San Diego and play a punk/hardcore-influenced art-rock style, but they don't remind me of Antioch Arrow or Heroin at all.  But they do sort of remind me of Harriet the Spy.  There's more of a Beefheart edge than any of those bands, and the often double-tracked vocals that give it a frantic, yelpy style.  Though it's mostly hard and fast, there are moments that things get more lyrical.  I think the production is better on this one than on <i>Spasm Smash</i> which might be another reason I like it the most (so far).  But there's a pretty massive discography to investigate.  [20 Dec 2011]</p>

His singing voice is actually a lot like his brother's, but I guess they share a lot of DNA. But while Refrigerator constructs measured, emotional indie-rock anthems (at least as their career progresses), Paste is unsurprisingly much more free-form. A lof of <i>Silverwood</i> finds Callaci banging on an acoustic guitar and singing almost Jandek-style, except with lyrics easier to connect to. The straight folk-forms feel like a Refrigerator record and this is probably exactly why these things are called "side projects" - it's like an appetiser besides the main course. Paste hasn't released anything in over 15 years so maybe Refrigerator has been the only outlet Dennis has needed since. [8 November 2012]</p>

This is I think a live recording, as its recorded in a coffee shop that is now closed, but maybe it was just recorded there without an audience. The fidelity is crisp, though it sounds like a room recording - no distortion, and everything is very loud and up-front. The two long tracks feature these guys doing more of what they did in Arco more than their later work, meaning this is very acoustic/folk-based space/drone. The second track starts off with some lovely dulcimer and banjo interactions, which does actually remind me a bit of the Sagas records McDowell has made. It's really jammy in a faux-middle eastern way, until it eventually falls apart and becomes the harmonious drone style of track 1. There's a more manic edge to this one though, and I take it over the first track because I like that intensity more than the sense of wonder conveyed before. I'm not nearly as interested in music like this anymore but these guys certainly do it well. [8 Aug 2012]</p>

This is a drummerless Working Poor, a quartet with Greg Pierce on electric guitar, and I like it, though not quite as much as the <i>New Wealth</i> lineup. The songs are a mix of faves and some new ones, and some Anita Fix songs I guess, spread over two discs yet it doesn't feel overly long. I love Alan's songs so much and this is a really valuable recording to have - there's great versions of 'Love is Fey', 'Seratonin', and 'Kiss Me Twice' on here, and some fun new ones I wasn't familiar with like 'Sexy'.

It's all rooted around guitars, sometimes with backwards effects and other processing of the time, and young, nieve English vocalising. The blues licks are throughout but this trio crunches along nicely, and some of the more stripped down, eager songs like 'There Are No Greater Heroes' for some reason transcend the trappings of the time period. 'Snowdon Song' and 'Sargasso Sea' are absolutely great; 'Dont Sing This Song' is even more awesome, and has a goofy Holy Modal Rounders meet the Incredible String Band feel.

<p class="p1">Columbus has produced some interesting music in the last few years, and El Jesus de Magico is near the top of the class for me. <i>Scalping the Guru</i> has a fragmented, exploratory feel like the best Krautrock (Faust!) but without a retro effect. This is psychedelic rock music, but with Throbbing Gristle-like diversions into the dark static world; it's not noise-based, but rather a controlled form of chaos. The vocals are lazy, sung through the side of the mouth, and creating mood more than anything ('Summer of Luhv' reminds me of the Dead C, but if they were American). There's more to this than attitude and collage - 'Elohim City' closes out on a jangly jam and attains a true beauty. As a representative of the past few years of underground midwest Rock, this is a fantastic example. [8 November 2012]</p>

This actually comes mostly from Nashville, and it's a reissue of Al Martin's home-recorded material from the mid-1980s. On the surface this is fun, goofy home-recorded psych-pop, reminding me structurally of early Sebadoh (<i>The Freed Man, </i>especially) but without any of the somber parts. There's outright jokes, like singing about banging the girls from Gilligan's Island, but then there's also brilliant, dark psych like 'City of Sorrow' and perect pop like 'Goodbye Princess' and 'Wonder Where You've Been'. This features a lot of the names associated with that scene - Thomas Jay Jones, Jim Shepard - and makes a lot of sense to reissue now, alongside the contemporary psych soundworlds.

The best track is a long, repetitive jam on side one that stays crisp with the rhythm guitar, yelping vocals, and more colourful keyboards on top. This isn't half as amateurish as it sounds, but totally fun and delicately constructed to sound casual. There are some great spacey guitar jams, recalling the murky impressionism of great Kiwi music but with a somewhat more 'fun' feel.

I mean, 'Come Out Of Her' and 'Eye of the Hurricane' are absolutely devastating, and I say this as someone who isn't even that into heavy, slow rock. The second side begins with the singer sounding a little bit like 90s alternarocker style vocalists, but it doesn't bother me at all. Though like Collective Soul, Fraction were Christians.

It's a simple concept - a song on vocals on piano that is transformed through three iterations, adding clarinet and electric guitar. As a minimalist statement it's unlike anything else he's ever done, even the rolling <i>Sapphie</i>, the expansive <i>Knish</i> or the fluid <i>Asthma and Diabetes</i>. This is not mere repetition, but extension through iteration. The simple piano figure, which is probably just a loop, drills into my brain and creates a contrast to the stretching, sinewy clarinets and the psychedelic heavyness of the guitars.

Hooray for DIY economics though. <i>Angel</i> starts with a very slow, quiet drone before erupting into a flurry of sax, flute, clarinet, trumpet, and drums. But it's not an aggressive, cacophonous mix, instead sounding like swarms of (happy) birds. The percussion is light and dances, teasing, so the other musicians can respond. It's recorded live on the radio and therefore has a someone amateurish production - the low end is non-existent, though maybe it's just the pressing. Daniel Carter plays here, probably quite young as it's 1972. Then, it gets funky - or maybe I should say 'choppy' - the guitar starts to provide some upstream and there's a bit of grittyness injected. Side two is more composed sounding but has the same fluidity. A bit of wah on the guitar and we're off. Jeanne Lee's voice is there, but not abundant. Good use of vibes, too. [21 October 2012]</p>

Kaiser's and West have a pretty good interplay - their rendition of Ayler's 'Ghosts' is spot-on - and the instrumental fuckery is pretty enjoyable. The vocalising by Michael Maksymenko on a few tracks is where I get lost - it takes on a boogie-soul vibe, and makes it hard to enjoy the musicianship which is otherwise excellent. It's a long session too, and I see why this ended up on SST cause it certainly is the kind of record I could see Greg Ginn grooving on. There's no anger whatsoever here; <i>Crazy Backwards Alphabet </i>doesn't have the sharp edge found on Massacre's first LP, for example.

It's definitely a partial joke - the liner notes are funny, with silly quotes from punk rock luminaries like Kent McClard and Sam McPheeters, lyrics written out in all of their ridiculous glory, and other miscellany.

The songs are pretty catchy and occasionally anarchic, and captures that 90s spirit pretty well. There's extended instrumentation - horns, strings, etc but mostly it feels like it was recorded live or in one take, so the rough edges are the charm. 'I Suck' is the hit, and certainly the song I most remember them for, but there's other gems: 'Ephedrine', 'Josh Has  Crush on a Femme from Reed' and 'Product', to name a few. The Dream of the 90s in Portland begins here - actually, this is so iconic of a brief movement in indie music that it's a worthwhile historic document if nothing else.

<p class="p1">Gastr del Sol's only EP for Drag City is a bite-sized dose of what made the O'Rourke and Grubbs combo great. There's a bit of the "Grubbs sings stupid stuff, plucks guitar + O'Rourke subtly alters it" sound they employed so well on <i>Crookt, Crackt or Fly</i>, and there's also a bit of  Don Cab/Fucking Champs-style guitar hysteria in 'Dictionary of Handwriting, with John McEntire's crisp indierock drumming (I love this track but don't care for other bands that sound like this, but I'm biased). The lengthy 'Eight Corners' is maybe the masterpiece, built around a seemingly endless hall of mirrors (which the title of this record also suggests, even though the track 'Mirror Repair' seems to be about organised labour) created by a solo piano. Various bits of insanity come and go, giving fleeting glimpses of complexity and pluralism. [5 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I really loved seeing Jorge play live and also enjoying playing with him in that surreal show we did together at Soodevahe. His recordings are likewise enjoyable, if you like thick, organic sound chunks built around strings. And I do! By opening with 'Inertia II', Core of the Coalman isn't fucking around - this staccato repetition would be best described as 'annoying' by the majority of listeners and I only like it for it's Steve Reich-esque tonal shifts, which are quite dramatic without being clichéd. The recording is quite dry which works well here, instead of being an easy reverb chamber. This pattern repeats as the much shorter 'Inertia I', which is maybe like a radio edit. It's an intense way to open a disc, which makes the second piece, 'Last Help', almost jarring when begins with a delicate guitar arpeggio. This uses a loop pedal for a similar repetitive sense as 'Inertia' but with a very different language. It recalls a lot of loop pedal guitar activities I've heard in recent years and thus isn't my preferred side of Jorge's music, but it's put together well and takes it's time to build steady overtones, resisting the urge to release.

<p class="p1">It's so weird when records you loved in high school start getting reissues in 20-year anniversary editions.  Although, this one is only 18 years old.  And holy shit, does it sound awesome to my ears today.  Perhaps that's cause I live in a state of perpetual nostalgia, or maybe it's cause the label (my edition is on Fire) did a great remaster job.  Blue vinyl too .... the memorable hits are still as memorable - 'Web in Front' and 'Wrong' are certainly classics of the genre - but some of my fave Archers tunes are songs like 'Might' and especially 'You and Me'.  The bonus material is "digital only" which is a big 'who cares' for me, but yeah, really really glad to have this.  Price, like everything in this order, has extra costs factored in for shipping to Estonia.

<p class="p1">After <i>Rough Frame</i> I was salivating for more Art Museums - even if it's not the most serious band, that album was probably my favourite record of 2010; it ticked all the right boxes with me. This single is more of the same formula, and 'Dancing With a Hole in Your Heart', in your bedroom, is clearly mined from the same post-adolescent headspace as so many of the great songs on the LP. But just by the nature of being a single, I don't have quite the same love of this, maybe because I rarely listen to it. All three songs are great though, and if we ever hear any more from this band it'll be a great day indeed. [21 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">The perhaps inaccurately-named Mountain Man are a trio of three female vocalists who perform original folk songs in the Americana vein, either a-capella or accompanied by the most minimal of acoustic guitar. I fell in love with this record because it stands out against all of the neo-folk things I usually hear, being based around simple cadences, incredibly evocative lyrics, and a stripped-down feel that understands it's space. As compared to the 10", the songs here are bathed in natural reverb, as I imagine this being recorded inside a large barn with just two really good microphones. The harmonies are pure ear candy, but it's more than just beautiful - they shift throughout parts of the same song, often creating the effect you'd get from medieval music ('Babylon', with biblical lyrics, could have been musically created in the 1400s). The overall effect still feels simplistic, but it's actually hiding much more complexity. Some of the lyrics have wedged themselves into my head by now, and there's a couple of incredible, incredible tunes. Plus the lone cover, 'How Am I Doing', is just stunning. I can't wait for their next release. [5 Aug 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Fuck, this first Tindersticks album ended up costing a lot with the shipping and everything. It is a beautiful double vinyl gatefold reissue, and I guess this is the reality of how much records cost now. The Tindersticks reputation rests mostly on these first two albums, which take an emotional, dramatic twist on British indie music, with something maudlin and theatrical added. The second album has more of the dour Gothic moods, while this one has some great jangly guitar-pop, such as 'Blood' or 'Patchwork'. Some really powerful stuff here, like 'Tie-Dye' - Tindersticks are masters of slowing things down just enough to let Staples' voice hang in the air, and an organ or string line to give it some extra gravitas. Other songs are so simple you can imagine them rehearsing in a garage, influenced by the <i>C86 </i>comp and naively picking out some guitar arpeggios - 'Piano Song' is so simplistic that you don't notice there isn't even any piano in it.

<p class="p1">Tindersticks' second album is the first one I heard, back in college, and I've had the CD for years. But who can pass up a luxurious vinyl reissue? This doesn't have a gatefold cover but nice, thick wax and by having so few songs per side (only 3 or 4) it actually feels like an even more monumental achievement than it actually is. There's so many classics here, all occupying this bizarrely British/Euro romanticism. Heavy handed? Yeah, 'My Sister' may seem that way, and the theatrical nature of these songs is laid on thick, far thicker than the first album, but can one deny the power of 'Cherry Blossoms'? The duets with the female vocalist are really lovely - 'Traveling Light' is not a million miles from boozy Mekons melancholia from the mid-80s - and the strings are played with the perfect mix of vibrato and drama. (Why are strings always 'arranged' and not just played?) [24 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: £3.91</p>
<p class="p1">How do I begin to talk about my relationship to His Name is Alive? Certainly they rank in my 5 favourite artists ever, if you held a gun to my head, but luckily the world of art and media is rich enough that no one has to make these choices. I first fell in love with them in 1998 when I moved out of my parents' house into Pittsburgh infamous punk rock house, the Peach Pitt, for just a few weeks (just housesitting for a friend and future roommate). One of my roommates, John C. Huha, was for some reason a huge HNIA fan and would listen to <i>Stars on ESP</i> a lot when he was in the (filthy, disgusting) kitchen cooking his vegan food. I remember coming down one day on my way to work at the public library and hearing the gospel ending of that album and asked him <i>"What the hell is this?"</i>. "His Name is Alive, dude!" and he ejected the tape and tossed it at me. I put it in my Walkman, walked to work, and by the time I arrived 15 minutes later I was a changed man. As I subsequently investigated the career of Warn Defever I became more and more fascinated by his approach to music, which skirted over genres, was intensely personal, and actually built a mythology. As he fell from favour with the 4AD crowd, I've stuck with him, within reason. After <i>Stars on ESP</i> came the might <i>Ft. Lake</i>, and together those are my two favourite releases, but then he went R&amp;B which I didn't like at the time (but now do) and then back towards pop and here, with <i>Detrola</i>, somewhat towards a more electo-dance type of pop. I've grown to like this record lots, and it's actually the last one I have (though I've heard and enjoy <i>Xmmer</i>) and think it's just the next logical step if you understand this man's strange musical progress. Which harkens back to <i>Livonia</i>'s Cocteau clouds and through the Beach Boys obsession, through the solo <i>I Want To Live for 100 Years</i> Americana-trip, through the R&amp;B and then back to some amalgamation of it all. There's always been something extremely sentimental in Warn's work, ever since day 1, but songs like 'Mama, Don't You Think I Know' feel extra packed with his own life story.  'Summer Left Your Heart Behind' is as perfect as anything on <i>Stars on ESP</i> or <i>Last Night</i>; and this may sound crazy but I feel a real Billy Joel influence on this record. And then 'I'll Send My Face To Your Funeral' comes along, with Warn harmonizing, and it's like we're back in the <i>I Want to Live 100 Years </i>smoke and magic. I guess I'm just hooked my Mr. Defever, deeply in my core. How else can I explain why I am still listening constantly to 'I Can't Live at Home In This World Anymore' 14 years later?

<p class="p1">I went on a mild John Davis kick last year and eBayed this, which I actually bought on CD in my high school days (during the Folk Implosion time, of couse) and then sold in disgust at the time. I didn't know how to handle his fey, minimalist/impressionistic songwriting and I didn't find anything to click with until his masterful <i>Blue Mountains</i> came out in '97. But on a revisit, <i>Leave Home</i> is almost as great. It's almost too easy to call this minimal or sketch-based, and not completely fair because that suggests that his songs are unfinished or sloppy. Davis is certainly not a polished musician or songwriter, but as an artist he nails something - a feeling of awe, a complicated innocence, and something actually primal, to employ and overused rock-cliché. A lot of these songs are based around a guitar riff or drum part that seems to be pulled from the essence of great rock anthems - like distilling the feeling of rock impulse into just one repetitive thrust -- but then without being cerebral about it. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me, even if it took me 15 years to figure that out. [20 November 2012]</p>

'For the 5th Time in 4 Years' is a sound collage built from radio signals, and it's a beautiful turning point in the middle of the record.

<p class="p1">I know this Amon Düül II record less than <i>Phallus Dei </i>or <i>Dance of the Lemmings</i> or even <i>Wolf City</i> just because I never had a copy until recently. It's remarkably consistent, never getting tiresome over two LPs, including the last LP being mostly a big long jam. The first LP is basically a great classic rock album, with awesome guitar riffs and hooks, and even that song with the robot voice, I think 'Eye-Shaking King' is completely epic. The third side extends from the end of the second and bleeds into the fourth, being the aforementioned jam. As jams go, it sounds quite composed actually - it's stays in rock territory, leaving the super free territory for other Kraut explorers. I dig the presence of female vocals - on 'Sandoz in the Rain' and 'Archangel Thunderbird' especially. There's a mood that is completely apocalyptic here - <i>Lemmings</i> comes off as relatively restrained and mature - and this dark magic is what makes this possibly their masterpiece.

For whatever reason, they're a band that I never listened to but never had any feelings for, or against. They were just a neutral entity. After listening to their first and allegedly best album a lot, and then purchasing this, allegedly their second best, I can say that I "like" Throwing Muses, but I feel no real passion for them. I've listened to this album 3 or 4 times but nothing jumps out at me, yet it's all sort of excellent in a mediocre way, if that makes any sense. The songwriting is actually pretty great and not like anything I can easily compare it to, yet I know I'll never have the time or investment to really get super into it. The sound of this band - the acoustic strum with 80s indie rock rhythms, and smart, edgy female vocals - is pretty awesome and I can totally understand the appeal. [26 July 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I'm a Rip, Rig and Panic fan, always preferring them to the Pop Group or other funky-dance punk experimentalists of the era. I'm not much of a dance type myself but when I do want to feel rhythms take over, I like it when it's built on top of extreme chaos, a dayglo panopticon of musical images, and enough jazz influence (my god, the piano playing!) to create unique flavours. This might be their best record, a double EP at 45rpm so it sounds loud and bassy, just like <i>Metal Box</i> isn't for me (since I only have it as <i>Second Edition, </i>33 1/3 rpm). There's some singles on here like 'Storm the Reality Asylum', a totally good tune, but the more exuberant explorations are really where it sings. 'Take a Don Key to Mystery'  features Uncle Don Cherry , and his presence is always welcome. His voice and trumpet playing make me think of where I left off with him - the time of <i>Brown Rice</i>, 7 years earlier - and how Rip, Rig and Panic is the next logical choice for him. That track takes the chaos of the 1980s and brings his philosophy to it, and it's a happy merger, with the hands in the cookie jars as they say. The few slower and more somber tracks, such as 'Subversive Wisdom', are also very welcome -- they prevent the record from becoming a massive blur. I've purchased so few records from Helsinki record stores but this was a very very nice find. [19 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I think <i>Flubber</i> is my fave Souled Am album, and one that took me a surprisingly long time to find on eBay.  This is a nice clean edition on Rough Trade UK and it sounds great.  Side one of this record is such a tour de force; the movement from the slow 'Wind to Dry' into the amazing 'Drop in the Basket' is a powerful effect.  Actually the latter tune is probably my favourite Souled American song, as it's so deconstructed and experimental while still maintain it's evocative, dry pain.  I can't really say I've ever heard a track that is quite in the same genre of "experimental country" except for maybe Henry Flynt, but Souled Am mine a different side of their avant tendencies, sounding a bit like Beefheart crossed with the VU's 'Murder Mystery' crossed with Hank Williams.  And the Beefheartisms are a natural fit for that punchy Bass VI sound.  On the flipside are more awesomes songs, especially 'Over the Hill' which practically melts under its own fragility.  I just need <i>Sonny</i> now to complete the quartet.

<p class="p1">Jon Collin's Winebox releases are so insanely beautiful, being made out of hand-carved wood, and this is no exception. The Vampire Blues recordings on here, live in Glasgow and Edinburgh, are really different than the deep blues-psych they did in Tallinn. Side 1 begins quietly, with some hazy drone and quiet plinking sounds that gradually ascends but then sets the weight back down instead of lifting off. Plucked acoustic strings, scrapings, and other halfhearted measures are backed by a thickening harmonium part, and it feels intensely casual. Incredibly fidelity too, for a live recording and a cassette.The B-sides begins with Collin's noodly, evocative electric guitar and the tone is fantastic. It floats slowly around a searing, hovering centre that slowly oscillates towards disorder. But it's an inviting, supportive disorder with rich waves of harmonium and wah-wah. [20 August 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">A friend of mine became slightly obsessed with this record, saying it grabbed him by surprise and was the most charming and wonderful thing he had heard in a long time.  I bit, and while it's definitely charming and fun, it never sunk it's teeth into me. This is self-consciously amateurish, overly juvenile (done with a wink and a nod yet with real honesty at the same time) and feels really of an era of rock music I was checking out from '07-'09, when I was looking to Terminal Boredom for recommendations of new artists. But the Beets lack the bile of a lot of other bands from that time and create a few musical images that are really wonderful. The slightly too-slow, 4/4, low-mixed vocal approach is monotonous but that's precisely the point; when they occasionally conjure a country twang (such as on  'I Wish I Knew') or a penetrating pop hook, I start to see why he loved this so much.

They're both amazing, but the weird thing about this one is that I grew to know it from a dub someone made me back when I worked at the Carnegie Library (circa 1997 or so) and they dubbed it with Side 2 starting things off, so to me , 'Famous' is the opening cut. But lo and behold, I finally get a proper copy of the record and discover that the album begins with 'With Whom To Dance', which seems crazy, perverse even! Whichever order it's in, it's great and timeless etc etc but it's kinda funny to recontextualise something that I thought I knew intimately. [13 July 2012]</p>

I'd like to come and comfort you, but I'd be blinded by the blue. Just make believe we're still in love. We come, unnoticed, at sundown - at the start of a blackout, we set bonfires all over town, and it's over by morning. But the straw that broke the camel's back was you. Time, measured in yellow dotted lines has passed you by. Now I have been closing all the shutters in the house; well, I know you'll be back when every tree is turning brown. You'll find the house is empty and the swingset's fallen down. So I stay so long in a place and then move on to the next town. Fifteen years of loving this album....

<p class="p1">I've always wanted this freaky aberration, a Catholic mass of sorts by Spooky Tooth (who I've never particularly cared for) with Pierre Henry as special guest. There's some slow, organ-led songs with wailing vocals, not overly religious (in general this is less churchy than the Electric Prunes mass LP) and a great vibe. But it's really what Henry adds that makes this so great. There's tape manipulations throughout, sometimes just low gurgling that sounds pre-digital skipping; sometimes more overt fuckery. The coda to the second track is awesome - completely whacked out vocal repetitions, with a juxtaposition of this over a moody, emotional rock song. The folky, heavily dramatic 'Our Father' prayer is actually pretty cool too, cause of Henry's sweeping ghost sounds overtop. By the end it starts to drag up some Catholic dust that I was hoping to repress, so I have to take this off (and maybe throw on my Venom record instead). How appropriate is it, that I bought this in super-Catholic Poland? You are what you are, and I'm flashing back to Sister Roseanne's 5th grade religion class here. [8 October 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">This is the last Van Morrison record I'm familiar with, but I love it. It's much more on the folk-soul tip than the rock-soul, and there's a loose, airy feel to most of it. The really elegant, flowing tracks like 'Linden Arden Stole the Highlights' and 'Country Fair' are amazing; the more romantic ones have their charm as well. When he gets the swing on, like 'Streets of Arklow', there something undeniabe in the groove. With more listening time dedicated it could probably emerge on the same level as <i>Astral</i> or definitely <i>St. Dominic's Preview</i>. Bonus points for the bizarre cover. Where next?

There are some tiny, searing resonating tones in the distances of the more ambient tracks which are as graceful as my favourite Stars of the Lid tracks; the only real criticism I have is that there isn't very much apocalypse to hear.

I always thought this record was just a novelty, and it was too funny and far out to really enjoy. But time weathers attitudes and when I saw a nice vinyl reissue (with a bonus CD version) I had to grab it. This week in Poland, John and I had a blast listening to "the song" over and over. Because while there's some decent enough prog-jam explorations here, it's really the endless orgasmic loop/chant/freakout that defines <i>Cottonwoodhill</i>. It really became an inside joke between us, and we've even proposed setting up events around this album. "The song", which is actually called 'Brainticket', is split over both sides and I'm glad to hear it in 180gram goodness.

<p class="p1">I've never ventured into 1980's Roy Harper but know it to be a hit and miss venture. This is supposedly one of the hits, the album of demo versions of songs that later got overly produced for <i>Work of Heart</i>. The more stripped-down demos are still very produced for my tastes - rich, ringing electric guitar strums, percussion in the background, and multi-tracked vocals with lots of reverb (or some sort of effect). The songwriting is pretty OK though. 'No Woman is Safe' is a masterfully dark tune, and the long suite of songs making up 'Work of Heart' is not unlike 'McGoohan's Blues' and other great Harper songs of the past. I probably won't pull this out much, because as much as I like the minimal Harper guitar/voice combination, the clangy sound of the guitar and the similarity of the arrangements starts to grate on me after awhile, not really showcasing the elegant songwriting tricks I like about him (such as when things slow down and get more spacious). But still, not a bad find and the songs could certainly grow on me with further study. [19 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Thanks David and Heather! Here's one more to cross of my list of 'repress dreams'. Higney's record is legendary for being fucked-up, off-key, and desolate. Well, yeah. Higney recorded these with him singing as demos, basically, and sent this around to demonstrate his songwriting talents. It was never re-recorded, thank god, and thus we are left with gems like 'Cant Love That Woman' and 'Children of Sound', built around go-nowhere guitar strums and one-measure adrenaline rushes. Like all great painful records, <i>Attic Demonstration</i> is tortured but masquerades the misery behind attempted universalising; more commercial stabs, got entirely wrong, and of course the amateur psychedelic production techniques help. On the more rockin' songs, Kenneth sometimes get this manic edge to his voice; the slower ones all sort of sound the same, but I like to think of it as one long piece with many movements. The reissue sounds as good as possible, and comes with liner notes written by Mr. Higney himself who sounds fairly well-adjusted these days. [26 December 2012]</p>

A rehearsal it really is - there are starts and stops, retakes, the sounds of dogs barking in the distance, tuning up, etc. There's a lyric sheet presented which is laid out nicely, and allows one to follow the wordy 'Henry, Where is Lyon?'. This is a story, unfolding over a long repetitive chord progression, and I wish a studio version of this existed because it's an incredible song.

<p class="p1">I've passed on this LP for years and years, but when I found it here in Tallinn I figured 'what the hell'. This is a big departure from the first EP and album, with Steve Wynn taking command in a much more Americana/Neil Young style. There's some good rock and roll for sure - 'Bullet with My Name On It' has a brilliantly precise Crazy Horse rhythm section, but some of the lyrics are too clich?d and lame, and there's not enough Karl Precoda except on 'John Coltrane Stereo Blues', the album standout, which makes side 2 a much more fun trip. Kendra Smith left before this and I would have never thought she made so much of a difference, particularly as the replacement bassist has such a similar style (as the title track indicated) but, yeah, it's just lacking something though not bad at all.

<p class="p1">Aspec(t) played a show here in April with a filmmaker called 70fps in the band, who accentuated their electroacoustic improv with sound generated from 16mm film loops. This LP doesn't feature him, but it's all there is on vinyl so I'll take it. I was blown away by Aspec(t) live because they illustrated the joy that can come from working with reel-to-reels, old analogue equipment, and acoustic things as well -- I was reminded of the rush I felt from the earliest Lied Music sessions with Luke, except they're a million times better than we ever were. The record, which I assume is drawn from improvised sessions, mixes between extremely intricate, delicate interactions and spazzy noise bursts. The more restrained side wasn't present in the live show, and fair enough - the energy they had was honestly something I've rarely ever seen before in this type of music. So having something on vinyl for more 'deep listening' is nice, although the visual element of the live experience was a big part of what I enjoyed (something else I can't say too often). I realise that this is supposed to be about the record and I keep talking about how great the live show was, without saying anything about the record, but when listening, it's really the only thing that I can think about.

That doesn't mean the sounds aren't diverse and lively, though, as there's a nonstop momentum from the moment the stylus hits the vinyl. Little jittery sound clicks and more layered drones make this sound, from my words, like a lot of other things, but there's something bonkers about his approach. As insanely processed as this is - some of these edits are impossible to do without a computer, and I'm sure the whole thing is digitally assembled - it doesn't feel like your typical electronica/experimental creation. Maybe it's the inherent woodyness of these sounds - even when they are synthesized, they recall some old, distant memory. Great popping sounds on side 2 also; one of my fave pickups this year.

Others have distinctly digital processing, almost comically so, yet somehow it mixes well. It's 45rpm on red vinyl but it doesn't feel short; there's enough ideas sketched out here to be as satisfying as a full album.

I love the Nocht the Only Ghouls record which is extremely odd and hard to situate. Daywand is a little more together, and much thicker in orchestration. It feels a bit like something from the Not Not Fun or Shdwply labels - mostly instrumental jams, dirty in production, with weird, often conflicting layers. There's programmed drums, keyboards, and electronic noise ('Drip Daze' sounds like it has that cheapo sampler I used to have where you rubbed your finger to 'scratch') but some guitar playing as well, occasionally very delicately placed (though it sounds like they might try carefully to make this sound messy) . The singing is slow and mixed in quite well; I wonder what possible influences there are. The band name makes me want to sing it to the tune of the 'Dayman' song from <i>It's Always Sunny</i> but there's not really much resemblance musically. This music is largely the work of one person and it's an interesting window into what kinds of things happen in Kutztown, PA, and American underground music in general in 2012.

This isn't even a different recording, just a better mastering job and I must admit, it sounds great - a lot is going on between the dissonant shimmer and alien clanging that makes up the track. Things often sound better in mono, though. The latest recording on here is ''?Death 3' from 1975, but most recordings are from the 60's.

<p class="p1">Egg, Eggs is a messy noise-rock band made up of some Western Mass luminaries - I recognise John Moloney from Sunburned in the lineup, as well as the guy that runs Feeding Tube. There's a lot of guitars, strained and distorted vocals, long jammy electronic bits, and just plain fucking around. The legacy of bands like Starship Beer is kept alive here, though I doubt it's an intentional influence - the wacked out singing, often several voices at once, lends an absurdity to the whole thing. As much as I want to listen deeply and really find the brilliant ideas in <i>The Cleansing Power of Fruit</i>, I end up getting distracted easily and tuning it out - and it sounds to me like the band was also in this state.

<p class="p1">This Shep and Me release is a bit bouncier than the other one - with a country-friend voice at times, some very nice banjo playing, and a jaunty rhythm throughout most. There's some more mellow moments, and a beautiful instrumental in the middle of side one. This was originally released as a cassette in 2007 so it's earlier than the other LP, and definitely recalls something a bit caricatured about Americana. I l like it anyway. [25 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Cost: $18</p>
<p class="p1">So psyched to find this, which discogs.com credits to V-3 though I've always thought of it as a Jim Shepard solo album. There are all sorts of weird experiments at play here, but somehow it manages to be really direct despite being so indulgent. Maybe Mayo Thompson's <i>Corky's Debt</i> album is a good comparison, as that's simultaneously his most "accessible" and "weird" work at the same time. I don't know Shepard's catalogue as deep as I do Thompsons, but Evil Love Deeper has moments that resemble the bitter garage punk of <i>Photograph Burns</i> while also having moments of aborted tape experiments, electroacoustic dirges, and collages, just like the Vertical Slit LP I have. There's a spoken reminiscing about the Vertical Slit days - 'when we were 17 and we could barely tune our guitars' becomes his 'Me and Mike Watt just playing guitar', except it seems infused with a sadness the Minutemen stuff only took on after Boon's death; Shepard had yet to die at this point but is clearly headed that way.

<p class="p1">It's nice to hear some more Axemen; <i>Big Cheap Motel </i>is great but not super representative. This double LP has lots more to offer and really spans a lot of different things. It's from '89 and it's not exactly genre-hopping, but it goes into a lot of different territory. 'Shacked Up in Yr Egypt Tomb' is so Royal Trux-like I thought it was a cover. 'The Virgin' I think is a Kim Fowley song or something, cause I've definitely heard it before. There is snarled, Crass-style punk songs, detuned tracks that sound like early Tuxedomoon, and a streak of irreverence throughout everything. It's diversity is its strength. Siltbreeze can keep these coming, cause I'm even more happy with this than the first one. [11 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">During Shadwply's brief run of being a label that I was interested in, this was pretty much the pinnacle of it. Actually I don't know what this label is doing but it's probably still releasing interesting music. Gary War's record is built around home-recorded rock/pop songs layered with cheap effects and whatever other tools were available to the home-psychedelicist in the mid-00s. This means a lot of lo-fi hiss, flanger, and phase effects as well as simple rhythm/drum tracks and chorus pedal galore. Some songs resemble Ariel Pink ('Healthy Living', in particular) who must be now be perceived as the leader of this sound, but Gary War has a more weird, distant atmosphere on his better tracks. The melting, elliptical 'Cyclops Eye' is a highlight as well as the album closer, 'Edge of Mess'. [19 December 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">I was really taken by this band back in 2008 and scooped up everything  I could find; somehow I missed this second album, which is really a collection of outtakes. But there's some great stuff here, though nothing as powerful as the hits from <i>Cheveu. </i>The space-rock bits are a new direction, as it's impressive what these guys can do with rudimentary equipment in (presumably) their bedrooms. Overall this is somewhat more exploratory; there is weird underwater gurgling on 'PsyX', bursts of treated synth noise on 'Sacha', and much less focus on fast, punk-styled song structures. It's a different listening mode and a step towards the beautiful <i>1000</i>, but not one that I will remember to play frequently. [25 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">How delightful to see this issued on vinyl! Over 5 sides, the entirety of Moss Icon's brief, unheralded existence is presented, with minimal liner notes (partial lyrics and credits). Moss Icon were pretty interesting - their most obvious influence is probably Saccharine Trust, though without the jazz influence, except for parts of the second record ('Moth' and 'Memorial' in particular, where vocalist Jonathan Vance leaves the gruff post-hardcore voice behind entirely and we even get some acoustic guitar, strumming 7th chords). The first disc is their full-length album, a classic of transitional post-hardcore: punchy riffs, changing tempos, and that shitty late 80's solid-state production. Moss Icon's greatness lies in the conflict between Tonie Joy's guitar playing and Vance's bizarre stream-of-consciousness lyrics, the likes of which had never been seen in the punk rock world before. Drenched in equal parts Castaneda and collegiate philosophising, this acid-burned approach to punk was developed much further by the Gravity Records roster a few years later (a label which possibly took its name from a Moss Icon song?). Musically, it's smart; on 'Lyburnum Wit's End Liberation Fly' there's even a change-up that could be lifted straight from an R.E.M. record. I guess this is seen as early 'emo' now, or mid-period depending on where you draw the lines. [8 November 2012]</p>

<p class="p1">Mike put out this record for Shep and Me, some sort of new outcast/weirdo artist who was based in Pittsburgh for a bit. These songs are distraught, desperate and distant; built around an acoustic ambience that is imprecise and wistful. Jandek's an obvious comparison but it's a lot less abrasive; the vocals are high-pitched and there's a sense of drifting that passes through it all. When necessary the oddball recording techniques add to the vibe; I suspect this is best experienced in totality rather than partially. I bought two by him cause I liked what I heard.

<p class="p1">Patrick's new double CD is a mammoth exploration of field recording, editing, and resonance. The opening cut sounds like a tribute to the first cut of the Dead C's <i>Tusk</i>, with this rattling sound repeatedly appearing and disappearing, but I know he's never heard that, so here it's becomes a uniquely unfolding exploration of contrasts. 'Framework 2' has some subtle soft drones in the background but it never allows one to be too comfortable. Patrick is really meticulous in choosing which serendipities to accentuate; there are buzzings, wind, and rustling but they are left <i>in situ</i>, only to be showcased by adjusting what is around them. It descends into some French speaking and then throat-clearing or snoring or something of the sort. Very odd, and I like that. Disc two beings with 'Framework 3 [Swam]', which goes for 33 minute and the swarm is a warm, metallic resonance that moves nicely across the stereo field, with some friends of mine harmonising on minor intervals. Here's a case of duration adding to a work - because it can take its time, the environment takes over and humanity is pushed to the periphery; the sounds of civilisation are present, but equal to the treated layer that is the 'swarm' of the title. And then finally (after another lovely interlude), 'Framework 4 [Spaces]', which is pure acoustic space. There are creakings in the background over what sounds like Maryanne Amacher's non-inner ear work, and then an overwhelmingly up-front outdoor cricket symphony takes over - to compare this to yet another recording, Dwight Frissell's <i>Natural Selection</i>. I think one of the reasons I will compare this so many other things is because I know Patrick is reading this. It's lovely as well and then the epilogue comes, 'Irrigation Drain' which is just that - what I always cite when I want to make fun of sound art, but it is beautiful to listen to. Patrick also explains his motivations and techniques in liner notes which are honest, direct, and informative without destroying any mystery. I'm impressed at how well this is put together as a complete package - maybe this is his theatre/clown past at work, where the sense of a 'show' is evident -- something Ville remarked to me after his Kodu Baar gig last May.
