William Gaddis<br/ >
Source: Book Country<br/ >
Cost: $0<br/ >
It's sad, finishing this book; besides the fact that it was incredibly dark and it made me want to put a gun to my mouth, it's also the last Gaddis novel that I haven't already read, which means I need to re-read them or wait until his posthumous novel is published this fall.  That said it was probably the most depressing of his works, not even very funny save for a few extended rants against religion.  This shorter work is probably his most conventional book but it also just wasn't that interesting;  he was wise to end it after 264 pages because the narrative wouldn't have sustained for very much longer.  The story is really about the darkness of man and the modern age, as almost all of the characters are completely unlikeable.  It's not one i'll read again any time soon.<br /><br />

Another great Elkin. This time he's really revealing a lot of himself, as the main character's paranoia goes is incredibly human, fragile, and surprisingly warm.  Plus there's a minor mystery in the plot which is nice but not overdone.  And it's funny too, though not as sweeping in it's humour as some of the other ones I've read.  Another great slice of Americana, this time focusing on city life in a realistic yet "Elkin" way.<br /><br />

This was the book that Elkin considered to be his finest; I can certainly see how it's his most accomplished, as the emotional parts really hint at the desperation in his characters.  Additionally, the narrative structure is complex without being confusing, a real testament to Elkin's ability to pull the reader through a story.  However, I never really identified with George Mills, and the historical glimpses into Mills'  ancestry, while sorta the point of the book, weren't really that enjoyable.  And overall, it just wasn't FUNNY.  I still thought it was great because Elkin is such a talented writer, but I would never recommend this as a starting point.<br /><br />

Finally finished; and I am left pretty much speechless by this amazing masterpiece.  McElroy's record of perception is stunning; narrator Cartwright tries to manage all of the interpersonal connections in his head, and likewise you do too; but the constant shifts in time and space make it extremely difficult to follow, and we are left with the feeling that it will all fit together neatly like a detective story if we can only figure it out ourselves.  But I couldn't; the last sixty pages were completely overwhelming, dizzying, sinister, yet compelling.  This novel succeeds so much because it combines McElroy's stylistic genius with an actual plot, and a damn good one at that.  Cartwright is one of the greatest characters of contemporary/pomo literature, and it's a fucking crime that this book is out of print and hideously obscure.<br /><br />

It's great to have a new Bill Bryson book to devour, even if it's not as funny as his others.  It's a real "popular science" type of book, but his talent at making things interesting is unsurpassed.  The writings on natural history, specifically volcanos, were the best - there's a little bit of humour here and there, but mostly a genuine commitment to explanation.  It fascinates me how little we actually know about the world - i guess i had assumed that science was pretty much wrapping things up. It puts a lot of things in perspective.<br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
Very fun (and reading 860 pages in 2 days is great work); structurally almost identical to book #4, but much darker.  It's interesting to see how she has incorporated basic political ideas into it, as the book touches on not only bureaucracy but media control and, I guess, terrorism.  Maybe i'm crazy to detect a post-9/11 feel to this Harry Potter book but it's definitely not all wine and roses.  Also I liked how Harry and Sirius were both becoming self-involved prats, and not just total heroes.  Even though Harry makes a mistake in every book, he really makes a mistake in this one.  There weren't really any surprises to the story though, and I didn't put the book down thinking "Holy fuck, shit is totally fucked up!" like i did after #4.<br /><br />

Very fun, light comic novel about a man who is lost in his own world.  It says a lot about imagination, faith, and religion as the awesome last chapter takes a diversion.  Additionally it was all about baseball which was fun; it made me really wonder how much worse Waugh was than the rest of us because although he is obsessive about a phony baseball league, we are often obsessive about equally superficial things.<br /><br />

By the end of this I was sorta like "what the fuck?"  I didn't really understand how the narrative was constructed and what he was going for - it had that exaggerated, extremist attitude that French intellectuals always have and while some parts were definitely funny, other parts seemed a bit too dogmatic and they rather pissed me off.  The ending was quite stupid, though many may feel it's the strong part of the book, I just saw it as a cop-out and any sort of existential philosophy built up by the other parts seemed irrelevant.  I certainly understand why Houellebecq is controversial - because in France, people actually read literature and give a shit about this stuff, which must be nice.<br /><br />

The stories I liked the most were the funniest ones; the ones I liked the second most were just weird; overall I think I liked the earlier, funnier stuff better (just like Woody Allen!) but overall I really enjoyed this - it was great bus reading, as I could just read one or two stories each day.  The detached, faux-profound writing just strikes me as hilarious, though he may be trying to actually go for something artistic at time; I really do like Barthelme though and I want to check out the nonfiction stuff Adam was telling me about.<br /><br />

Hilarious quest novel that mixed the American-style humour of Gaddis with the all-out wackyness of Flann O'Brien.

This was way better than Masters of Atlantis and more obviously funny - and I would recommend this to anyone.  I loved it!<br /><br />

Joseph McElroy<br/ >
Source: CLP<br/ >
Cost: $0<br/ >
Writing about this isn't going to be easy; like the other McElroy books I've read it defies explanation, for the plot is relatively irrelevant.  This has a phenomenal literary consciousness to it, though at times it because so tough (in the unique difficult way of McElroy) that I wanted to put it down; still, I pushed my way through it and discovered a novel rich with connections, taking a semi-mundane encounter and extrapolating all of the connections between the characters.  Daley is such a difficult and obtuse character; even while floating inside his thoughts and memories for 400 pages I didn't really understand him.  Still, the connections he makes often take a paranoid tone, reflecting the sinister vision of Lookout Cartridge at times.  I don't know if I would even recommend this book to someone else.  Every word seems so important, and the choppy style really mirrors thoughts well.  McElroy is such an incredible literary experience, but you really have to want to read him, and I'm not sure why I pushed myself into his ouvre so much but I'm glad I did.  <br /><br />

This book was surreal to read because it felt like a book I have tried to write multiple times; the first section about the thief echoed an aborted short story from a couple of years ago; the overall flow of the book was exactly like my first novel; and the second part is about an electroacoustic composer, which just seems like something I would write. What I really loved about this book was the way that the book was populated with mundane household objects that kept reappearing, suggesting some spooky connections between the characters - a great idea, but I wish the book was 800 pages longer to really develop this and link more characters together.  It could be an American "Life: A User's Manual" that way; not that Loewinsohn should strive to emulate other works, but it would really be an accomplishment.<br /><br />

Stanley Elkin<br/ >

Elkin's first novel is more or less a blueprint for what is to follow: hilariously exaggerated protagonists with loud personalities, the tendency to break into monologues, and a sad, fragile side that exposes their weaknesses.  This started slow but once it got rolling it had some very funny scenes, and is an interested look at celebrity in the early 1960's.  Boswell's feelings about death are the specter that hangs over the novel, and shades of this are definitely evident in later works like the Franchiser and the Magic Kingdom. <br /><br />

This is a fantastic story about a child genius, perhaps caught up a bit in it's own erudition but never getting too ambitious in it's own prose.  DeWitt weaves together so many references to science, classics, etc. that it reminds me at times of David Markson's "Wittgenstein's Mistress", especially in it's first person address.  The beginning of the book is incredibly delightful and fun; once the son takes over the narrative and begins searching for a father figure it falls into a routine that takes away from the excitement of the book, though it's still quite excellent reading.<br /><br />

A longer Charles Portis novel, this one followed the adventures of Jimmy Burns, a lackadaisacal American who lives in Merida, Mexico.  Much like the protagonist of "The Dog of the South," Burns lives life his way but doesn't take any shit; however, he's not macho at all.  The construction of the characters is really what I like about Portis, and his eccentric characters are the spice that makes the book keep going. <br /><br />

Source: Jay's<br/ >
Cost: $15<br/ >
Lester's second collection of writings is every bit as great as the first.  He had a remarkable voice, but unlike Meltzer he never became too bogged down in his own negativity.  His unpublished essay on the death of Sid Vicious is a very intelligent look at punk that sadly has gone unheard.  His writings on music are great, and it's great to see his love for Charlie Haden and the Mekons, but his writings on culture offer a look at someone who lived during a vital time, was in the pulse of things, and never let himself be defined by any stupidity.  Of course most of these pieces are about music and culture, and the more wacked out stuff is totally hilarious.  The 8 million pieces about the Rolling Stones are almost as funny/obsessive as the 8 million pieces about Lou Reed in "Psychotic Reactions".  Of course, there are a few Lou Reed pieces here too.<br /><br />

Frederick Exley managed to summon sympathy from me with this autobiography, thinly disguised as fiction, and that's notable because he's a real asshole.  His candid honesty is certainly remarkable; he's in the mold of that sensitive tough guy, like Hemingway, macho as hell but not afraid to lay it out on paper.  I mostly felt like I was reading a book that Holden Caufield would have written had he grown up a bit and not changed at all, which was also depressing.  Halfway through I thought about how I never read autobiographies by people who have interesting, worthwhile lives, yet I was spending my time reading this.  Of course, interesting and worthwhile lives aren't always this entertaining.  <br /><br />

Three by Perec (Verba Mundi)<br/ >
Georges Perec<br/ >
Source: half.com<br/ >
Cost: $14<br/ >
I was psyched to find this for cheap on half.com.  This collects three shorter works into one volume, and I was most excited about "The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex" which is the English translation of "Les Revenetes", the corollary to "La Disparition".  "Which Moped etc." is an early novella, a very funny rendering of a slightly interesting narrative, though it certainly shows the marks of being "early".  "The Exeter Text" is a profound disappointment - while it's still impressive that e is the only vowel, a lot more liberties had to be taken with the language to make the story work.  Of course I accepted these modifications - I was disappointed because it's so damn hard to read that after 30 pages I had to stop.  It's certainly a novel idea (or novella idea, ha ha) but pushing through the actual text started to make me dizzy.  And reading on, I knew there wasn't going to be any payoff, for the best thing about the text was known before I even read it.  The final piece in this book, "A Gallery Portrait", is the most rewarding.  From 1982, it was his last published work, I believe, and continues in the manner that "La Vie Mode D'Emploi" began.  It reminded me of that great Steven Millhauser novella I read a few years ago, only with that Perec wit and a complexity to the artifice.  The idea of a huge painting of paintings of paintings (and so on recursively) with slight variations in each iteration is incredibly Perecian, and I'm glad he got his idea down before his untimely passing.<br /><br />

Cost: $6.39<br/ >
I can't believe I found this for only $5 on half.com!!!!&nbsp; McElroy continues to amaze me.&nbsp; Here is another novel that hijacks the concept of narrative, creating a crazy network of mental associations and memories.&nbsp; The &quot;plot&quot; is merely the narrator, Cy, hiding in the apartment of a famous celebrity writer/political figure just moments after his suicide.&nbsp; The book is being written as he hides there, and the &quot;space&quot; of the novel is entirely within Cy's head.&nbsp; His memories are very personal and they occasionally correlate to the celebrity's life, but the genius of this book (like all of McElroy's other novels except for maybe &quot;Lookout Cartridge&quot;) is not in the story, but in the style.&nbsp; As disorienting as his other works, I've become somewhat used to his prose after reading a few, so I get a good feel for this &quot;paraphase&quot; (as Cy calls it).&nbsp; There is a rich human side to McElroy's prose that draws largely from his personal experiences - and I'm sure that Cy is David Brooke is Cartwright is Daley is Jospeh McElroy himself.&nbsp; And I didn't have to pay upwards of $50 for this, though it usually fetches that price online.&nbsp; Now if only I can find &quot;Hind's Kidnap&quot;!<br /><br />

This book has been on my list for awhile as something that looked like a lot of fun, and it certainly was - a quick read that is over-the-top hilarious and very Barthelme-influenced.  Bachelder is a pretty good writer, and he paces it well so it never becomes boring (nor do the relentless metafictional aspects become tiresome).  Some parts were just completely hilarious, and this guy could be the next David Foster Wallace (he even makes several references to DFW in the text).  Plus, his name sounds like "Box Elder".<br /><br />

Read (slowly) on the bus, which is a pretty good way to take in three novellas. &quot;The Bailbondsman&quot; is not one of Elkin's strongest works, though it is very indiciative of his style - a somewhat crazed, overassertive protagonist that captures a weird cross-section of middle America. &quot;The Making of Ashenden&quot; begins as a parody of the rich and turns into a twisted tale of bestiality; I must admit it was pretty entertaining, though again not something I would recommend. It's only &quot;The Condominium&quot; that really stands as one of Elkin's better efforts. And unlike his other protagonists, this one is rather muted, only breaking into soliloquy once I think. While the ending seemed rather sudden, this was definitely the best of the three selections in this volume.<br /><br />

Second reading.  The first time I read this book, I thought it was hilarious, yet overambitious - nothing I would have considered a masterpiece, but definitely the funniest book I have ever read.  And after a second passage through the book's 1100 pages, I find it both a masterpiece and one of the saddest books I have ever read (though still probably the funniest).  How the inescapable sorrow of this book escaped my attention the first time I do not know; I guess I was caught up in the novel's quirks.  I will go as far as saying that this is the best and most accomplished book that I have ever read from within the past 20 years (not that there is a lot of competition).  I certainly love arcane, bizarre encyclopediac novels, but this is successful on so many levels.  DFW is undoubtedly a genius, the prose dazzling in both language and erudition.  The imagination that went into this novel is astounding, as is the organization.  While it seemed sprawling and inconclusive the first time through, it now reveals itself as a well-crafted book with many deliberate ambiguities.  I guess one of the things I liked the most about this book is the sense of mystery; lots is unexplained, and I can accept that there is no definite answer - yet it's still really fun to read, and look for clues, and try to put things together.  This sense of the reader as a detective is something that I really enjoy in film and literature, and something that I need to find more of.  I wish all of my friends would read this, so I can talk about it with them.  The narrative is "anti-confluential" itself, just like the films of James O Incandenza, and the book itself becomes an addiction, as I would crave it's pages when I wasn't reading - making the stories of addiction work.  I wish it was twice as long, three times even.  I wish there'd be a sequel.  12/12, five stars, amazing, use all the superlatives you like.  <br /><br />

What a disappointment!  After reading the summary on the Dalkey site I anxiously awaited this book - it sounded like an absurd, hilarious Oulipian novel.  Instead I read a tightly-focused political satire, that I guess was okay, but nothing remarkable.  The book ends on a bit of a non-sequitur, I think, and it certainly wasn't unpleasant reading - but I expected something more zany, given the story.  Jouet is an Oulipian but i don't know if this novel was constructed using Oulipo methods - I would guess not.<br /><br />

The Stones of Summer truly is a remarkable book, surprisingly powerful in it's use of language and metatextual elements.  I was worried that this would be a disappointment, after all of the hype, but I think Moskowitz really did unearth a treasure.  While the narrative at times just resembles an Iowan "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", the ending really unravels the narrative and calls into question all sorts of issues of unreliable narrators, autobiography, etc.  But beyond all that, Mossman just uses language in a remarkable way, with some of the most beautiful descriptions of nature and the Midwest that I have ever read.<br /><br />

Fathers and Crows. Seven Dreams. A book of North American landscapes<br/ >
William T. Vollmann<br/ >
Source: Caliban's<br/ >
Cost: $4.5<br/ >
As much as it's easy to get excited about &quot;Rising Up and Rising Down&quot;, Vollmann's Seven Dreams series will probably be even more impressive. This 800 page novel concerned the Jesuit attempts to convert the Huron in the seventeenth century, and was so incredibly well-researched that it could almost be taught as nonfiction. There were far less fictional flourishes than The Rifles, but it still managed to hold my interest. I was actually pretty amazed at how readable it was, considering how daunting and dry I thought it would be. And it's almost as well-documented as his non-fiction, filled with biographical sources, glossaries, and gazetteers. Vollmann's treatment of the Catholic missionaries was interesting - he did not seem to be judgements, actually casting one as a hero through his piousness. But I can't help but think this is Vollmann being a devil's advocate, as the whole book resonated with the atrocities committed by the French and British (though oddly, the Iroquois were really presented as the evil force in the book). <br /><br />

Wow!  This has sat on my shelf for years, and I'm glad I finally attacked it.  Coover is totally hilarious, and daring in how he skewers Nixon.  Oddly though, Nixon becomes pretty likeable as the protagonist.  As far as novels encompassing mid-20th century America, this is tops as far as satire goes.  Despite the hilarity within, deep down it felt like a quiet plea against the death penalty, and a strange warning about what America was to become.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />

It's nice to read some non-fiction; Solnit takes an interesting idea - the history of walking - and uses this to trace a path throughout art, social action and history.

Sections on mountain climbing and Las Vegas were especially interesting. A quick read but a nice break from the heavy fiction.<br /><br />

A brief, personal McElroy novel about a boy who's father died, and the father wrote him a letter, which is then copied among family and classmates.

I would recommend this as a starting point for his books because of it's length, though it doesn't have the interconnected mindfuck elements of Lookout Cartridge.  <br /><br />

Good; possibly more enjoyable than Wind-up Bird.  Murakami's style (or perhaps his translator) is so calm and detached, yet managed to evoke emapthy from me for the main character.

It's packed with cultural references and could almost be seen as a memoir of the early years of graffiti and hip-hop, and the last part is so crowded with music nerd references that it almost loses focus.  I spent the entire day reading this and went through almost 600 pages - it was definitely the "Can't put it down" type of book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, to everyone.<br /><br />

Revisiting this novel after five years really felt like I was reading it for the first time; I had forgotten much of the action/development.

I had low expectations, but wow, this was an incredible debut novel.  The postmodern structural crap worked really well, and pretty much made this great.  While mining the emotional territory of the Holocaust is easy material for heavy drama, this novel succeeds still, mostly because of it's juxtaposition with very sharp humour.  Gil may feel this was irresponsible because of the way it used a nonfictional town but I have no problem with it - this is fiction and if Coover and use Richard Nixon as a character, Foer is entitled to use a historical village (though it is on his conscience).

Terrible!  I usually don't read shitty thrillers like this, but I am drawn towards books with a Templar/secret Europe/Illuminati conspiracy side, which this reveled in.  The story goes so over the top that it's hard to take it seriously, and I kept comparing it to Foucault's Pendulum while I was reading it.  And here's an analogy - The DaVinci Code  is like a shitty American/Hollywood remake of a great European film (Eco's novel); it removes all ambiguity and makes things simple, so the reader/viewer doesn't have to think.  (And Lookout Cartridge is like if Alain Resnais made a conspiracy film, and maybe Illuminatus is like an absurdist/experimental version a la Robert Nelson - but my metaphor is getting carried away).  Conspiracy fiction is my favorite cup of tea, and this was a particularly poor example.  Sadly, I found myself continuing to read it, laughing out loud at how cheesy it was but secretly enjoying it - we all have guilty pleasures, eh?<br /><br />

Oh, Houllebecq.  I didn't care for Atomised yet I picked this up anyway, and found myself yet again disappointed.  Still, it was a quick read and had some incredibly funny comments towards the beginning - humour that is the most misogynistic and misanthropic I have ever read outside of conversations among my friends.  The bleak, existential attitude was boring - I read The Stranger when I was in high school, thank you.  The ending fell apart, though not as badly as his first novel - and the very last pages were so "oh woe is me, life is empty" laughable that I was doing just that - laughing.  Still the sex scenes were pretty hot and I suspect this is the major appeal of his work to most people.<br /><br />

I've never read Joseph Heller before (somehow I have never gotten around to Catch-22) but will have to read more- this was a crushingly honest depiction of the dark side of middle-class affluence.  The fears alluded to in this book are shared by all men, yet laid out in such a bare manner it took an incredible amount of guts from Heller.  The vulnerability exposed here is shocking, and the neurotic paranoia in here is funny in a very bleak way.<br /><br />

Essays about politics and development by a highly-acclaimed novelist.  I enjoyed this for the India and political content, though Roy has a real flair for drama that charges all of these essays with an emotional level that is somewhat unprofessional from political writing.  The anti-American rants are fairly standard and somewhat unnecessary (I've read a million condemnations of the War on Terror already and don't need anymore, thank you), but her essays exposing the dangers of development projects and dam-building across the Deccan were remarkable, and probably the most important justification for this book to exist.<br /><br />

I picked this up cause it was cheap, and because I like Stephen Fry as an actor/comedian; as a novelist he is nothing special, crafting a far-fetched revenge tale with echoes of The Prisoner.

I thought this was going to be a travelogue - and it was, but not a linear one necessarily - rather a series of essays about different places that followed a specific path.

Still, the travelling itself is half of the fun here - trains, plains, buses - and I had hoped that Fishlock would focus a bit on this.<br /><br />

Wes Anderson must be a huge John Irving fan - this novel is just begging for a film adaptation.  It has many of the same themes as Anderson's work, but most importantly a similar sense of whimsicality, seriousness and sentimentality blended together into a palatable package.  Like Garp this was fun, dealt with women's issues well, and had an annoying unnecessary epilogue that ties up every possible end of things.  Still, a good read though I don't think I will be reading anything else by Irving.<br /><br />

I read most of this while waiting for my room to be ready.  I used to love Tom Robbins in high school, and I think it's with a slightly guilty pleasure that I read his new works.  This one was pretty insignificant - by this point his themes are tired and he has nothing really to say.  The usual quirks and humorous metaphors that make his books so enjoyable were missing; or maybe I am just older?  Or I've just graduated to bigger and better stuff now?  His last book I remember being a little bit more substantial, but maybe not. <br /><br />

Frater's travelogue is one of the best I have read about India, probably because it focuses on the monsoon instead of trying to generally capture the spirit of India in 250 pages.  His writing is funny, honest, and he comes across as a bit of an asshole at times (but in a good way). Excellent balance of science/meteorology writing and travel narrative, and possibly because his journey partly matched my own I found this really satisfying.<br /><br />

Having experienced the Japanese mentality I can only emphasize how much better this read for me - but with subject matter like this it's going to be hard not to be compelling.  The interviews with survivors were actually a bit tedious, yet upsetting. It's the interviews with Aum members and ex-members that really makes this an incredible read - hearing firsthand about what life in a cult is like, and most interestingly hearing that many are still believers.  In a culture that is so materialistic, it's fascinating to hear about those who are rejecting that, even if it may lead to frightening results.<br /><br />

Not up to his last book's standard of course, but as an early transitional work it's good, and more "literature" than "sci-fi" (though I hate those terms).<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
I guess I am a relativist, but I just don't understand the need to be so dogmatic about music.  Prevost's book had some great insights into the creative process of improvised music, but the majority of it was near-inpenetrable "meta-musical" narratives.  His language is so dense - not even overly academic, just overly wordy - that when you really looked at what he was saying, a lot of the time it wasn't anything groundbreaking.  And his positions are needlessly absolute at times - especially with his views on the cultural meanings of musics, and the integration of traditional folk elements into rock and other musics.  While he argues well here, his book seems to deny the most visceral thrills that great music can produce.  But someone has to be AMM - someone has to be exploring in this direction, and I am grateful for everything they have given us.  The essay about music education was probably the high point of this for me.<br /><br />

Very interesting.  While reading I found this to be a strange, subtle comedy, mocking the ultra rich in the manner of Wodehouse (I assume).  A lot of the subtext I figured was lost on me.  But by the end I realized what a strange, mysterious novel this was.  The prose was clean, but disorienting; the narrative dull but oddly compelling at the same time.  And reading the introduction after finishing it, I was retroactively amazed by this novel (yet another example of literary criticism having too strong of an effect on my own judgement).  <br /><br />

Curtis White doesn't pull any punches in this critique of the American middle-class imagination. At times this reads like an extremely spoiled, snobby attack on everything sacred to American liberals (though he is attacking from the left); he delves into political rants often which are occasionally childish and feel very out of place (I thought academics weren't supposed to do things like this).  And I loved it - White articulates many things that seem taboo, and he perfectly expresses my hatred for American Beauty and it's mediocre embracing of traditional values masquerading as independent thought (finally, I am not alone!).  While i wouldn't recommend this as a solid argument, it's funny and in a case of "preaching to the converted" it's wonderful.<br /><br />

This has always been highly acclaimed as a masterpiece of modern fiction, etc. but I never knew much about it until I checked it out on a whim.  I loved this novel - I definitely would consider it a masterpiece.  Percy's writing is very gentle, and his narrative doesn't do anything tricky yet doesn't have much of a "story" to it anyway;  the tiny reflections of the narrator touch on the sense of the "sublime" that Curtis White was raving about in The Middle Mind - a contemplation of life's mysteries and celebration of the world.  Percy's descriptions of New Orleans are stilted and strange but beautiful in their own way.  Amazing.<br /><br />

Intense!  At first I was like "oh shit, this is basically straight pornography" but as it went on I started to see how, like Lanark, it mixes very personal, emotional writing with really insane fantastical metafiction.  Gray's character, whom is clearly not entirely him, is really laid bare and the workings of his mind are presented in a realistic manner.  Deep down, this is an extremely sad book and the dirty parts work not as titillation but to strengthen the sorrow.  The more metafictional/experimental/whatever aspects of Gray's style succeed to convey the disjointedness of the narrator's mind.  A fantastic book, on the level of Lanark but probably not as wide of an audience.<br /><br />

The story was good - well-planned, with a  nice surprising diversion into Antarctica - but his prose was completely unimaginative and bland.  I guess I would say that I liked this book in that I found it pleasant, story-wise - but great literature?  Come on, this is just like a beach book for the slightly more adventurous.  The comic book stuff was well-researched, which was nice, and Chabon does well at blending his characters in with history - but the only really interesting idea was of the artist becoming his creation, and it could have been explored a bit more.<br /><br />

I don't know why I've waited so long to read these.  Wilson is truly a genius; what I found most enlightening about these ideas is that they don't necessarily contradict with my own skepticism. It's easy to misinterpret his writing as a bunch of new age/occult crap, especially since the ideas are so fantastical, but Wilson is adamant that he doesn't actually believe in anything.  The idea that the human brain is chemically possible to create realities is certainly a way to look toward the future, and drugs/the occult, if anything, just seem like possible gateways to this.  Discordianism also apeals to me even more than before, once realizing that it's not a complicated joke disguised as a new religion, but a new religion disguised as a compliated joke.  I will have to re-read this because it's a lot to absorb.<br /><br />

I'm not sure that I loved this book, though it was humorous enough to keep my interest.  Krusoe reminds me of Donald Antrim - there's a similar sillyness but straightforward style as if it's normal - where there aren't really jokes in the writing, but just straight descriptions of strange, funny events.  There were some interesting things touched on here - memory, for one - but mostly I think it's a book about companionship, and our need for it.  Paul is detached enough to move from one close relationship to another, while trying to convince us of his absolutely commitment and devotion.<br /><br />

White's fiction is funny and features some of the interests I saw in his non-fiction (attacking Terry Gross and the lack of imagination) but never really comes together.  As a postmodern meditation on death and sexuality it's lots of fun, but it's too often derailed by diversions on beastiality and Internet pornography.  As an anarchic look at the relationships between classical music composers, modern religion, and fetishes, it's fine.  But it's not great as a lasting novel that I would want to read again or recommend.<br /><br />

A new David Foster Wallace collection - a cause for celebration?  Some of these stories were great - "The Suffering Channel" and "The Soul Is Not a A Smithy", specifically.  Others were almost unreadable.  This is the densest book he has ever written - pages and pages go by without any paragraph or line breaks.  And some stories achieve what he does best - writing about the inherent sorrow in contemporary America masked through a strange, somewhat irreverant facade.  "Oblivion" in specific has lots of "cute" gestures (like putting so many terms in quotes, though that does seem to actually call attention to how we manufacture meaning in so many terms) but ultimately is a moving, human story.  <br /><br />

I'm not sure why I like Jonathan Lethem so much.  He's fairly obsessed with superhero comics, which isn't a topic I'm particularly interested in, and he keeps dropping references to "cool" music which just sort of annoys me.  But his writing has the potential to tap into something really 'authentic', even if it's couched in sci-fi genre trappings.  This had some really fun stories and it was such a short read there's really nothing to complain about.  Of course it's not up to the standard of 'The Fortress of Solitude" but it has similar themes and was plenty enjoyable.<br /><br />

Why do I continually read books like this when I am always disappointed?  Another potentially interesting brainy thriller, a lot more restrained than the DaVinci Code but ultimately no more imaginative.  The puzzle at the center of the story isn't really elaborated on, which is a bit of a copout.  Also it's too much of a "college" novel.  The Hypernotomachia Polyphili content was interesting but so heavily fictionalized, and this proves to be yet another poor substitute for Foucalt's Pendulum.<br /><br />

I should read more Murakami since I love everything I've read by him, including this. A very strange narrative, even for Murakami, that was a lot more sci-fi than anything else I've read by him - but it was intercut with an almost Tolkeinesque fantasy half. The parallel narratives were set up well, though I found myself more interested in the Hardboiled Wonderland half. It's also interesting how the major action occurs in the middle of the book, and the end is a long, slow decline - sort of like Roeg's &quot;Eureka&quot;. I enjoy the calm detachedness of his narrators - it's something that makes more sense after being in Japan for a bit.<br /><br />

Lawrence Weschler is such an incredible writer than he can take pretty much any subject and make it interesting.  This collection is of more recent material, organized into thematic sections.  His writing about Eastern Europe shows that he understands the complexity of the situations there, and his pieces on Los Angeles actually cast the city in an appealing light.  When he writes about an artist, he highlights things I would never have realized about them but in an understated way, not showing them off as much as communicating for them.  While this doesn't have the humorous quirks of "Mr Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder" it's wonderful in an entirely different way.<br /><br />

I really like deBotton's approach to writing;  he writes about philosophy, but not in a boring way, and illustrates his points with examples from the history of art and philosophy.  The central question of this book is "Why are we so concerned with status?", and it points out how with all of the luxuries available in the modern world, we are still unhappy.  I think his writing has helped me to frame a lot of my own ideas about my life, and I found it inspirational in that aspect.  He mentions several ways to overcome status anxiety - art, politics, religion and bohemia - and it seems like a good way to look at things.  I don't think it will ever be possible to completely overcome status anxiety (and maybe not even desirable) but it's good to put things in perspective and think about how the modern Western psyche has developed over the past few centuries.  <br /><br />

Kafka on the Shore<br/ >
Haruki Murakami<br/ >
Source: LPL Central<br/ >
NULL<br/ >
Another vast Haruki Murakami construction that bears a resemblence to "Hard-Boiled Wonderland" in terms of structure, "Kafka" is perhaps a bit more ambitious.  The narrative is sweeping, delving into some of Murakami's familiar territory such as Freudian/sexual complexes, graphic violence, and the cold detached view of the world.  Like most of the things I have read, his character progress through the narrative in an unclear, predestined trajectory.  There were aspects of this novel that made it feel like one of his best works, such as the Mulholland Drive-esque mysteries and non-resolution, but there were also aspects that I didn't like.  The majority of these I will blame on the translation though - Philip Gabriel's prose seems more childlike than Alfred Birnbaum or Jay Rubin's.  I also don't understand the need to convert money to dollars but leave the rest of the context in modern Japan.  I don't know if I would recommend this as the first Murakami novel to read but it's certainly enjoyable, and another solid offering by one of the masters of contemporary surrealism.<br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
A new Harry Mathews book - wow!  The only reason it took me so long to read was because Dalkey sent me a Xerox of it and I found the format awkward.  I loved the first 50 pages because it was a weird, offbeat memoir about being involved in the French avant-garde in the 1970's. Then I realized that I was reading a novel, not a straight autobiography.  Mathews is so amazing when he turns on his weird, contrived humour, and sections of this book were undoubtably conceived through some sort of Oulipian method.  I was totally thrilled by certain passages, and as the novel got more and more ridiculous I kept enjoying it further.  As a fan of his other works, I enjoyed it even moreso- it felt closer to 'Tlooth' than any of his other books, and 'Tlooth' is probably my favorite of his.  I hope he writes a few more books, soon!<br /><br />

Every fucking David Markson book is exactly the same.  They are great, though.  People really seem to consider him to be one of the vanguard experimental novelists, but I don't really see what is so innovative about him.  He disposes of plot, character, sure - but to say that his books are much more than collections of observations about the creative process is giving him a bit too much credit.  I think "Wittgenstein's Mistress" was the best one because of the pretext of it, but they're all exactly the same fucking book.  He can keep them coming, and I'll keep reading them, but I don't think I'll ever rank him as one of my favorite writers. <br /><br />

I really love Christopher Hitchens - and I'm glad that I disagree with him on the War on Terror - and this book of essays reaffirmed my faith.  He shows his erudition in the literary excerpts, and except for some of the war-themed pieces I found this consistently enjoyable.  The essay about testifying against Mother Theresa to the Vatican was hilarious, and the piece on North Korea was absolutely terrifying (yet funny).  I really appreciate how dedicated he is to attacking the notion of the hero, and thus his even-handed viewpoint of Winston Churchhill was refreshing.  There are few writers who despise power and idoltary as much as Hitchens, and every word he writes is like a condemnation.  Lefties who have abandoned him because of a policy dispute are really missing out on a great mind.<br /><br />

The last essay in particular was so powerful because it's exactly about my life, and the Fortress of Solitude I have built in the Ninth Room, surrounded by the "books and all the records of my lifetime" (to make yet another reference here).  His writing is so passionate that it's hard not to love this, and his admissions are so accurate to my own life that it's almost embarassing at points.  <br /><br />

The topic of 1960's counterculture and it's influence on the PC industry is very interesting; unfortunately, this book did a poor job of presentation.

He did a poor job in conveying how these so-called countercultural values actually translated philosophically with these people; it was largely just stories about people inventing new hardware, and then taking acid and having orgies.  It also felt like he would occasionally forget what the topic was and then be like "Oh yeah, they hated Vietnam and smoked pot too." <br /><br />

There are criticisms galore - many "experimental" techniques that are nothing of the sort, most merely copouts to avoid having to actually write - but the book was so funny, smart and clever that I probably even liked it more than his first one (which I also wanted to hate).

The stories about the one-armed girl in Skye and the mountain climbing expedition were very nice; some of the others amused me, and others still were completely awful.<br /><br />

I had no idea this was so funny - totally over the top, obnoxious politically-incorrect Jewish-oriented humour that had me laughing throughout.  At times I'm reminded of Wallace Markfield - and then the novel actually makes a reference to Wallace Markfield!  Woody Allen seems almost second-rate after this.  Classic!<br /><br />

The latest Harry Potter book really didn't offer any surprises -- I sort of expected the big shocking thing at the end before it even came out. It was still fun, but noticeably more condensed than the last one, and missing a lot of the stuff I really liked about the longer books.  There was enough to keep me reading it quickly but I would have to say that this is a step down from the last two.<br /><br />

<p>It's been five years since I read this, and when I was packing up my books to store for the next year it caught my eye and I decided to re-read it.  This is a wonderful book that is both hilariously and mind-expanding, though on a surface level it's a dull, silly exercise in minutiae.  Baker's obsession with the mundane reveals a deep philosophy in the way things work, and the simple pleasures in everyday life.  This isn't as beautiful of a book as A Box of Matches but it's still great and it held up wonderfully on a second read.</p><br /><br />

Quite absurd fun!  I had trouble understanding much of this novel which was very Irish in it's sense of humour, feeling like a good bridge between Joyce and Flann O'Brien. There's a darkly comical feel to the story and the death at the end is strangely triumphant.  I must read more of Beckett's fiction! (and i have to, for class)<br /><br />

Quite readable and I guess remarkable because of it's non-linear narrative, which jumps back and forth through flashbacks.

This reads like a more in-depth final section of People's History and is easy to read and enjoyable.  There weren't many things that I didn't already know, though learning about McCarthyism a bit further was interested.  Zinn ends the book on a really hopeful note, seeming to believe that the social reforms of the late 60's were the gateway to a better tomorrow.  Reading it 30 years later, it's all the more tragic that the country has followed along this path.<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;3.5<br/ >
We are structuring our Special Topic around this book.  It's a brilliant look at the art of aerial bombing throughout history, cut up into chronological chunks and then reassembled through different patterns.  The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure format works well because you get a sense of chronology and repetition, but you aren't forced to read the book that way.  It benefits the topic, rather than just appearing gimmicky, because of the sense of destruction and displacement cause by bombing.  In some ways this is history, in some ways it's also political essay, journalistic, and personal.  It succeeds on all levels.<br /><br />

This was easier to read than I thought, and as these things go it was actually pretty enjoyable.  However, I still had trouble following it and a lot of things went over my head.  I think I really got a few ideas out of it, which oddly enough I was thinking about in relation to the Instal fest, but I don't know how much I missed.  It seemed a bit unfocused even within each chapter, as he would proclaim some ideas and then move onto the next, without giving me any way to really tie it together.  Perhaps I should try a longer work of his next.<br /><br />

This lost classic of 1920's English modernism is very, very strange - a dark, unresolving story that deals with the modern fascination with the ancient and esoteric in a similar way to Charles Portis, TS Eliot, and Pynchon.  The prose was actually quite difficult at time, reading somewhere between Joyce and Gaddis, and the ending was very compelling, as the narrative splintered and then reconverged.  I would have never heard of this writer if it wasn't for Professor Radford, so I am very glad to have had to read this because it definitely is something I will want to read again.<br /><br />

A very entertaining novel that's gimmick is the backwards life of a Nazi War criminal; of course the gimmicky aspects overshadow everything, but are also the most compelling reason to keep reading.

I would have preferred a little bit more mystery, and a little more of having to figure things out, like that film Memento.<br /><br />

Pascoe's theory was that Green was attempting to write a pastoral novel about the Blitz, but I think he had to radicalize the form by writing about the destruction of nature and the horrors of urbanity instead of the natural world.  Incredibly strong use of color here, and stylistically Green continues to intrigue me because he uses elements present in a lot of writing, but nothing overwhelming, ie: some stream of consciousness, but I wouldn't call him a SofC writer.  I really want to read more of his work as soon as this course is over!<br /><br />

First time in maybe eight years that I have read this?  Revisiting this in terms of the course I am taking, it's even more fun than I remembered.  Perhaps Vonnegut's absurdism comes as a release after the more serious accounts of aerial bombardment I have been reading.  The idea of the adynaton is certainly present, as Vonnegut basically says in the introduction that he is writing about Dresden because he feels obligated to, but obviously resorts to a pretty unusual way to talk about it.  The horror is glossed over to the point that it becomes more horrifying because it isn't dwelled upon.  <br /><br />

One of the best dystopian novels I have ever read - I love how the characters cling to the things they hold dear to them in the face of certain doom - objects, bureaucracy, family.  A very readable (if uninventive) style makes this a pretty gripping page-turner, despite the fact that nothing really happens in it.  And there's not even any chance of a hopeful outcome - from the beginning the cards are stacked against everybody.  <br /><br />

Very interesting and challenging book, in the same series as that Virilio I read earlier.  This attempts to dissect the reaction to 9/11 and argues against both Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberal democracy, showing how the two positions are hopelessly linked.  While there were parts of this that were lost on me, and some unclear ideas, I like all of the examples he used and the general style of the writing.  I may not have completely grasped his arguments, but I actually really enjoyed reading this.<br /><br />

Another brilliant and frustrating work by Delillo.  I think my interest in the topic has been enhanced by the course, yet I can't help but wish he avoided his usual stylistic flourishes.  This lacks the power of "The Names" or "White Noise" because it seems more confident in that power.  There were some very interesting ideas about the commercialization of terror factions, which I'm sure we'll discuss in seminar, but the more traditional elements of narrative/character felt uncertain, and even a bit unfinished.<br /><br />

Does Beckett's revelry in intellectual wordplay and artifice mean he is inherently mocking class structure?  Both Belacqua and Murphy are heroes who reject any sorts of vocation, and their class backgrounds are irrelevant.  Beckett's black humour and callousness towards the plight of the female characters showcases the spectacles of modern society and an unwillingness to commit to a moral judgement.  A copout?  Brilliant.<br /><br />

My memory of this book was that it was completely amazing and the best Delillo work by a longshot.  After re-reading it, I think I experienced the same effect - I wasn't really that into it while I was reading it, but a slow sinking enjoyment came after I finished it.  I still think this is his best book (of the ones I've read); it manages to perfectly walk the line between postmodern political relationships and bullshit without crossing over.  It's not the warmest of his texts, but that distance is exactly what makes it great.  It also touches on systems and numerology without going too deep, again the perfect balance.<br /><br />

This novel may actually be the most successful Delillo novel, but for a good reason - the typical DeLillo bullshit doesn't seem to be quite as dense here, for the subjects are very human and he's not trying to create an artificial distance between the reader and character as he does in Players, Running Dog, the Names, etc.  The warmth may be a bit of a false pleasure though, because the novel is completley obsessed with death in every way, a biting way to undercut the family dialogues.  This is a new approach to the bleak - instead of opting for black humour, DeLillo confronts the fear, not with acceptance but by trying to study it as much as possible.  <br /><br />

The Aesthetics of Disappearance, New Edition (Semiotext(e) / Foreign Agents)<br/ >
Paul Virilio<br/ >

Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
A quick read, though a lot of it went in my brain and out pretty quickly. Virilio attempts to theorize on absence and disappearance, looking through a child's brain and specifically at how cinema measures time.  Western society's obsession with speed is addressed as a method, a cause perhaps, of disappearing.  <br /><br />

Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography<br/ >
Chester Brown<br/ >
Source: Giles<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
Subtitled "A Comic Strip Biography," this examines the life of Louis Riel, who led the M?tis independence movement in the late 19th century.  Riel was an interesting character - passionately humane, and religious to the point of believing he was a prophet.  Brown's style works well to draw the reader into the historic period, and the scenes of battle are mapped out in a way that isn't confusing or overwhelming.  This will probably do wonders to promote the idea of comics as literature.  <br /><br />

This is great - extremely readable and conversational, which is the best way to read this type of thing.  Virilio (who dominates the dialogue) differentiates representation and presentation as two types of iconoclasm in art, and laments the death of a fixed point.  It's similar to Jameson's writing on the speed of history, and how nostalgia is permanently in flux.  <br /><br />

The novel that Stalker is based on is quite a bit different - Tarkovsky certainly tried to find a more allegorical feel in his adaptation.  This is a really fascinating, gripping sci-fi novel that is every bit as mysterious and inviting as the film.  The language is very straight-forward, even a bit coarse, so the more spiritual aspects of the film are filled in by my imagination.  The deeper exploration of the characters' backgrounds adds a new dimension, as the Stalker of the novel is a much more warm and empathetic figure.  <br /><br />

My impression is that the film is a radical departure from the novel, but after reading it I don't think that's true.  The basic difference is that Tarkovsky emphasized the humanist element, but as far as plot/narrative goes it's pretty spot-on.  This wasn't nearly as goofy as The Cyberiad.<br /><br />

His viewpoint is so unlike my own that it's really opened my eyes to a few things, and I'm especially impressed at how he tosses off comments without expanding on them that could be entire essays in their own.  <br /><br />

Now I'm psyched to tackle the new one, and then Mason & Dixon finally!<br /><br />

The French speakers would call this dated because of the slang of the time, but it's novelty still resonates in 2007.  Queneau's attempt to revolutionize language through the spoken word may not seem that radical today after years of Arno Schmidt and  other post-Joycean experimentalists, but the way that he manages to make it all such a fun "romp" justifies it's classic status.  Good implications of language as camoflauge, with the metro symbolising the subconscious and the hidden, and the child cutting through it like a knife.<br /><br />

At the same time the sense of play that I love in all of his writing is apparent, though seeping between the incredible power games portrayed.  <br /><br />

Theroux can actually write, and he does so with a surprising amount of honesty and self-deprecation.

And remembering the original shows wasn't a bad thing - though he's doing far better work now.  I'm curious what he'd be capable of doing in a second book, particularly if he moves away from the subjects of his TV shows and finds some new subjects.<br /><br />

I finally read this after putting it off for years, and while it was a bit slow-going at times, I got into weird moments where I was practically speedreading it, just letting the language completely overtake me.

Perhaps it's a true forebearer to postmodern literature because of that.<br /><br />

He seems to not believe that the neo-cons support free markets, which differs with Adam Curtis' view that they genuinely do believe in the philosophy they espouse.  What makes Curtis' documentaries so damning is that they portray the evil of the neocons without even discussing the illegal activities they partake in.<br /><br />

This book changed my life - it introduced me to so many countercultural ideas and people that I am still following paths that started with it, 15 years later.  And amazingly enough, the sequel just came out!<br /><br />

Ronson's style gets on my nerves - it's a bit too cute and quirky - and thus the subject matter started to feel almost fictional.

This was fun to read however, though I'll be steering far clear of that collection of his Guardian pieces.<br /><br />

Ian Clayton's memoir starts off wonderfully, as a stream-of-consciousness collection of early memories mixed in with popular culture references.  Later on, it's dragged into a repetitve list of famous musicians he's met and/or worked with, spoiling the otherwise pleasant contemplations about music and what impact it had on his life.  Still, I enjoyed it, as his writing is quick and amusing.  I don't really know why his life is supposed to be particularly interesting, and I guess it isn't.<br /><br />

There is something so incredibly wonderful about Richard Brautigan, and this first novel of his has it too while also having a bit more narrative than his other works.

The quirky absurdity that I love in his writing is woven into every page.  <br /><br />

This coupled with the "How To Brew" website should give me the theoretical backing I need to get really experimental with my future homebrews.  <br /><br />

Davis's book is a brilliant study of slum life around the world.  It's packed with statistics, almost becoming overwhelming, but then moves on to make an argument against the IMF and the World Bank.  The most compelling section for me was on "Slum ecology", detailing the terrible conditions that most people live in.  I also liked how he switched from city to city fluidly, without always saying what continent the city is in; I started to get confused, but it actually helped to portray the similarities of slum life all over the world.<br /><br />

Hofstadter ? hmmm? I'm not sure about this guy. This started off really promising, and reminded me a bit of Robert Anton Wilson's manner in Cosmic Trigger.  Of course I expected this to deal with extremely scientific terms and conceptual mathematics.  There were two math-heavy chapters that I was able to follow, but I started to feel that the book was really speculative, and almost like a pop psychology thing.  Also, Hofstadter's writing style began to irritate me, though to his credit he remained clear throughout - but what was with the continual "Dear reader"?  I guess I wanted something "harder".<br /><br />

Wheen's attack on the disappearance of reason over the past two decades reads like a lengthy article from The Baffler.  His viewpoint is not so cut-and-dry left, however - he rails against kneejerk leftwing reactions and has some damning criticism of Noam Chomsky.  But I loved this book - though it seemed to veer all over the place, there is not a weak chapter, and some sections are incredibly strong (like the attack on academic postmodernism).  It begins by talking about the rise of Thatcherism and the Islamic revolution, and I thought the entire book would be about that.  But that's material for Adam Curtis to explore. <br /><br />

A beautiful, calm book that contemplates man's relation to the natural world through the metaphor of geology.  Memory is a fragile, organic creature here, shown to be constantly shifting; the collection of human knowledge is another big theme that is explored by Geiser, attaching his notes to the wall.  Though the prose is very sparse, it's the mark of a great writer when a book can leave a physical effect on a reader.  Reading this, I really felt the torrents of rain, sensing the sound and rhythm of a downpour even though I read this at a time when it (strangely) wasn't raining here.<br /><br />

Tosches investigates the forgotten lore of Emmett Miller, a minstrel artist who recorded mostly in the late 1920's.  Of course, he's much more than a minstrel artist; more like a genre-defying symbol of a lost American heritage, this reads almost like a spooky mystery at times.  Tosches rhetorical flourishes and anti-intellectualism are feisty and wonderful at times; trying and immature at others.  Despite his obsession with Miller, by the end I was more focused on the general culture of the minstrel show and what it said about American attitudes towards race and tradition (despite Tosches' best attempts to avoid any sort of politicizing).<br /><br />

Cope's book was much more enjoyable than I thought; the personal approach never claimed to be anything else, and is writing is far more sharp than his acid-casualty image would suggest.  What I liked was how he distinctly avoided any sort of Nipponfile fetishisation, instead concentrating on the music and history.  It felt a bit disogranized, slightly repetitve and certainly incomplete, but that's the nature of Julian Cope isn't it?  It's made me curious to check out some music like Speed, Glue and Shinki and made me revisit Les Rallizes Denud?s, whom I haven't listened to in ages.<br /><br />

Reading this after recently reading Bryson's childhood memoir, I can't help but compare the two; while Bryson's is bittersweet and safe, Franzen's feels more honest, more neurotic, and far more philosophical.

Franzen's insights into art, relationships and family are so fucking real, yet delivered with a confidence and honesty rarely found outside of personal storytelling masters like Spalding Gray or Ross McElwee.  I wouldn't have thought this to be such a masterpiece, but it surprised me, and is one of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />

It actually felt quite a bit like Players or one of his books from that time, with 9/11 as the centerpiece, yet able to touch on more topics than just that.  There were some completley cringe-worthy sentences, but even the final section that describes the actual attack was surprisingly tasteful.<br /><br />

Another great PK Dick novel, this one maybe a little more straight-forward than Palmer Eldritch or Ubik.

The prose was so straightforward it almost felt like teen fiction, and I couldn't help but feel that this was one of those novels that gets great reviews in The Guardian.  Whenever Hoban dropped something interesting into the narrative, I found that I had lost interest by the time that element was fully realised.  <br /><br />

This is rightly regarded as one of the best novels of the 20th century; it captures a darkness that is absent in many other works in the canon.  Lowry's depiction of the Consul pulls no punches, and the dark depiction of Mexico is strangely alluring despite its malevolence.  It's not that the prose was particuarly special but the overall construction and theme of self-destruction; while staying in a setting removed from the Western first world, there is a powerful relevance.<br /><br />

Sure, it's nothing on Chromos but it does have some of the magic that I loved about it, specifically his freewheeling depiction of Bohemian eccentricities.  <br /><br />

Thought the author's a bit of a weiner (ba-dum-crash!) this was an awesome book.  It started slow and the writing didn't impress me as the most sophisticated I had ever read, but by the time of Nixon I was completely drawn in.  Told as a narrative, the history of the CIA is actually quite entertaining.  The facts are stunning, the ineptitude is unparalleled, and that all of the sources are on the record is even more amazing.  This reads as a brief overview of American foreign policy since WWII, which is always a good thing to be acquainted with.  The only bit of hope is that the CIA is shown to be much more fragile entity than I always thought.<br /><br />

I'm curious to read more by him - and I suspect if I had read this at a different time I might have been more receptive to it.  It fits in well thematically (though not stylistically) with other 60's revisionist Westerns, such as Brautigan's work or MacCabe and Mrs. Miller (close enough to the 60's for me).  I think I might try Mumbo Jumbo, for it's plot synopsis sounds fascinating in a Pynchon-lite kinda way.<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
Wow.  I expected this - which I put off for awhile until I was 'ready' for it (by reading other Dick novels first) - to be good, but it was completely incredible, and not at all incoherent like I feared.  Coming from the tradition of Robert Anton Wilson and <i>Cosmic Trigger</i> sorta stuff, <i>VALIS</i> gets into some really complex occult ideas, while masquerading as a (somewhat) sci-fi novel.  \n\nBut because it's based on Dick's own experiences, it has such a greater power.  Though it's actually fairly optimistic, there's a pain underneath everything - the loneliness of the experience, which is made the more isolated by the creation of characters to  share the experiences.  There's also some really harrowing descriptions of dislocation from reality, which are old hat after reading a few more Dick novels but more powerful in this one because of his closeness to it.  Additionally, he doesn't hide his own involvement with the material.  <br /><br />

Geometric Regional Novel<br/ >

Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
I found this slow-going - kinda boring - but by the end I started to really appreciate it.  At first I found the bureaucratic parody to be tired and inconsistent, but that's the point. There's some wonderfully Pythonesque humour buried beneath the poetics, and some wonderful poetics buried beneath the bureaucracy.  A lot of the 'impact' of this book comes from it's subversion of the German 'regional novel' genre, which I know absolutely nothing about.  But disregarding that it still held up as a strange synthesis of Butor's <i>Mobile</i> and  what I've always imagined Austrian postwar fiction to be like (which is based on cultural stereotypes and the one Thomas Bernhard novel that I read).<br /><br />

I wish I had started with this book when I started hombrewing.&nbsp; The <em>beginner</em> beer - the one they walk you through in the first chapter to teach you how to brew - is an intense 9% ale with maple syrup and Belgian candy.&nbsp; There are recipes inside for Midas Touch, India Brown Ale and Raison D'Etre - sadly not the Chicory Stout, but there's a licorice root stout that I'm sure is pretty similar.&nbsp; The Dogfish Head dude can actually write, and he seems to have a good, open-minded attitude towards brewing (not that I'm surprised by this given his products).&nbsp; I almost feel like I've stumbled across a secret that isn't known on this side of the ocean. I can't wait to brew an extreme beer - I'm thinking of using honey and elderflowers and maybe even some Lyle's Golden Syrup.<br /><br />

<p>Supposedly Pinget's greatest work, <em>The Inquisitory</em> is a 400 page interrogation that doesn't contain a single full stop (well, I stopped looking after awhile).&nbsp; The device is used in a manner akin to that chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>, though without the smirking humour.&nbsp; Pinget uses this interrogation to outline the characters of history of his fictional town, Agapa - his Yoknapatawpha county.&nbsp; </p><p>Though there's some real moments in here, I found myself bored by the narratives.&nbsp; Hundreds of characters and their histories were described, but nothing was particularly memorable to me.&nbsp; I suspect that it's a fairly realistic portrait of provincial French life, but that's not what I came looking for here.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Re-reading this cemented it's place in my pantheon of great books.&nbsp; I picked up on a much darker undercurrent to Bollings this time; the first time through it felt like a Southern American version of <em>L'Estranger</em>, but balanced by a gentle, almost pastoral beauty.&nbsp; I felt the strength of his descriptions of air, light, and smell even stronger this time, which made the dark aspects feel even darker.&nbsp; The detachment extends to an almost predatory treatment of women, yet still strangely celebratory; it's a troubled portrayal, though one that doesn't have to interfere with the connection I made to this text.&nbsp; I've never been interested in any of his other books but maybe I should check one out.&nbsp; I don't usually go for these heavy books about searching for the meaning of life, but that's exactly why I connect with this - because it's not heavy, it's almost ridiculously lighthearted and escapist.&nbsp; By avoiding dealing with anything &quot;real&quot;, Percy manages to write about something without actually writing about it.<br /><br />

Source: Govanhill library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
<p>Klein's look at 'disaster capitalism' is a remarkable effort that excels about the typical political study for several reasons.&nbsp; What I liked most is the way she weaves a narrative throughout, taking the concept of 'shock' beyond a mere metaphor and parallelling economic policies with torture and psychological treatments.&nbsp; </p><p>Rather than being merely about Iraq and Katrina (as I expected), the first 2/3 of the book consists of case studies in previous nations and their adoption of privatization and corporate rule.&nbsp; I now see Milton Friedman as one of the 20th century's greatest villains (just behind Hitler, Stalin, Kissinger, et al).&nbsp; The research is impressive and the argument never wavers, though it never feels overly preachy or self-righteous.&nbsp; The studies of Chile and Russia in particular are fascinating and a serious alternative to the popular viewpoint.</p><p>When she does get into Iraq, the outrage is contained enough to be effective; the finger is pointed however, and the accusations are quite damning.&nbsp; Klein doesn't waste space arguing about the morality of the war, instead focusing on the corporate profiteering that resulted from it, which is even more shocking than I had imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>The final section deals with the recent populist movements in South America and actually leaves me with a great deal of hope for the future (moreso than these kinds of books usually do). However, I am left with great doubts that a democratic administration in America will do anything to alter the course of globalisation.&nbsp; It's rare for me to find a book about politics that is so good I can't put it down, but this is completely excellent and hopefully will be read by a lot of people. &nbsp; </p><br /><br />

<p>As a one-day read this was fun enough, but given the high quality of Lethem's other output I felt like this was a real regression.&nbsp; I like Lethem's Philip K Dick obsession, which was absent in this novel (apart from a radio station called KPKD).&nbsp; The first half of the novel felt like it was written by Don DeLillo, with it's extended, 'profound' dialogues and exaggerated social constructs. Then the emphasis on the rock band took over and the entire novel felt very, I dunno, lame.&nbsp; </p><p>Lethem is certainly older than me, but he seemed to be chronicling a subculture and lifestyle that I myself have already graduated from.&nbsp; I realise that's not a fair criticism and it reeks of arrogance and elitism, but the actions of a rock band in LA feel like the most worn out ideas.&nbsp; It's awkward too - I've always felt a slight awkwardness in Lethem, as I would feel reading anyone who comes from a similar cultural background yet directly addresses that background - and it's more pronounced here than in any other book of his.&nbsp; In <em>The Fortress of Solitude</em> the comic book and music themes work well, as their fictionialisation feels natural.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I've been so immersed in the world of rock music for so long, but everything felt false and a bit desperate in<em> You Don't Love Me Yet</em>. </p><br /><br />

This is definitely a 'lesser' Dick novel, but still greatly enjoyable.&nbsp; It's made me think about how most of his novels are really about the concept of 'freedom', questioning what it really means in the nature of Bunuel's <em>The Phantom of Liberty</em>.&nbsp; In most of his books there is some sort of police state, yet with a twisted catch.&nbsp; Here (as in many of his books), drugs are legal and state-regulated, but alcohol is completely illegal and 'underground'.&nbsp; There wasn't as much of a total reality mindfuck as his best books have, and it felt a bit more Kilgore Trout-like.&nbsp; This is not necessarily bad, but it's not one I think I'll ever re-read.<br /><br />

I wanted to read this because it's by one of <em>The Wire</em>'s main writers, who is very highly acclaimed in this genre.&nbsp; Well, this is my first foray into 'crime fiction' and probably my last.&nbsp; This book was abysmal.&nbsp; It wasn't merely bad because of the one-dimensional characters, cliched stereotypes and apalling dialogue.&nbsp; What really wrecked it for me was the obsession with placing everything into a historical timeframe - in this case, 1986.&nbsp;&nbsp; No more than a few pages go by before Pelecanos makes a reference to an album, sporting event or TV show.&nbsp; The musical dialogue is particuarly bad, such as the punks talking about going to see Black Flag.&nbsp; &quot;Rollins?&quot; one of them says.&nbsp; Just so you know.&nbsp; It reminds me of that Monty Python sketch with the railway timetable-obsessed playwrite, whose plays just involve a bunch of characters talking about railway timetables.&nbsp; But really, this was just a really bad book.&nbsp; And given the accolades on the cover, it's probably one of the more reknowned of the genre, which doesn't realy say a lot about the genre.&nbsp; I can see how some of the &quot;grit&quot; of this guy's approach might filter into <em>The Wire</em>, but thankfully, David Simon is there to induce a good bit of cynicism and deal with the more complex relationships of power, bureaucracy and the self.<br /><br />

Source: University library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
A quick flip to the index reveals the value of this book -- what, no Wolf Eyes?!?!&nbsp; Seriously though, Hegarty has set out to write a history of noise in music as he loosely defines noise.&nbsp; And perhaps that is the book's biggest weakness - to him, 'noise' varies between commercial antagonism, harsh social aesthetics, a sense of discomfort - without ever being really pinned down.&nbsp; He most frequently returns to Batallie, describing a sense of negation that has no resolution.&nbsp; Musically, Hegarty sticks strictly to the 20th century though he does step across all genres pretty well.&nbsp; It's really just one man's view, tempered by occasional rants about Adorno's critquie of Jazz etc, but it's not a bad viewpoint, and avoids being dismissive.&nbsp; It's the kind of book I imagine we're going to see a lot more of, as this sort of thing is being studied much more these days, but I doubt that most of them will be this readable. His chapter on Merzbow is the highlight of the book, an impassioned, slightly crazed attempt to place Masami Akita in some sort of framework.&nbsp; Also great is his nine step program to view the Sex Pistols' <em>The Great Rock and Roll Swindle </em>as noise, in a way illustrating the absurdity behind the book's entire project.&nbsp; Chapters on Kraturock, Jazz and DJ culture, while obviously focused around the writer's biases, weave together a narrative pretty well but without actually teaching me anything new.&nbsp; I wouldn't give this a blazing 5 star review, but it certainly wasn't bad.<br /><br />

The second book in the <em>VALIS</em> trilogy was significantly more fictional than <em>Valis</em>, even ridiculously so.&nbsp; Dick's theological concerns become extremely overt here, with the personification of God etc. almost reaching the absurd heights of Pratchett and Gaiman's <em>Good Omens</em>.&nbsp; But everytime I thought the story was getting cliched or easy, it shifted gears again.&nbsp; The universalisation of Dick's internal struggle takes away a bit of it's extremism, but I still really enjoyed this.&nbsp; I don't think it has to be read as an acceptance of Christianity; it can be seen as philosophical entertainment using Christian devices.<br /><br />

This collection of essays was all fixed around one provocative piece Baudrillard wrote, &quot;The Conspiracy of Art,&quot; in which he basically declares all art to by null and empty.&nbsp; The reactions are varied but many seem to misunderstand his approach - that he is talking about the anthropological value of art rather than the aesthetic.&nbsp; Like Lotringer's books with Virilio, I found this most enjoyable when in conversational mode.&nbsp; Baudrillard is anything but obtuse; his viewpoints are clearly stated and not even particularly radical.&nbsp; The stuff at the end about Artaud I didn't get much from, as I'm not very familiar with Artaud.&nbsp; But throughout the rest, I was continually thinking about the trap defined by Baudrillard - the void of contemporary art - and trying to think of ways out of the predicament.&nbsp; Especially after reading the Hal Foster book - I think these two men have pretty different viewpoints, though one is an 'insider' and one is not.&nbsp; I also liked the stuff about Warhol, who I have always taken a bit for granted.<br /><br />

My first proper McGuane novel (my interest was stirred by a <em>Believer</em> article awhile back) and I was quite happy with what I found.&nbsp; The humour so often spoken about McGuane's style was distinct and sharp, but not the centerpiece of the book.&nbsp; I would have never thought a story about fishing guides in the Florida Keys would be so entertaining, but it succeeded, reminding me of a lost Coen Brothers script especially in the middle with all the short, episodic scenes.&nbsp; But throughout the narrative lies more than the occasional brilliant turns of phrase - more 'grounded' than the postmodernists of the time and as attenuated as the best words of Kerouac, Walker Percy, or Updike.&nbsp; I'll seek out others, and try to find the film adaptation as well. <br /><br />

The last Philip K. Dick novel ends in the most brutal, crushing way possible before offering a glimpse of hope, but I can't overcome my own cynicism to believe in it.&nbsp; Like <em>Valis</em> and <em>The Divine Invasion</em>, this is primarily concerned with direct transmissions from an alien intelligence.&nbsp; If <em>Valis</em> was his struggle to come to terms with his own experiences, and <em>Divine Invasion</em> was an attempt to place it into a theological context, then <em>Radio Free Albemuth</em> takes these experiences back to what he is familiar with - the science-fiction/dystopian context, with a bit of the alternate history thing thrown in. I really enjoyed this novel - it's a fitting swan song to an incredible writing career.&nbsp; I wonder if he had lived for 20 more years, if he would have kept writing and rewriting about Valis; I don't know why this isn't considered part of the trilogy as it seems to fit into place.<br /><br />

This is Murakami's &quot;normal&quot; novel, a coming-of-age story set in 1969-1970 Tokyo and centered around a student's romantic entanglements.&nbsp; It's so conventional compared to what I was expecting that I spent the first half waiting for something 'weird' to happen.&nbsp; Once I realised that this was a different sort of novel, I began to really appreciate it.&nbsp; Without the detached surrealism of his other books, Murakami allows his writerly qualities to really shine.&nbsp; This is the novel that made him hugely successful in Japan, and I can see why - it addresses sex and relationships in a really honest manner.&nbsp; This isn't the type of novel I typically read but it carries a certain magic that I found hard to resist.<br /><br />

Somehow I've managed to put off Dick's most famous book until now; it is definitely the last of his 'major' works and well-deserving of the accolades.&nbsp; I kept expecting a twist ending that never came, yet I wasn't disappointed in any way.&nbsp; There are some brilliant ideas in here, like kipple, or useless objects that keep multiplying.&nbsp; I'm gonna watch <em>Blade Runner</em> now, which I haven't seen since high school and remember nothing from.<br /><br />

This collection of Dick's nonfiction is really solid. The bits of biographical information are interesting enough that I think I'm going to read some biographies of him; the writings on science fiction are especially rewarding as they attempt to lay out a 'theory' of sci-fi (if such a thing exists).&nbsp; The book gets progressively more difficult to read as it goes on; the meaty essays on reality are the peak, sharing a lot of similar ground to Robert Anton Wilson's writings though with Dick's own interests in Christian theory laid on top.&nbsp; They are fairly disorganised but lay bare Dick's thoughts on his own experiences, making some outrageous claims that I'm sure he truly experienced.&nbsp; The essay on cosmogony was impossible to understand and I skimmed it; I made it through the excerpts from the <em>Exegesis</em> but they were dense and difficult as well.&nbsp; (I imagine reading the entire <em>Exegesis</em>, were it possible, would be pretty mental)&nbsp; This makes me ready to read more of his fiction.<br /><br />

This is the first Bola&ntilde;o book I've read; given the hype about him I expected something totally dazzling.&nbsp; This novel was quite enjoyable to read, and raised some interesting questions about the relationship between art and politics.&nbsp; The main character of the novel is ruthlessly avant-garde and ruthlessly bloodthirsty; it's an interesting idea, as avant-garde movements are usually affiliated with the left (well, usually) and Bola&ntilde;o's character straddled so many movement he became a force of his own.&nbsp; It's interesting how realistic this novel was; I was never sure if the writers and politicians he describes were fictional or not.&nbsp; It's setting in 1970's Chile is of course charged with the blood of Allende and the horrible things that happened there, yet this doesn't become the focal point of the book.&nbsp; I like the contrast between the many poor victims of Pinochet's reign, who unfortunately 'disappeared', with Wieder, who volintarily disappeared.&nbsp; I can't quite understand&nbsp; how this guy also write an 800 page surrealist masterpiece (or so the hype claims - <em>2666</em> doesn't come out in English until this fall) yet this book was strikingly realistic.&nbsp; <br /><br />

If I can keep reading a Dick novel per day I'll actually get through his entire bibliography well before the end of the year.&nbsp; Though I must admit, at points in <em>Cantata-140</em> I was regretting reading it, for it had some of the most dire, turgid, poorly-written parts Ive yet encountered in Dick.&nbsp; However, the narrative was brilliant - and quite timely, being that it concerns a black Presidential candidate.&nbsp; This novel is very much about race; as it was written in 1966 it's surely motivated by the civil rights movement (and I suspect the Jim Briskin character is based on MLK).&nbsp; It's clunkyness is probably why it's remembered as one of Dick's minor works, and it certainly doesn't contain any reality-spinning elements like <em>Palmer Eldritch</em> or <em>Ubik</em>. Originally published as <em>The Crack in Space</em>.<br /><br />

This biography doesn't cite any specific sources yet seems to have a complete understanding of Dick's internal throughts throughout his life, though the author never met Dick.&nbsp; It's also prone to fanciful flights of prose that attempt to capture the distressed mental state of its subject, yet come off as high school sci-fi poetry.&nbsp; Despite these flaws, this was hard to put down, as Dick's life was completely fascinating.&nbsp; Many of his experiences ended up somewhere in his novels, even with Carr&egrave;re doesn't specify that.&nbsp; I sorta wish I had read the other Dick biography because it's probably better, yet I doubt I will bother reading a second bio. <br /><br />

The Transmigration of Timothy Archer<br/ >
Philip K. Dick<br/ >
Source: eBay<br/ >
Cost: &pound;4.45<br/ >
This is the proper &quot;final&quot; novel of Philip K Dick and by far the most distinct and singular of his works.&nbsp; For starters, it isn't science fiction at all but rather a mediation on psychology and theology.&nbsp; It's also written from the point of view of a woman.&nbsp; As far as its <em>writerly</em> qualities, this is probably the best prose that Dick ever wrote.&nbsp; It rolls with a detached awareness that reminds me a lot of Delillo's writing, only avoiding some of the excessses.&nbsp; I hesitate to proclaim this to be Dick's best book, but in some ways it's the masterpiece of &quot;serious&quot; literature he wanted to write so badly in the 50's.&nbsp; It's extremely autobiographical and the resemblence to Bishop Pike is only thinly disguised; Dick was obviously working with some residual demons and trying his best to assert a wide spectrum of beliefs in one novel.&nbsp; But is Dick renouncing the fantastic and the supernatural, as his narrator does, or does he present a more ambiguous argument?&nbsp; Furthermore, is this the work of a man who knew his death was imminent?&nbsp; Death pervades every page of this novel - it begins the day after John Lennon was shot and follows the deaths of three major characters, though none of them occur in the novel but are merely talked about.&nbsp; The character of Bill is almost certainly doomed, and Angel's attempts to save him are presented pessimistically, as if we know it will fail.&nbsp; For a novel that deals with death so much, Dick presents the &quot;life after death&quot; idea very cynicaly, in a way that suggests that it wouldn't even be desirable if at all possible.&nbsp; The Bishop's foundations of faith are shaken, just as the real life Bishop Pike's are, and Dick's faith in fiction falls apart as well.&nbsp; It makes sense that he never wrote again, as there's little left for him to say at this point.&nbsp; Thinking about this as a trilogy with <em>Valis</em> and <em>Divine Invasion</em> makes it a hell of a weird trilogy - the only concept of Valis here would be the discussions of ancient Christian illumination; what Dick writes is the amnesis, the opposite of his anamnesis.&nbsp; It is a forgetting o f his understanding and experiences; it is a return to what is concrete, an attempt to ascertain something grounded.&nbsp; Maybe that makes this the biggest tragedy he ever wrote.<br /><br />

It's hard not to think about <em>The Truman Show</em> when reading this but the same basic concept applies, though with a sci-fi story grafted on.&nbsp; This is apparently a real turning point for Dick, and as it's the earliest of his novels that I've read I can't say for sure.&nbsp; It certainly felt a bit more thorough than his crazed 60s work.&nbsp; It's a nice biting commentary on the placid life of Eisenhower America, and it certainly looks to the future with a strange prescience.&nbsp; The afterword suggests the ending &quot;sci-fi&quot; section was tacked on just so he could get it published, and suggests that it's forced and unnecessary.&nbsp; Maybe this is true; as Dick wrote so many 'serious' novels at this time (all unpublished during his lifetime), it does show in the relative calm of the first 150 pages.&nbsp; As a document of paranoia and conspiracy this also precedes the works of Pynchon and DeLillo; strangely it comes across as a more conventional novel than Pynchon would write despite being about the moon attacking the Earth.<br /><br />

What an awesome book!&nbsp; It started slow but then became a very strange murder mystery, with some extreme sci-fi elements that were pretty secondary to the story.&nbsp; This was about human relationships and the religious framework people impose on things; it started to feel ridiculous and gothic as the corpses started piling up.&nbsp; There's some feel to this that makes it 'stand apart' from Dick's other work, maybe the sex or maybe the &quot;thriller&quot; feel to it.&nbsp; The ending isn't a cop out but coulda been handled a bit differently, though I generally hate when people complain about a narrative going a direction they don't like (so I'll shut up).<br /><br />

The saving grace of reading all of these Dick books in succession (and running the risk of actually going insane myself) is that they are so varied.&nbsp; While there are themes that repeat across his fiction, each individual book really stands alone and apart from one or two, they don't feel unnecessary.&nbsp; <em>Galactic Pot-Healer</em> is again probably a &quot;minor&quot; work in his canon, yet I felt a special fondness while reading it.&nbsp; The most distinct characteristic of this novel is the humour - it is downright silly, with slapstick humour and weird jokes in the dialogue that made this feel a lot like a Dogulas Adams book.&nbsp; Or maybe even Red Dwarf.&nbsp; The idea of a deity who kinda fucks up a lot and is extremely fallible is a good one, but it's his personality - he's a <em>goof</em> - that made this seem so far removed from the nightmares of <em>Palmer Eldritch</em> or <em>Ubik</em>.&nbsp; At the beginning it almost felt like a parody of Dick's frequent police states; and I actually thought it was going to have a happy ending for once.&nbsp; <br /><br />

It's easy to imagine Dick bashing this book out, his brain riddled with amphetamines and trying to just write as many books as possible.&nbsp; That's not to say I didn't enjoy it - I enjoy them all - but the writing style is very stunted, almost like he meant to go back later and fill things in.&nbsp; There's similar &quot;hoax&quot; material like in <em>The Penultimate Truth</em>, though here the weapon industry is presented as linked to toy and commerce (which is pretty realistic) and the society exists in a relatively free (at least for a Dick book) capitalist manner.&nbsp; The most &quot;messed-up&quot; aspect of <em>The Zap Gun</em> is that something just isn't right about it - but in this case its' due to sloppy writing rather than a twisted reality-warping vision.<br /><br />

This is Paul Theroux's first travel book, where he embarks on a rail journey from London to Vietnam to Japan to Siberia and back to London.&nbsp; This pretty much created the modern travel writing genre and is suprisingly funny - hilarious actually - even if Theroux's mid-70s attitudes towards other cultures aren't the most completely politically correct.&nbsp; Unlike a writer such as Bryson, Theroux doesn't have a wide-eyed fascination with his subjects. He is actually somewhat grumpy and cynical, and he writes more about sitting on trains than the actual countries he is visiting.&nbsp; Still, I loved it, and his depictions of India are the most vivid and accurate I've come across.&nbsp; This is probably the best travel writing book ever.<br /><br />

Here, I just didn't care - I wanted to get it over with.&nbsp; His usual mystery and ambiguity just bored me.<br /><br />

Source: Govanhill library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
<p>I didn't know what to expect from this book, as I guess I never know what to expect from Nicholson Baker.&nbsp; It's quite controversial, probably because it argues that WWII was not a &quot;good&quot; war - if you tend to read it that way.&nbsp; Baker does little writing of his own here, apart from a few sentences between quotes of primary sources (almost all from the <em>New York Times</em>).&nbsp; Of course it's his choice of information that makes his argument, painting Churchhill to be a monster of the empire, and the pacifist movement as an oppressed, marginalized voice (which they were).</p><p>I found this fascinating - I had trouble tearing myself away from it - in the way that the most gripping thrillers occupy the mind and body.&nbsp; His chronological presentation of information is a simple, yet incredible method for placing the reader in the context of Europe in the 1930's.&nbsp; It's made me rethink the ways in which I learned of World War II - which I guess was the standard public school education. &nbsp; <em>Human Smoke</em> is also a great nonfictional complement to Vollmann's <em>Europe Central</em>. &nbsp;</p><p>I intentionally avoided reading criticism of this before I read it, though I suspect there's a general outrage when anyone questions the unassailable reverence of World War II and &quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot; etc.&nbsp; Maybe some feel that Baker - a weirdo novelist with childlike outbursts (<em>Checkpoint, Vox)</em> and whose only previous work of nonfiction is a ridiculous attack on newspaper digitisation - has no place in writing a work of history.&nbsp; But what I think is great about this book is that it illustrates the very instability of history via viewpoints.&nbsp; In a way I think the meta-textual ideas behind this book make it very interesting - perhaps moreso than the actual content.&nbsp; It's sourced and noted thoroughly, so what makes this any different than the plethora of pro-WWII texts (at least from an academic point of view)?&nbsp; As always I want to defend Baker; now I am curious to read the criticism.</p><p>I'm a pacifist myself, of course, but his case was a hard one to make without just playing a bunch of historical &quot;What if?&quot; games. Sure, Churchhill loved the war and was obsessed with total non-negotiable victory; I also believe that Roosevelt was happy to enter the war and &quot;let' Pearl Harbor happen.&nbsp; And maybe Hitler was prepared to negotiate a peace deal in 1940.&nbsp; But no one can really know what would have happened if the war had ended in 1940 - if Hitler would have stopped after Poland, or if the holocaust still would have happened (since Britain and US weren't allowing any Jews to resettle there).&nbsp; So it's great that this book debunks a lot of the bullshit myths about it being &quot;the good war&quot;, but to condemn it and say that fighting wasn't inevitable is impossible. I don't think the argument is that strong anyway - I think a lot of it feels like Baker trying to understand World War II through his own pacifist eyes - and often presenting both sides of the argument.&nbsp; I think I will probably read this again. </p><br /><br />

John Gray<br/ >
Source: Govanhill library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
This book actually was far more about politics than religion, or rather the way that utopian and apocalpytic religious thoughts patterns exist in political ideology.&nbsp; Gray compares the post-Communist view that western liberal democracy is the &quot;only&quot; form of government as being equivalent to saying there is a goal, or a utopia at the end of society.&nbsp; He claims this belief is distinctly Western and then moves through a series of political situations to illustrate his point, from Thatcher's dismantling of the British state to Blair's continuation of her status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It all culminates in Bush and Iraq, where rather than simply illustrate how Bush believes America's actions are dictated by God, Gray actually dissects the rhetoric of the war and makes a clear distinction between neo-liberal and neo-conservative.&nbsp; At times it feels a bit jumbled and unfocused, but this was a great book with some really sharp critiques of contemporary political and economic though.&nbsp; At the end it makes a case for a realist approach to civilisation, which I didn't completely understand, and also starts to talk about the need for a post-secular society.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever read an argument against secularism from the left before, and I'd like to see it expanded into it's own book, as Gray tacks it into the frantic concluding chapter.<br /><br />

Why autobiography?&nbsp; I've always felt it's a weakness of &quot;my&quot; generation's approach to art and literature, especially evident in forms such as 'new' journalism and successful memoirs of people who have never done anything interesting, like Dave Eggers.&nbsp; But this book takes it to a new level by portraying a childhood so warped that it is profoundly disturbing and incredibly funny.&nbsp; Burroughs episodic memoir is very very dark, and strangely engrossing.&nbsp; It upends my romanticism of Western Massachussets as an evolved, intellectual haven and shows a dark undercurrent lurking beneath - in this way, it strangely reminds me of <em>Blue Velvet</em>.&nbsp; Except far more funny - a thirteen year old boy getting molested by a 33-year old man has never been this funny.&nbsp; Burroughs writes with the perfect amount of affect to convey the insanity of his world and the foibles of false maturity.&nbsp; I would gladly read a sequel (or a rebuttal written by one of the other characters).<br /><br />

<p>This is part of the 'short circuits' series of books, which encourages unusual readings of texts, or something like that.&nbsp; I feel a bit worn out from this, as I stuggled to focus on Zizek's argument but found it constantly evading me.&nbsp; My background in philosophy and psychoanalysis is a layman's, so I was challenged to comprehend all of the twists and turns in this text.&nbsp; And even if I got the gist of what he was saying at one point, I wasn't always to fit it into the larger narrative.&nbsp; I undersatnd the basic core arguments for why he views Christianity as perverse, but I felt that this book was out of my grasp as a whole entity.&nbsp; Still, it was rewarding to read.&nbsp; I jotted down a lot of interesting notes in the first half before giving up and just going for the ride.&nbsp; I think this was a good followup to the <em>Black Mass</em> book I just read, because both deal with belief in the way it applies to social order.&nbsp; I will read this again at some point and feel more in control, I guess; in the meantime I'll dance around some other Zizek, for his star shines bright.</p><br /><br />

The Spirit of Terrorism: And Requiem for the Twin Towers<br/ >
Jean Baudrillard<br/ >
Source: University library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
This ultra-quick read is from the same Verso series that produced Virilio's <em>Ground Zero</em> and Zizek's <em>Welcome to the Desert of the Real</em>.&nbsp; In two short essays, Baudrillard talks about the symbolic power of terrorism and the aesthetic impact of the World Trade Centre collapse.&nbsp; It's actually fairly lightweight compared to the other two in this series, which I am going to re-read now.&nbsp; If anything I found myself thinking about how &quot;over&quot; 9/11 we are already - much quicker than I thought - which seems to validate Virilio's views of <em>dromos</em>.&nbsp; Baudrillard talks about the then-forthcoming war on terror as the fourth world war, but there aren't many groundbreaking ideas here.&nbsp; <br /><br />

The Use and Abuse of History: or How the Past is Taught to Children (Routledgeclassics)<br/ >
Marc Ferro<br/ >
Source: University library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
Ferro's study looks at how different cultures present their own histories to children, and asks questions about the purpose of such histories.&nbsp; The conclusions are nothing shocking - history is taught to encourage patriotism and smooth over controversy - but the process itself is what makes this so compelling.&nbsp; By selecting quotes from these children's textbooks and then commenting on them, Ferro presents a brief overview of all of these cultures histories and looks at the specific issues of each one, such as the Armenians' sense of identity and the Aborigines own cyclical view.&nbsp; In the process I actually learned a lot of history, though it was so overwhelming I found myself skimming parts and quickly forgetting names and dates.&nbsp; This was written in 1980 and updated slightly to reflect the 1980's and the fall of communism, though I suspect the basic point is still the same.<br /><br />

It's not easy to write a 'review' of this book, as it's a list of references/explanations throughout <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>.&nbsp; It enhanced <em>GR</em> in the greatest imaginable manner, while still being incomplete (of course).&nbsp; It highlighted themes that I would have never otherwise picked up on, and provided the years worth of scholarship that I would never be able to achieve myself.&nbsp; Weisenburger's own voice is rather muted as he lets Pynchon do the talking, so I can't say I got much of a feel for the 'style' of his annotations.&nbsp; There is apparently an updated version of this that has been expanded, and I may buy it before I give <em>GR</em> a fourth 'go'.<br /><br />

<em>The Simulacra</em> had the potential to be Dick's greatest novel ; it's construction could have been epic, but it winds up quickly in only 200 pages.&nbsp; If this novel was about twice as long, it would<br />&nbsp;have been amazing.&nbsp; As it is, I liked this a lot and think it's among Dick's better books.&nbsp; Put into 'real' terms (though reading Dick by now has made me skeptical of such terms), you can imagine this as the Hillary Clinton-led future America, with Nazis coming back from the past, representatives from the Ocora label attempting to record a psychokinetic Conlan Nancarrow, and a battle between corporations for the right to build the next George W.

In this thriller, Dick tackles games and chance, but gets into the uncertainty of his best work, with the possibility of alien invaders masquerading as human.&nbsp; It's not that simple, though; there's divisions of trust that extend beyond racial lines, which confuses the protagonist.&nbsp; LIke Dick himself, the protagonist is addicted to pills and has extreme, suicidal moods.&nbsp; This planet Earth resembles the empty, dying Earth of <em>The Penultimate Truth</em>.&nbsp; I've read three Dick novels in three days and all have been excellent; sadly, I only see two more on my shelf and only a few more after that before I've read them all!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />

Clans of the Alphane Moon<br/ >
Philip K. Dick<br/ >
Source: eBay<br/ >
Cost: &pound;3.49<br/ >
Another of Dick's better books, i think, <em>Clans of the Alphane Moon</em> moved from the story of a crumbling marraige (which passages that surely came from Dick's failed non-fiction books) to a spy thriller.&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying theme is that of mental illness, as it addresses the settlements on the Alphane Moon as various races, echoing their ailments like a weird caste system.&nbsp; The subplot about writing the TV show is probably a product of Dick's own failure to support himself commercially, and his hero's reluctance is maybe a rationalisation of this failure.&nbsp; The telepathic slime mold reminded me a bit of Glimmung from <em>Galactic Pot-Healer</em>, though without as much sillyness to it.&nbsp; Also interesting is that the world in this novel is much less of a totalitarian state than in his other ones, almost as if the mental illness provide enough constraints.<br /><br />

This was the first Elkin novel I ever read, and one that regard as (probably) his best.&nbsp; I've had an itch to write something about Elkin for a long time now, so I thought I'd revisit this to see if I still felt the magic.&nbsp; I do; very, very much so.&nbsp; I remembered much of this book but I didn't mind reading it again, especially the long monologues.&nbsp; Now I felt I could afford myself the time to savor them, though still moving through them with the propulsion they deserve.&nbsp; The final chapter, attempting to tie up loose ends, is a bit superfluous; the preceding chapter should be the end, as it's one of my favorite parts in any Elkin novel.&nbsp; The long introduction to it, describing the hotel, is like something out of <em>Life: A User's Manual</em>; the attention to detail is great and perfect for capturing the vanishing America.&nbsp; This is a novel about the eternal Southland drive in Lexington; the fading signs of franchises before the coporate sheen took over.&nbsp; It's an America that I am too young for, though I love it and deeply mourn being away from (what is left of) it.<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
It's been too long since I've spent some time with David Foster Wallace; this collection of essays makes me want to read Infinite Jest AGAIN - I am a glutton for punishment.&nbsp; Opening with the hilarious and disturbing look at the Adult Video industry, the centerpiece of the book is probably his review of an English usage manual, where he gets into the Prescriptivist vs. Descriptivist arguments about correct usage.&nbsp; For once, Wallace's style really benefits the subject, with acronyms, footnotes and Proper Nouns.&nbsp; The essay on the lobster festival turned out to be about animal rights, which certainly pleased <em>Gourmet</em> magazine who commisioned it.&nbsp; The McCain thing is also here, which I saw they're reprinting for the election season; given the current climate it was awesome to read about McCain 8 years ago, and I feared it would be really pro-McCain but it's actually about the cynicism of young voters and the bullshit of the campaign trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last essay, about a conservative talk radio host, gets a bit more experimental with the notation style but proves to be a brilliant look at the rise of conservative talk radio while splattered with Wallace's technological interests.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Baudrillard's work on my native country begins as a strange travelogue, with his reflections and contemplations about the Western landscape.&nbsp; I geared myself for something resembling Butor's <em>Mobile</em>, but then the tone shifted into a more standard Baudrillard essay style - which is to say it became flowery, dramatic, and provocative yet strangely without a center.&nbsp; Though he does get into the loneliness of New York City, the recurring image is that of the desert.&nbsp; He compares America to Europe extensively, and sees Reagan as the logical conclusion at the time.&nbsp; The invective is often very anti-American, but there's more balance than seems at first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I greatly enjoyed reading this, it does suffer from the usual problems these types of books suffer from - gross generalisations that are actually too vague to even be generalisations, and an extreme, exaggerated lens over culture's impulses (much like Virilio).&nbsp; But I'd read this again and recommend it, for 22 years later it still resonates and there are some passages of pure beauty.<div style="border-style: solid; border-color: black; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 1px; width: 460px; height: 100%; top: 0px; right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; position: fixed; background-color: white; z-index: 1000; display: none"><div style="border: 0px none ; top: 1px; width: 100%; height: 42px; position: absolute"><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px">WikipediaWictionaryChambers (UK)Google imagesGoogle defineThe Free DictionaryJoin exampleWordNetGoogleUrban DictionaryAnswers.comrhymezone.comMerriam-Webster&lt;&gt;0</div><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px; top: 22px">wvcidfjoguarm</div></div></div><br /><br />

The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914-1991<br/ >
Eric Hobsbawm<br/ >
Source: University library<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
It was about time I read something by the world's most reknowned Marxist historian, and this look at the &quot;Short Twentieth Century&quot; interested me more than his books on previous eras.&nbsp; Covering World War I through the fall of the Soviet Union, Hobsbawm looks at world trends in war, economics, science and the arts.&nbsp; Obviously he can't get into too much detail with such a large scope, but he succeeds in constructing a coherent narrative historical viewpoint.&nbsp; Thought the history is slightly Eurocentric, he shows the effects of change as they ripple through the entire world.&nbsp; For a Marxist, his viewpoint is fairly restrained; in the second half it starts to become more dominant, but he is fiercely critical of the Soviet nightmare and finds some value in capitalism's excesses.&nbsp; Actaully, what impressed me the most was his argument that socialist and capitalist systems need each other to challenge and refine themselves; written in the early 90's, this book (wisely) expresses fear at a future with nothing to keep liberal democracy and capitalism in check.&nbsp; First and foremost, Hobsbawm is a social historian, so he manages to convey the effect of actual human lives even when writing about industrialisation or war debts.&nbsp; He doesn't try to build the book around Great personalities (though Hitler, Stalin, and Gorbachev are of course unavoidable); nor does he claim distinct turning points (apart from the three main sections of the book, positioned around the end of World War II and the beginning of the economic decline of the early 1970's).&nbsp; The chapters on science and the arts were good, though they felt like they could have been excised - it was war and money that interested me the most.&nbsp; I don't know if I'll go back and seek out Hobsbawm's older historical works just because this was huge and slow going, but I'm glad I got through this.<br /><br />

I've never been able to actually penetrate Deleuze so I figured a book discussing his work might be easier.&nbsp; I think it's important to understand Deleuze to understand the 20th century - his ideas influenced so much though, and his philosophy was pretty groundbreaking.&nbsp; Reading this has still only scratched the surface for me.&nbsp; Colebrook is a clear, lucid writer and at the beginning of each section I am able to follow for a bit before I lose the plot.&nbsp; I read half of this and put it down for a month before finishing it, so I had forgotten a lot too.&nbsp; There are little things I gleamed from it that I will take with me, like the majoritarian vs. minoritarian readings of literature, the univocity of experience (though I'm not sure I completely understand that), etc.&nbsp; I will probably end up reading this again rather than attempt actual Deleuze - in fact, I don't know if I even care to read Deleuze himself.&nbsp; The section at the end with information about post-Deleuzian writers sounded really interesting, as they are taking his theories and applying them to contemporary film, politics and feminist theory - but I will probably be confusing myself more by jumping straight into that stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Taibbi manages to completely nail this particular point in American history, with a cynical-yet-progressive attitude and shitloads of humour.&nbsp; To say I loved this book would be an understatement - Taibbi probably singlehandedly justifies the continued existence of Rolling Stone magazine, and this is something I would recommend to everyone.&nbsp; I think i'm gonna go back and read his earlier book about the Kerry campaign, even if it's a bit dated.<br /><br />

I didn't finish this before it had to go back to the library (as I couldn't take it back to Helsinki) but I enjoyed the 2/3 I read - though not as much as Taibbi's other stuff.&nbsp; This is a collection of his columns from Rolling Stone which chronicle the downfall of the Republican party.&nbsp; The piece about going into New Orleans during Katrina with Sean Penn is absolutely amazing, and not even because it's funny; at some point I'd like to finish this, perhaps if I stumble across a copy again.<br /><br />

Taibbi's earlier book is a mix of his longer campaign-trail pieces from 2004 with some over-the-top satirical columns.&nbsp; His viewpoint is even more pronounced - total disgust with the electoral process and the charade of politics, etc.&nbsp; The end piece is a tournament to crown the shittiest political writer of 2004, which was funny but I skimmed most of it cause it's more for journalism nerds.<br /><br />

Lost Cosmonaut: Observations of an Anti-Tourist<br/ >
Daniel Kalder<br/ >
Source: Copacetic<br/ >
Cost: $0<br/ >
Bill floated me this weird travelogue and I read it on the plane. The author is a caustic Scotsman from Dumferline who has developed a manifesto of &quot;anti-tourism&quot; - a bit overdone really, but the book explores four forgotten republics in the Russian federation - Tatarstan, Mari El, Udmurtia and Kalmyk.&nbsp; Though his style is needless edgy, the material was good enough to carry the book.&nbsp; I can only imagine how good ths would be if it was writen by someone who actually cared about the people he was writing about.&nbsp; His intentional omissions on research and his refusal to visit rural areas and actually discover something about the people he was trying to write about definitely hindered the book.&nbsp; Despite this, I wished it was longer (perhaps because I spent 19 hours traveling home).<br /><br />

Cost: $9.95<br/ >
This 33 1/3 series is cool, and I was psyched to read an entire book about <em>Bee Thousand</em>.&nbsp; However, by the end of 160 pages I felt that it was getting pretty repetitive, despite the author turning over more than half of the book to other voices.&nbsp; Pollard himself weighs in at the beginning, and the other members of GbV are interviewed throughout though they add little to the story.&nbsp; There's a lengthy excerpt from a dead PhD student's work in progress (unless it was fake) and lots of flowery rambling about the majesty of the album.&nbsp; Now, I love this album as much as anyone else listed here - in fact, reading about it at such a level of detail has amplified my own love of it - but 160 pages is just too much.&nbsp; Some of the material in the Pollard section is quoted repeatedly, and yes, I love it, but how much do we need to say about the lyric &quot;And Christ it's a cluttered mess&quot; from &quot;Peep-hole&quot;?&nbsp; <br /><br />

Finally, a copy of <em>Mumbo Jumbo</em>, which proved surprisingly difficult to come across - nothing in any libraries, and I don't think it's actually in print.&nbsp; A shame too, because this book was completely amazing.&nbsp; The other works I've read by Reed were lighter and a bit zanier - this was still extremely comic, but preoccupied with developing a big historical conspiracy.&nbsp; He researched the hell out of it, as you can see from the copious footnotes/etc. - and the final conspiracy theory detailed at the end is absolutely overwhelming.&nbsp; This reminds me a great deal of the <em>Illuminatus</em> trilogy - both on terms of content, and in style.&nbsp; The disjointed, traveling narrative was probably very influential on Shea and Wilson; Reed actually kicks it a gear higher I think by being more focused and pointed.&nbsp; I don't know why Dalkey Archive haven't reprinted this because it's absolutely essential.<br /><br />

This collection brings together all of the stories that aren't in <em>60 </em>and <em>40 Stories</em>.&nbsp; It's great that this is finally available, as it eliminates the need to track down out-of-print collections.&nbsp; And while some of the stories in the middle of this book were less than memorable, it's still work reading every word this man ever wrote.&nbsp; A few of these were incredibly brilliant, and resembled the &quot;classics&quot; in the earlier collections - a few of these are classics of their own.&nbsp; This collection definitely tended towards the more humourous side of Barthelme, though there were some non-funny ones that were still great.&nbsp; It's hard to even pick a favorite here, but &quot;To London and Rome&quot; had me doubled over in laughter.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the non-fiction collection that I bought (though I shipped it here, so it'll be a few weeks before I get to read it).<br /><br />

Perfect from Now On: How Indie Rock Saved My Life<br/ >

Source: Kirjasto 10<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>I stumbled across this while browsing Amazon and though it might be fun, maybe the kind of book I would write.&nbsp; But it was terrible.&nbsp; The writer is a smarmy &quot;indie rock&quot; fan who actually knows extremely little about music and wears that fact with pride throughout the book.&nbsp; Everyone feels incredibly special about the experiences that music provided, especially growing up, but he seemed to think that his were somehow special.&nbsp; His anecdotes are dull, and he fills the book with footnotes, supposedly as a tribute to Nicholson Baker's <em>Mezzanine</em>, but it's just annoying to read about how he spent a whole day listening to Joy Division to commemorate Ian Curtis' death.&nbsp; I guess it's his close-minded ignorance that annoyed me the most; he talks about how he hates Dylan a ton cause his father liked it, and seems to think that his choice in music is somehow better.</p><p>Now, Pavement is probably my favorite band ever for the same sentimental reasons that he writes about, but I could at least convey my special experiences in a much more writerly manner.&nbsp; At least I think so - maybe I too would fall into the trap of thinking anyone else wants to read about this stuff.&nbsp; Really, the only interesting thing that ever happened to him is that he got to hang out with Bob Pollard a bit, and he filles the second half of the book with this. &nbsp; Of course, I kept reading - I can't deny that the part of me that still worships GbV and Pavement enjoyed reading such fanboy drivel. I should get back to Durrell now ....</p><br /><br />

Michael Pollan rules.&nbsp; This book was like a cross between the other two I've read by him.&nbsp; The opening section about the corn industry was almost upsetting - i knew how fucked the American industrial food system was, but I never knew it was quite so bad.&nbsp; Pollan is very critical, but he writes in an easy, restrained way, letting the facts make the argument.&nbsp; The middle section, on organic food, confirmed my suspicions about the organic hoopla and showed an amazing, but sadly impossible alternative.&nbsp; The section on hunting and foraging was great too -&nbsp; as a vegetarian, reading about Pollan's experience shooting a pig was fairly upsetting, and as passionate as he is about his final meal, I think the description of cleaning the pig is enough to keep me vegetarian forever.&nbsp; I think this was the best of his books and I'm gonna download that documentary about the corn industry.<br /><br />

Cost: $26.73<br/ >
The great Thomas Frank delivers another excellent attack on the conservative philosophy, this time looking broadly at the rise of the movement and offering a hopeful plan for making America into the liberal state he dreams of.&nbsp; It was weird starting this book in September, in the throws of election fever, then accidentally shipping it to Finland and not actually finishing it until now, when a major nail has been driven into the conservative movement's coffin.&nbsp; This book sort of followed the story of Jack Abramoff, but not dominantly so.&nbsp; His involvement in defending the regime of South African apartheid is interesting, but even more so was the story of direct mail marketing in the 80s, and the Saipan nightmare.&nbsp; I don't know if I'll read this a second time, so maybe I shouldn't have blown $26 on a hardback - but if there is any political write who I want to support financially, it would be Tom Frank.&nbsp; I wish there'd be a new issue of the Baffler some day ....<br /><br />

Poor People<br/ >
William T. Vollmann<br/ >
Source: Töölö library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0.5<br/ >
Vollmann's most recent book of non-fiction resembles <em>Rising Up, Rising Down</em> in that it's committed to explaining poverty through some sort of morally defensible framework.&nbsp; This is a lot shorter, however, but every bit as depressing.&nbsp; This is written in Vollmann's usual stilted journalistic style, drawn from his own experiences and punctuated with photographs of his interview subjects.&nbsp; He attempts to discover different types of poverty - systematic, political, spiritual, etc. - and in the book's strongest section, explores an incredibly fucked region of Kazakhstan that has been ravaged by a chemical plant.&nbsp; If I have any criticism, it's that maybe he spends too much time trying to compare the different people he's interviewed - comparing Chinese prostitutes in Tokyo to impoverished Thai famillies doesn't really make much of a point.&nbsp; At least he only compares them monetarily in the beginning, which is all in a table.&nbsp; Despite his &quot;simple&quot; writing style (as he claims in the final section, where he suggests [correctly, I think] that his readers are all rich), there are still some descriptive passages of stunning complexity, as strange and beautiful as anything in his novels.&nbsp; I continue to hold Vollmann as the most intense, fascinating, &quot;young&quot; living writer (since young means &quot;under 60&quot; in the literary world) and this is just another piece to further this view.<br /><br />

Tom McCarthy <br/ >
Source: Amazon secondhand<br/ >
Cost: $7.99<br/ >
This starts off with that kind of calm yet quirky approach that's really prevalent in a lot of contemoporary fiction.&nbsp; I used to associate that with the McSweeney's thing but this is British and so was the Curious Dog in the Night-Time book, so maybe that's infesting Britain as well.&nbsp; Or maybe I'm trying too hard to look for influence or blame; perhaps these writers just choose to write like this.&nbsp; Anyway, it starts off fairly on-track and slowly becomes more and more obsessive and crazy, and at some point about midway through the book it really starts to click.&nbsp; I think this book works well at creating a fantasy based around process and objects; maybe it's the most ultimately &quot;post-modern&quot; sense in that it removes the center or the purpose and creates a fiction based around the details and periphery.&nbsp; Not to say the narrator didn't have a purpose or an idea - he very much does and it is the dominating motif of the novel - but it was never completely comprehensible to me, and the ending (not to spoil it for any potential PBT readers) is perfect and appropriate. I could have probably written about this in my Master's dissertation, as there's an unexplained accident and it leads to the themes of transformation and creation (just as seen in <em>Stalker </em>and <em>Dhalgren</em> etc.).<br /><br />

In a way this is one of the 'last' PK Dick novels I'll read - there are a handful of early titles and then his non-fiction and those few hard-to-find works (like the ones he wrote with other people) and his children's book, and then all of the stories - but in the sense of the 'classic' Dick canon, meaning the brilliant run he had beginning with <em>Time Out of Joint </em>- this is the last one I haven't read, so I maybe tried to savor it.&nbsp; Actually, I read this in one sitting on a flight to Glasgow and loved every second of it.&nbsp; This is in many ways a 'typical' Dick novel, but it was an excellent example of it.&nbsp; The time-travel content was the best stuff; the novel got a bit twisted and confusing but not too much, as his best books do.&nbsp; The decayed marraige suffered by the main characters was truly painful to read, despite Dick's blunt and awkward prose - I can see that this was a man who had been married 5 times.&nbsp; I guess now it's time to move onto the stories or maybe re-read some of the ones I liked best ...<br /><br />

I took a few months off from Dick (ha, ha) and decided to go back and nail these last two just to get them off the shelf.&nbsp; <em>We Can Build You</em> is actually one of my least favorite, as it drags on with this strange civil war obsession and it uses the idea of the simulacra in the least developed of any of it's other appearances; in <em>The Simulacra</em> or <em>Do Android Dream</em>, Dick plays around much more with the question of what constitutes humanity.&nbsp; The writing about mental illness (towards the end) is the most interesting aspect, though again he handles the themes better in <em>Clans of the Alphane Moon</em> and well, just about every other one of his novels.<br /><div style="border-style: solid; border-color: black; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 1px; width: 460px; height: 100%; top: 0px; right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; position: fixed; background-color: white; z-index: 1000; display: none"><div style="border: 0px none ; top: 1px; width: 100%; height: 42px; position: absolute"><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px">WikipediaWictionaryChambers (UK)Google imagesGoogle defineThe Free DictionaryJoin exampleWordNetGoogleUrban DictionaryAnswers.comrhymezone.comMerriam-Webster&lt;&gt;0</div><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px; top: 22px">wvcidfjoguarm</div></div></div><br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
Lynda Barry is such a treasure, and this is a masterpiece.&nbsp; It's rare to find a book of comics that transcends the genre so completely - actually there is very little in here that I would even call &quot;comics&quot;, as it's really a work of art and philosophy wrapped together in a visually stimulating package.&nbsp; This book takes autobiography and uses it inspirationally; Barry suggests plans for creative work drawing from your own memories and experiences but presents her instructions, or rather her exercises, as a starting point for creating, rather than the end.&nbsp; She collages a lot of sources together but keeps them all from a similar pool, so it feels very thematically cohesive.&nbsp; The troubles of her childhood are addressed but not dwelled on - we're not supposed to feel sorry for her, but rather see how art provided a solution.&nbsp; And the questions that fill this book - questions on every page, some serious and some tossed off - make it a work that engages the reader so they are active and drawn into the book. The exercises in here, designed a bit like a children's activity book, would probably be worth trying - I intend to, actually, as I find writing and drawing difficult and could use the jumpstart.&nbsp; This is the kind of book you can go back to any time and open to a random page and have a million new ideas and directions - almost like an <em>Oblique Strategies</em> form of creative stimulus.&nbsp; I'm so glad I have this; it's probably the kind of thing I will go back to until its dogeared and tattered.<br /><div style="border-style: solid; border-color: black; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 1px; width: 460px; height: 100%; top: 0px; right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; position: fixed; background-color: white; z-index: 1000; display: none"><div style="border: 0px none ; top: 1px; width: 100%; height: 42px; position: absolute"><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px">WikipediaWictionaryChambers (UK)Google imagesGoogle defineThe Free DictionaryJoin exampleWordNetGoogleUrban DictionaryAnswers.comrhymezone.comMerriam-Webster&lt;&gt;0</div><div style="position: absolute; left: 2px; right: 0px; top: 22px">wvcidfjoguarm</div></div></div><br /><br />

This book was written in clear, concise language yet described the most brutal of domestic situations - a failing marriage and crushed dreams.&nbsp; It reminded me of Joseph Heller's <em>Something Happened</em> of course, yet not entirely focused on the male mind.&nbsp; Maybe it wasn't quite as successful because of it's clairvoyance, though it was still a great read.&nbsp; This is one of those 'classics' of the mid-centry I've always meant to read - I group it in with <em>The Moviegoer</em> in terms of style and theme, though Yates tries to comprehend detachment rather than just describing it.&nbsp; I just saw there's a Hollywood film coming out based on this, which I'm sure will be shit but I may not be able to resist the urge to see it.&nbsp; Or at least download it.<br /><br />

[Justine]: The first of these four novels amazed me with it's language - I expected this novel to be cerebral and stylistically experimental, but instead I got succinct yet beautiful descriptive prose.&nbsp; The narrative is a bit less than compelling, but I stayed with it knowing how it would complexify in the subsequent books.&nbsp; I think it reminded me of some of the DH Lawrence stuff I read in grad school, maybe because it's that pre-war British modernist vibe. but while dabbling in topics (infidelity, politics) in a way that wasn't heavy-handed.&nbsp; Curious to see where this goes... [Balthazar]: got halfway through this, forgot about it as other things came along.&nbsp; I had to return it to the library as it was overdue.&nbsp; Maybe I'll try these again in the future, as I think you really need to read all 4 to get the full impact.<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;7.99<br/ >
This book was so good I think I'll be re-reading it for a long time to come.&nbsp; <em>Lint</em> is not a parody of a Philip K Dick novel, but more like a parody of a Dick biography.&nbsp; The verbal experimentation is part Wrestling Team, part Marx Brothers, and a large part Samuel Beckett.&nbsp; The absurdity is so extreme it becomes fairly highbrow, but there's a few awful, ridiculous jokes thrown in a well.&nbsp; But it's more than just comedy - there are some amazing ideas and extensions of language present.&nbsp; The narrative was particularly enjoyable to me after reading a Dick biography because there were a lot of elements of Lint's life that are straight from Dick - the &quot;Valis&quot; trilogy appears here as the &quot;Arkwitch&quot; trilogy, and the moment of gnosis Dick experienced happens to Lint too.&nbsp; But there's no real need for knowing that to enjoy this.&nbsp; Right now I want to run out and read every other Steve Aylett book.&nbsp; I had a few some years back when I used to buy shitloads of books but I never read them and unloaded them during one of my moves.&nbsp; I'm kicking myself now.&nbsp; Amazing amazing amazing.<br /><br />

This issue of Mome has some new artists, such as John Vermilyea, who's &quot;Breakfast&quot; story is really funny and done in this action-packed, slightly confusing B&amp;W style.&nbsp; There's a recurring Tom Kazcyniski series about noise (which is okay but could have been better) and a lengthy David B. piece that is beautiful and mysterious.&nbsp; Hornschmeier's story is entertaning in that post-adolescent regret kind of way, but would have probably worked better as a comic than prose with a few illustrations.&nbsp; Another great issue though; from cover to cover, this does not disappoint because if anything is weak then the next piece usually picks up the slack!<br /><br />

This was amazingly rich in the way it destroyed the English language and rebuilt it into something bizarre and, well, Indian.&nbsp; At times the prose was so dizzying it became hard to read; the narrative was comic as well, and it conveyed a real zanyness that only India can offer.&nbsp; In some way it reminded me of Firbank, maybe through the weird linguistic constructions.&nbsp; It wasn't a total deconstruction of English though - it was actually quite readable, and it's a shame this languishes in obscurity.<br /><br />

This graphic novel is tightly plotted and perfectly paced, but I'm not sure how it sits with me.&nbsp; The ending is abrupt and I was actually shocked that there was nothing more to it, but after thinking about it for a few minutes I don't think it was necessariyl a bad thing.&nbsp; This was done entirely on a Wacom tablet, so it's kind of interesting to read a graphic novel that was created without paper, which I tend to think of as the most elemental ingredient of comics.&nbsp; Because of this digital origin, everything feels incredibly clean, though there are a few awkward moments where Modan has to include arrows or some extracurricular indicator of motion.&nbsp; Narratively, it's interesting to read something about contemporary Israeli life, specifically the way that people live with every day violence and just adapt to it.&nbsp; The constant underbelly of terrorism and conflict is felt, at least by me, and the religious aspect of Israeli life plays a role that is subdued (due to the nature of the main characters) but inescapable.&nbsp; I'm curious what else Modan will produce; this has definitely interested me in seeing more of her work.<br /><br />

Bill gave this to us as a wedding gift last year, and I just got around to starting it.&nbsp; I'm not sure why he gave us this - maybe he thought Tara would like it in some sort of warped &quot;chick lit&quot; way, I dunno.&nbsp; This is actually a fairly interesting premise for a novel - a woman is reading a biography of her sister while commenting on it throughout.&nbsp; This is another entry in the canon of twin literature; here though, theres an unreliability aspect with the narrator, and some incredibly dark sexual and psychological territory described.&nbsp; I liked the parts that delved into the psychosis of eating disorders and sexual malevolence more than the quaint stories about New England life.<br /><br />

Maybe this is more 'typical' Aylett - a fucked up, absurd detective story set in a sci-fi world where everything is impossible.&nbsp; I enjoyed this because it was quick; I preferred <em>Lint</em> which is just non-stop entertainment, while this attempted to send-up the hardboiled gumshoe genre and actually bored me a little bit with the stereotypes (even though Aylett relentlessly fucks things up).&nbsp; I enjoyed the narrative enough, especially Atom's multiple storied about his father, but I'm definitely glad it ended when it did.&nbsp; There were a few runs of language that were as fantastic as any part of <em>Lint</em>; I love how Aylett employs non-sequiturs carefully.&nbsp; The timeloop was also ace.<br /><br />

Rough Guides always put together nice books and this one is no exception.&nbsp; The first half tells the story of the Velvet Underground, pulling no punches in describing about how insanely fucked up Cale and Reed were.&nbsp; Nico, too, comes off as a fucking mess and it all serves to make Moe Tucker look like the most stable, awesome person ever (which I'm sure she is).&nbsp; The second half goes through the discography in detail, including bootlegs, side projects and solo albums.&nbsp; It's pretty funny to read about all the awful Reed/Cale solo albums all at once, though it's made me want to pull out some of my faves (like Cale's <em>Fear</em>).&nbsp; It is completely dismissive of Cale's avant/minimalist work with Conrad and Young, but to each his own, I guess.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes<br/ >
Greil Marcus<br/ >
Source: Töölö library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>I always kinda thought that this book, and Greil Marcus-like people in general (such as the whole annoying school of "Dylanologists" [which to me sounds like Dylanite + apologist]) are responsible for inflating the basement tapes into something more than just an album - into the enduring myth and symbol that they've become.&nbsp; But then I started listening to the tapes themselves, first the weird falsely-authentic official double album (with Band overdubs and stuff recorded later without Dylan) and then the various messy bootlegs (finally settling on <em>A Tree With Roots</em> as the best collection), and I too found myself drawn into an amazing world.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I've fallen victim to the myth or if all of Marcus's inflated language actually illustrates something very real and remarkable that affects me.&nbsp; This book <em>is</em> ridiculous, though maybe not as ridiculous as <em>Lipstick Traces</em>; once you get past all of his invented fictional scenarios to describe a song, there is some compelling writing about the music itself.&nbsp; I don't really know if it was necessary to compare "Tears of Rage" to a 1630 Puritan sermon by John Winthrop, but who knows, maybe that's exactly what Dylan was inspired by. The middle section of the book isn't about the basement tapes at all, but about the <em>Anthology of American Folk Music</em>, specifically Clarence Tom Ashley and Dock Boggs.&nbsp; No amount of rock-writer hyperbole can obfuscate how fascinating that music is, and I found this much more interesting than the stuff about Dylan.&nbsp; It reminded me of my favorite parts of <em>Where Dead Voices Gather </em>by Nick Tosches - the sense of mystery that these forgotten, marginalised records carry.&nbsp; For the first half of <em>Invisible Republic</em> I felt like Marcus was building up some huge concept of Americana, some ultimately false belief in some sort of mentality or truth that runs as an undercurrent to all of this music and was somehow 'perfected' in the basement tapes.&nbsp; But by the end, I think he treats this pretty sensibly - he is aware of the contradictions and dangers of this way of thinking, and how it's ultimately just identity politics in the disguise of folk music.&nbsp; Despite its flaws, I would probably consider this 'essential' reading of rock literature.</p><br /><br />

Henry Rollins<br/ >
Source: Töölö library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0.5<br/ >
<p>I had never read this before and thought it might be a good time; I had no idea what a dark, intense journal this book is.&nbsp; The beginning is great because Rollins is this wide-eyed kid, living the dream of getting asked to sing for his favorite band.&nbsp; After a few tours where they are met with non-stop violence and aggression from both the police and the audiences, he turns into the Henry Rollins we all know - the intense modern primitive who obsesses on rage, strength, and other 'heavy' topics.&nbsp; His writing throughout the book is turgid, but at least the early stuff is forgiveable because he has not yet become the <em>artiste</em> that he later becomes.&nbsp; And I admit that I found myself skimming some of the later journal entries, especially the surrealistic fantasies at the ends of some.</p>\n<p>I've never actually been the world's biggest Black Flag fan but after reading this (and the Carducci book) I feel like I really understand where they were coming from.&nbsp; Black Flag were not a punk band, and though they forever changed punk rock, punk rock also forever changed them.&nbsp; Black Flag were too radical to be part of any mere subculture, but the structure of the system they were entrenched them made it impossible for them to ignore it.&nbsp; Thus, show after show of audience members spitting and throwing cups of piss at them, while they struggled through poverty and interpersonal problems because they were trying to express themselves musically.&nbsp; There's an incredible contempt for the audience described in this book, which of course only focuses on the shitheads at these shows; still , it's hard to see Rollins and company as being too whiny when they were faced with such utter depravity every single night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hicham said to me that he though Wolf Eyes were the new Black Flag, in the way that they toured constantly, playing about 100 shows per year and inspiring kids to start similar style bands in every city.&nbsp; That's a good analogy, but Wolf Eyes never had to hide cheese sandwiches from each other, and they aren't faced with hostile audiences.&nbsp; The cultural landscape of America has changed so much since the early 1980s that there can never be a situation like this again; it's not just that multiculturalism and permissiveness have taken over, but rather the speed at which culture accelerates today creates a distance that, while not necessarily always irony, has a similar effect.</p><br /><br />

Source: American Book Centre, Spuistraat, Den Haag<br/ >
Cost: &euro;20.69<br/ >
<p>I tried to buy this book last year but I accidentally ordered volume 1, <em>Interrogating the Real</em>, which is all high level Lacan talk and far beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; This book collects Zizek's political writing, and while challenging, there are some absolutely brilliant insights here.&nbsp; A few of the essays were pretty difficult for me to follow, such as 'The Fetish of the Party' (which breaks down Stalinism through a series of equations).&nbsp; But others were fun and extremely stimulating, though occasionally repetitive.&nbsp; Because he comes from an intellectual Marxist background, there are some essays about the intellectual legacy of Marxist thought (such as the George Lukacs essay) which isn't particularly relevant to my daily life.&nbsp; There's a couple of interesting but obscure topics - a theory of Stalinism based upon a few musical films produced during the 1940's, and a defense of Laibach.&nbsp; The essays I found most intriguing were the ones that I could relate my own experiences to: 'Attempts to Escape the Logic of Capitalism', 'Multiculturalism', 'A Leftist Plea for Eurocentrism' and 'The Three Faces of Bill Gates'.&nbsp; Bill Gates represents 'frictionless capitalism' (where great amounts of money are made while playing raquetball and sitting in comfy offices, etc.) - and this has replaced actual capitalism as the perceived situation, which is actually worse because the truly violent, exploitative elements of capitalism are no longer felt. If there is a predominant theme through most of these, it's that the dialogue of left vs. right has shifted to eliminate true socialism as an option.&nbsp; The "third way" is referred to mockingly as the "post-socialist" global capitalism of Bill Clinton, the Labour party, and Francis Fukuyama; it feels like the 'second way' has never really been attempted though, as Sovietism/"really existing socialism" is a corruption.&nbsp; Now, with this worldwide economic 'crisis' in effect, I'm curious what Zizek has to say.&nbsp; His viewpoints are progressive but very rooted in ethics/morals; the essay on the current Iraq war rejects the idea that opposition to Saddam Hussein and opposition to the Us invasion have to be mutually exclusive; he actually defends Christopher Hitchens' viewpoint, which is refreshing.&nbsp; I do wish I knew more about philosophy; I fear that he may be misrepresenting Peter Singer in 'The Prospects of Radical Politics Today', so maybe I should read some Singer.&nbsp; This book also reprints an earlier version of 'Welcome to the Desert of the Real'&nbsp; (which was the first thing I ever read by Zizek and got me really interested in his ideas and style) - this version seems even more rambling than the book-length one, but is still great to read 7.5 years after 9/11.&nbsp; As with everything else I've read by Zizek, I can't say I have an overall grasp on his theoretical system (although there is a helpful glossary at the end of this book) but I intend to re-read this, of course.</p><br /><br />

Source: TaiK/Aralis library<br/ >

<p>A thin and very early Virilio book that lays down many of the ideas that follow in his later books.&nbsp; I took halfassed notes on this (found at http://static.icewhistle.com/MLitt/?p=35) but here I'll try to summarise my thoughts.&nbsp; Being written in the early 80's and largely about technology and speed, there is a certain amount of this book that is 'dated' because he's describing advances in videoscreen technology, etc which are all quite common now.&nbsp; However, the usual Virilio prescience is extremely evident, perhaps because this was written so long ago and so much of what he has predicted has come true.&nbsp; There's little ideas in here that are applicable to many of today's Internet based trends (such as the emergence of micronarratives - Virilio predicted blogging and twiter in 1984!).&nbsp; In the last chapter, 'Critical Space' (which seemed like a weird ending, as it goes off in entirely different directions from the first four chapters), Virilio talks about the decentralisation of the city - something that has certainly come to fruition since the early 80s - and how this will encourage economic deregulation and the disenfranchisement of entire populations.&nbsp; Again, it comes true with startling relevance both in his own France and in my America.&nbsp; But the majority of the book deals with what he calls 'architectonic and morphological irruptions'.&nbsp; He expands on the time-lapse/picnoleptic moment more in <em>Aesthetics of Disappearance</em> but here he's laying down the fundamental ideas about measurement, distance and perspective - how surfaces and interfaces have changed due to speed, and how tele-presence emerges as a new portal that displaces architectural windows and door.&nbsp; There are some ideas about the accident, something else he develops more. I'm really glad I read this, because I've studied a lot of Virilio but starting back with the early work gives me a better understanding of his ideas.&nbsp; I think I'm going to read a lot of his other works that I never read (or never finished reading, such as <em>Open Sky</em>) next.</p><br /><br />

<p>This is the final chapter in the Donald Barthelme story, for me - everything left over that isn't previously collected in <em>60 Stories, 40 Stories</em>, <em>Flying to America</em>, <em>Not-Knowing</em> or the novels.&nbsp; But that's not to marginalise this material, which is some of the finest that DB ever penned.&nbsp; These pieces are very short, and many are really just short stories that are labeled here as 'satires' (even though a great majority of his short stories could be classified as such).&nbsp; There's some amazingly hilarious pieces, such as his recipes using canned goods, and his deconstructions of psychology, technology and modern life are unparalleled.&nbsp; The plays, in the back, I enjoyed less, but this other version of 'Snow White' was pretty enjoyable and made me want to re-read the novel.&nbsp; I have only a few slim novels left before I will have read everything by Barthelme, but I look forward to reading everything a second or third time.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>I recently saw a list on io9.com of science-fiction writers that non-SF people/fans of "serious literature" love.&nbsp; The list was a bit condescending, implying that people who like these writers but don't read any other genre sci-fi are snobby in some way.&nbsp; I'm happy to be considered as such -- if "common" genre sci-fi reached the literary heights of Delany, Disch, or DeLillo's sci-fi, then I'd read more of it.&nbsp; Disch was of course on the list because of how "literary" he is, which I believe means he makes frequent allusions to other classic and modernist works while constructing something that is marketed towards sci-fi readers.&nbsp; This novel was pretty incredible, and I don't really know what's "sci-fi" about it except for maybe the fact that it contains a weird intelligence-increasing drug.&nbsp; It is soaked in the protest movement of the 60s and I originally took the protagonist's protestations as against Vietnam, though a later reference suggests a future heating of the Cold War against the Soviets.&nbsp; Regardless of the setting, Disch brilliantly comments on freedom and captivity through the artistic intellect. The ending of the book suddenly jumps into an accelerated voice and really surprised me, as I was setting myself up (from page 1) for a novel of unbelievable bleakness and despair.&nbsp; The dates here suggest that it took me six months to read this, but actually I started it, accidentally packed it in the overseas shipment, and then didn't go back to it until March.&nbsp; Thanks to Bill for lending this to me and to Mike Bernstein for urging me to read Disch for the past year and a half - I completely understand why he recommended it to me as a fan of Dick, as Disch is really similar to Dick from a conceptual point of view but with the added bonus of being a talented stylist and the "literary" aspect io9 somewhat mockingly mentioned.</p><br /><br />

<p>Thought not a member of the Oulipo, B&ouml;k demonstrates his talents in this slender volume, which is pretty much the most purely Oulipian book I've ever read.&nbsp; Each chapter uses only one vowel, but is also laden with additional constraints (described in the afterword) such as having to use at least 98% of the available words and contain certain themes.&nbsp; Like Perec's <em>Les Revenentes</em>, the prose becomes maddening after just a few pages, but if I can fight the urge to consume quickly and really take in the language, it's actually quite enjoyable.&nbsp; The book is ridiculously brief - 77 pages, and each one only has about a third of it with text, and even that is double-spaced - but it felt substantive enough, being that it would be fairly insane to read anything properly novel-length written like this.&nbsp; The back section of the book has some bonus material - other Oulipian experiments, like using all words in English that are only consonants and writing poetry using only the letters v, o, w, e, and l.&nbsp; The prose has the feel of language poetry anyway and it doesn't surprise me that B&ouml;k is a Canadian sound poet.</p><br /><br />

<p>My second wave of Virilio intake continues with this, probably where I should have started back when I was doing my dissertation (and i did, actually, though the book was recalled to the library right after I started it, and it didn't concern his writings on time, art and the accident as much as other texts).&nbsp; This is where "pure war" was defined - how peace, or rather deterrence, replaced war yet is a war of its own.&nbsp; Technology and speed are the culprits, unsurprisingly, and Virilio discusses the accident here though not as much as in later texts.&nbsp; These books with Lotringer are so amazing because they are so casual and conversational - I need to track down <em>Crespuscular Dawn</em> which is the third.&nbsp; This is the 2007 reprint of <em>Pure War</em>, which has two further conversations tacked on.&nbsp; One is from 1997 and discusses the end of the Cold War of course and the first WTC attack;the second is from 2007.&nbsp; Over the whole book, a ton of ideas are thrown out - more than anyone can follow - and due to the conversational nature, the topic switches a fair bit. Lotringer does a good job of organising Virilo's mind and I think I read this thinking about the exhibition I just saw at the Fondation Cartier, about population density and migration.&nbsp; One particular point that stuck out was something about how Einstein knew the atomic bomb was only the first bomb, and that the "information bomb" would follow - PV suggests a "demographic bomb" will be next , as the third bomb, and the exhibition seemed to explore that a bit.&nbsp; I went a bit nuts in Paris and bought a stack of Virilio books but I might take a break before I attempt another.</p><br /><br />

Source: Töölö library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p><em>Pilgermann</em> reminded me a bit of <em>Xavier: Renegade Angel</em> (really!) though without the humour or the stupidity of the main character.&nbsp; But Pilgermann is definitely similar in the way he roams the earth exploring questions of theology, the spirit, the body, perspective, war, and other Big Ideas.&nbsp; Hoban is such an insane writer and even though this used normal English prose, it was loaded with references to the Bible and Koran, and was generally very scholarly.&nbsp; I didn't have a lot of fun reading this but there were some interesting questions and occasionally beautiful passages, in the way that a Bosch or Brueghel painting can be beautiful.&nbsp; I can see, from this and <em>Riddley Walker</em>, that Hoban is really interested in how knowledge evolves.&nbsp; Despite the crazy medieval bleakness or the narrative, with all of its violence and maggot-infested tax collectors, this is really a classical novel in the way Pilgermann muses on all of the ideas crammed in here.&nbsp; It's too bad I don't know more about history and religion, because a lot of references went over my head and I just skimmed past them in an effort to finish this.&nbsp; For some reason this made me want to re-read <em>Dictionary of the Khazars</em>, I guess because it's set in a similar time period and also about the conflicts between Christianity, Islam and judaism.&nbsp; I'm curious to try <em>Kleinzeit</em> next, if I can find a copy around here.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;17<br/ >
<p>VERY excited that this has been translated and published.&nbsp; Go Atlas Press (once again)!&nbsp; When staying with Gael in Lyon a few years ago I came across this book on his shelf - or at least, a version similar to this - which I had never heard of before in my study of things Perec.&nbsp; This is Atlas's translation which also incorporates some other materials.&nbsp; Called "Scientific Papers of Georges Perec", this is really a collection of miscellany that is written in a mock-academic manner.&nbsp; There are some fake scientific papers, such as the titular one about throwing tomatos at opera singers.&nbsp; There is a very odd paper about the habits of butterfly migrations on a fictional island, mostly odd because it's completely believeable and just seems like a straight paper that he translated.&nbsp; The last two essays aren't really scientific in nature, but brilliant examples of the Oulipian invention.&nbsp; The last, which is the longest and cowritten with Harry Mathews, is a paper presenting a theory about Raymond Roussel that is gargantuan and surely tongue-in-cheek, but executed with precise accuracy to the point where I want it to be real.&nbsp; Overall it was a quick but brilliant read, and its motivated me to get off my ass and read <em>W</em> already (the last major Perec I haven't read). This is part of the Atlas "Eclectics and Heteroclites" series and I'd like to check out some of the other titles.</p><br /><br />

Tore Janson<br/ >
Source: Töölö library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>This pleasant blast of non-fiction is a layman's guide to historical linguistics, focusing on Indo-European languages specifically.&nbsp; Janson writes pretty straight, and is a bit repetitive.&nbsp; He goes out of his way to be politically correct, making no value judgements on any language.&nbsp; But then he makes judgements on the value of great literature, seemingly using it to validate languages somehow.&nbsp; Of course the story of language is the story of civilisation, following human development both economically and intellectually.&nbsp; The nasty aspects of colonialism and exploitation are dealt with, specifically in the chapter looking at the current dominant spread of English.&nbsp; The last chapter attempts to predict the future, with plenty of caveats about how ridiculous it is to try. Overall, it's a good book of "popular linguistics" though I think I would have liked more trivia about interesting/obscure languages.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>When I was staying in Paris, Giles had a copy of this that he had borrowed and I flipped through it a bit, thinking it seemed really interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Tara brought a copy home form the library (it caught her eye while browsing and she thought it looked interesting) so I figured that was a sign and I had to read it.&nbsp; This collection comes out of Princeton and looks at post-WWII American cultural change, generally reflecting Jameson's ideas of postmodernism, where the emphass on time and history are replaced by surface and space.&nbsp; The topics varied from intelligence testing to National Park advertising to <em>Playboy</em>'s reconceptualisation of the male interior.&nbsp; There was an underlying theme in some of these essays about trying to mechanise humanity, and I felt like these topics wouldn't be out of place in an Adam Curtis documentary.&nbsp; The article about Beat space was pretty good too, though focused really just on <em>On The Road</em> - as someone who appreciates the Beats but is slightly annoying at their canonisation, it was nice to read something that dealt with Kerouac without elevating him too much.&nbsp; The essay about plastic and Monsanto was pretty funny, as 'The House of the Future' reeks of the paleo-futurism that is rather in vogue right now on the blogs I read.&nbsp; The <em>Playboy</em> article is a real tour de force, exposing Hugh Hefner's ideas and lifestyle as the adolescent dreams that they are.&nbsp; None of these essays was particularly specialised, so it was an easy read.&nbsp; I like books that are accessibly academic (if it's a field that I don't have a background in), especially when they're curated well as this one was.</p><br /><br />

<p>It rules when I buy a book, it sits on my shelf for six years while I cart it from Pittsburgh to Kentucky to Glasgow to Helsinki, and then I finally read it in less than a day.&nbsp; And it was great.&nbsp; It's interesting to me when people who are primarily known for their poetry also write novels; I always look for hints of their poetic style.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with James Merrill's poetry but it seemed like this book was an attempt to really use prose for it's distinction in form.&nbsp; The metafictional idea - that it is the draft of a novel - is fairly commonplace to me with all of the other stuff I've read, but it was good here, as it made this novel about writing itself, a theme that I am always interested in.&nbsp; However, i think the middle section was the most interesting, when this device was mostly abandoned and a more traditional prose style took over.&nbsp; The character who lived most of his life in Greece, stumbling around a Greek restaurant in New York looking for some authenticity was very familiar and made the novel's shifting geographies resonate.</p><br /><br />

I Am Not Jackson Pollock: Stories<br/ >
John Haskell<br/ >
Source: Copacetic<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>Haskell's writing is somewhere between historical fiction and extremely speculative film reviews.&nbsp; He uses sweeping, bold sentences suggesting what a famous artist, actor or other historical figure was feeling in these miniature dramatisations, often revolving around old films.&nbsp; It's a daring approach that has some great moments, especially the title story, which dissects Pollock's dysfunctions succintly and non-judgementally.&nbsp; This type of writing can often annoy me, but i guess it's not really any different than Robert Coover writing a novel with Richard Nixon as the narrator.&nbsp; The best story is the composite of several Orson Welles characters, where the various films blend together and the supporting characters are given complex characterisations.&nbsp; It's the Welles characters who remain shadowy and mysterious, and it's an interesting balancing act.&nbsp; I don't know that I'd read anything else by Haskell in this style but presumably he's more versatile.</p><br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
<p>Delilsle's year in Burma is under quite different circumstances than his time in North Korea.&nbsp; Here, he's the house-husband while his wife works for Doctors without Borders.&nbsp; Subsequently, the book has a much more domestic tone, with the little vignettes feeling more like episodes from a life than part of any grand narrative.&nbsp; The observations are much more focused on general daily life than on portraying the situations of dictatorship, though there is a proper amount of information stuck in, generally experiential.&nbsp; <em>Pyongyang</em>, because its set in the most absurd and horrifying place on Earth, is perfect for the graphic novel form because cartoons are a natural way to describe absurd situations.&nbsp; This worked too, but with a totally different vibe, more like the autobiographical style of Kochalka or Huizenga.&nbsp; The oppressiveness of the Myanmar regime is definitely interesting, and the few parts it leaks into Delisle's life are fascinating if not scary.&nbsp; One thing that this book did was make me feel really amazed by the efforts of MSF/Doctors Without Borders (which Delisle describes plainly, without being preachy).&nbsp; I still need to read his book about China which I think I'm going to order from the library.</p><br /><br />

2666 - 3-Volume Boxed Set: A Novel<br/ >
Bolano Roberto<br/ >
Source: Brian Miles<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>Thanks Brian! I have many thoughts about this, both related to the content of the book and the external context of the work.&nbsp; The 3-volume nature of this paperback edition completely affected the way in which I read it.&nbsp; For one thing, it didn't "feel" long at all - really like three, or five, separate works that all arced with a severe velocity.&nbsp; At the end of each volume I was gripping the book excitedly, anxious to read what I could.&nbsp; Bola&ntilde;o's stylistic experimentation is quite subtle - as Caulen pointed out in a comment here, the Oscar Fate part is modeled after 'Invisible Man', and I think the last part was definitely influenced by post-war Germanic literature (at least the little bit that I've read).&nbsp; The long digressions and monologues seemed like miniaturised Thomas Bernhard novels, and of course no epic novel is complete without addressing Nazis and the Soviet Union.&nbsp; It's strange how for a novel so open-ended, I found this to be incredibly satisfying.&nbsp; It definitely has a grand scope, which is why it reminded me at times of <em>Hopeful Monsters</em>, though it was a very different novel.&nbsp; I do actually think all of the hype - and it seemed immense, given all the lit blogs I was reading in the year leading up to its publication - is quite justified.&nbsp; It's similar to <em>The Savage Detectives</em> in that Bola&ntilde;o's style is familiar (and this is actually the third book of his that I've read) but also quite different in that it took on more universal themes and was a much more 'mature' work. I'm excited now to read the mountains of blogs and online materials that I wanted to avoid until I had finished the book.</p><br /><br />

Source: Eljay's (on credit)<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>This hardback has been sitting on my shelf for years so i finally decided to read it, just so I can get rid of it.&nbsp; Coe's novel is intricately plotted and rather ambitious in its scope, yet it suffers from too many problems for me to say that I enjoyed it.&nbsp; I think it's supposed to be a satire but the anger was so pointed that it just ends up as a polemic against Thatcherism and the entire British establishment with no shade of creativity about it.&nbsp; But the biggest problem for me was the style of writing - it was obvious, at times childish, and had that simplistic quality that a lot of mainstream British fiction has (which really irritates me - also like that horrible Dr. Z novel I got at the airport, or that bad Russell Hoban novel I read).&nbsp; The insane contrivances of the plot are one thing, but forgiveabe;&nbsp; it's really when Coe writes dialogue that I wanted to put the book down.&nbsp; In the hands of a creative stylist this novel could be good, or even amazing - it has the scope of something like <em>Against the Day</em> or <em>The Recognitions</em> or <em>Infinite Jest</em>.&nbsp; The stabs at humour fall flat too; at least I tore through it quickly, compelled by some strange curiosity as to how the narrative would unfold.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;3.95<br/ >
<p>I realised midway through this book that I love Curtis White.&nbsp; I've enjoyed everything I've read by him consistently.&nbsp; I looked back over old PBT reviews and found that I wrote a lukewarm review of <em>Requiem</em>, though over time I've come to significantly upgrade my feelings for it.&nbsp; I enjoyed <em>Memoirs of My Father Watching TV</em>, though somehow it must have slipped through the PBT cracks as I read it during dissertation time (when I was trying to unwind) and its not on my original 2006 Excel spreadsheet either.&nbsp; Anyway, in my review of <em>The Middle Mind</em> I mentioned his irreverence and stated that 'I didn't think academics were supposed to do things like that'.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought that a lot during this book too which is somewhere between a collection of short stories and a novel.&nbsp; In some ways this was a very loosely organised mess, with some fantasy, satire, and personal reminiscing all vaguely about the suburban California town where White was raised, or more accurately the aura around the town.&nbsp; There were some sections that I found more compelling than others, and most were very funny.&nbsp; But there's a real literary talent evident in White's writing, one that is definitely descended from American authors who master space and voice.&nbsp; Though there isn't much dialogue, the book is very conversational, even in the extremely pomo-style bits.&nbsp; Though White is very much his own writer, there are some definite influences on display here, most notably Donald Barthelme.&nbsp; I think this has encouraged me to buy some secondhand copies of his other books and maybe re-read <em>Requiem</em>.</p><br /><br />

Donald Antrim<br/ >
Source: Copacetic<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>Antrim's turn to non-fiction is a bit surprising, as his novels are rich with dark humour and surreal, exaggerated situations. &nbsp;The darkness is certainly here, though there is not a trace of humour - it's like he decided to prove that he was a serious writer, and he succeeds greatly. &nbsp;This chronicling of his mother's dysfunctional life is complex, powerful and severe. &nbsp;The writing is succinct, surprisingly reserved, and highly emotional at the same time. &nbsp;I was reminded a lot of Franzen's autobiography while reading this, although Antrim's was much less self-centered (a difficult thing to achieve when writing about one's life) -- at times, Antrim himself seemed to disappear from the narrative, a real accomplishment given the format. &nbsp;I tore through this almost completely in one sitting, and was really impressed with some sections, particularly the way he chronicled his own developing taste for literature with adolescent eroticism. &nbsp;I think this is Antrim's best book, which is surprising, but then not really that surprising once you think about it.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>Despite Mr. Shaw's request (at the front of the book) to take a break between each of the three parts, I tore through this in one sitting, which although it is a graphic novel, was still fairly exhausting.&nbsp; Shaw's narrative is long but it's not a sweeping epic; it's localised in scope, focused on the complex dynamics of one family spending a week together.&nbsp; The comic form is perfect for this because Shaw likes to draw maps, cutaways, and use textual footnotes over his images.&nbsp; It's a style that may be annoying to some, but it wasn't overwhelming and he often let the art tell the story, especially on the sparser pages.&nbsp; Reading a huge comic - I'm not even sure how many hundreds of pages this was - is an investment so I felt qute sucked into the story.&nbsp; I couldn't help but think about Wes Anderson's work and <em>The Royal Tennenbaums</em> in particular, though there's none of the quriky, brainy humour (or really much humour at all).&nbsp; i read this like I would read a film, perhaps because of the visual nature of it or perhaps because it shares the concerns and preoccupations of a lot of filmmakers of this mileau.&nbsp; Not knowing anything about Dash Shaw (I've never seen any of his other work apart from a few pieces in MOME) I'm not sure how personal this is, but I'm not sure that matters to me.&nbsp; Because of the size of the work, he was able to really explore the other characters and make this more of an ensemble work.&nbsp; The only part that felt a bit incomplete to me was the narrative of the celebrity romance that was supposed to be some sort of metafictional comment on the main storyline (I guess).&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;14.5<br/ >
<p>I used to have this book, years ago, but I got rid of it because I found it mostly unreadable. &nbsp;Lately I've been on a bit of a Chuck Eddy kick again (I've been paging through the amazing&nbsp;<em>Stairway to Hell</em> around the house) so I grabbed this when I saw it. &nbsp;On a re-read, I really enjoyed it, as I've learned to accept his weird tastes and even enjoy his musical obsessions (Kix, Teena Marie, Def Leppard, Silver Convention, etc.). &nbsp;While a lot of these short pieces just connect pop songs that have similar lyrical themes, he really has a way to explode what might seem like a vapid song into a major thoughtform. &nbsp;There are some very bizarre inclusions (and omissions) here but again, I've come to actually enjoy that about Eddy. &nbsp;At times, the writing actually approaches a Theory of Rock Music much like Joe Carducci's (though not as focused or brilliant). &nbsp;And by the end, Eddy manages to include quite a bit about himself in these pages. &nbsp;Besides the autobiographical information scattered throughout, he also discusses his own social attitudes, giving me an image of a slightly awkward music freak who still hasn't come to terms with his inability to socialise at parties, etc. &nbsp;This was a good find and worth a straight read-through, though it will probably serve as an oddball 'reference' book from here on out.</p><br /><br />

<p>As sci-fi epics go, Dune was cool in some ways but I found parts of it really tedious. &nbsp;Most people seem to think that Philip K Dick's prose is horrible but Herbert is somehow acclaimed as a classic writer - yet I would take PKD's writing any day over this. &nbsp;I'm sure this is a great allegory about race, religion, the environment, and other things - but I didn't really focus on that. &nbsp;Most of the dialogue was actually annoying, pretty much formulaic explanations of Herbert's mythology (which is cool, don't get me wrong) and the overall narrative was pretty much devoid of suspense, as it was just a series of prophecies playingout. &nbsp;There was a lot of "sci-fi bullshit" in here - invented language, ideas and objects that I really enjoyed (as I don't use the term 'sci-fi bullshit' in a negative way' at all) but I don't know that I can bring myself to read the sequels. It will be cool to finally see the David Lynch film though.</p><br /><br />

<p>This has probably been the best Zizek work I've read to date.&nbsp; I would probably say this is the definitive Zizek, although it doesn't contain any of his writings on politics.&nbsp; The premise is that he is explaining the ideas of Lacan through Hollywood films, though in his typical fashion he doesn't adhere to his own rules -- one chapter is about a Raymond Chandler novel, and some are about non-Hollywood films. I found a few parts of this absolutely fascinating - the extra chapter at the end on 'Why is reality always multiple?' (dealing with <em>The Matrix</em>) was probably the part I understood the most, and the sections on phallophant were awesome.&nbsp; In particular I found it refreshing to hear a philosopher take on <em>The Matrix</em> by stating that most philosophers overanalyze the film, and the best way to watch it is to just enjoy it, and it actually argues that the Wachowski's vision is incomplete and inverted - a nice rebuttal to all the seers who claim its the first/ultimate 'postmodern' film.&nbsp; The book is a slow read though I stayed with it.&nbsp; Only during chapter 'Why is every act a repetition?' did I get completely lost with the philosophy, because my background isn't strong enough.&nbsp; Still, a lot of the ideas are sinking in and as usual, the writing style is so brash that I was entertained consistently.&nbsp; I had originally planned to watch a lot of the films he discusses here, like Chaplin's <em>City Lights</em> and the Rosselini films, but Zizek's explanations are good enough that I don't feel the need to actually watch them to understand his connections.&nbsp; The <em>Pervert's Guide to Cinema</em> documentary, which I've been watching alongside this, takes a similar but much more simple approach to dissecting film - however that is more concerned with basic Freudian ideas while <em>Enjoy Your Symptom</em> is much more complicated and Lacanian.</p><br /><br />

Source: Book vendor at Valley Market<br/ >
Cost: AU$7<br/ >
<p>This is Hoban's second novel, and stylistically nothing like the others that I have read, though I am figuring out that versatility is one of his traits.&nbsp; Here, Hoban has written an absurdist novel that conveys Barthelme's approach towards illustrating language's role as a signifying force with playful, detached Beckettian whimsy.&nbsp; The whole novel is very snappy.&nbsp; it moved quickly, with short chapters of just a few pages, giving it an episodic feel even though it's quite a linear narrative.&nbsp; Various conversations with inanimate objects inject a lot of humour, and there's a weird conspiracy/mystery angle that deals with the act of writing itself.&nbsp; I really, really enjoyed <em>Kleinzeit</em>, as it's the type of novel i always have fun reading and think it is a pretty good example of this type of writing.&nbsp; The heavy topics are present, but instead of being stretched out and combed through like in <em>Riddley Walker</em>, they're treated as symptoms of a maniacal world.&nbsp; Though Kleinzeit is not a character who is particularly fleshed out with human traits in a writerly way, he serves well as an absurd, allegorical character.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century<br/ >
Alex Ross<br/ >
Source: Laura Hill<br/ >
Cost: AU$0<br/ >
<p>Alex Ross's book about 20th century classical music seemed to be a general survey of the field, but by the end it emerged as a book about the fate of composition as an artform after 100 turbulent years.&nbsp; I went into this a bit skeptically, cause I've read some of his writing before and seen his blog, and I've not been too impressed.&nbsp; But I was quite taken in by the way Ross writes - he has a magnficent command of narrative non-fiction and had me enthralled by the story of Shostakovitch's struggles in a way that Vollmann failed to achieve through <em>Europe Central</em>.&nbsp; Ross is really able to describe music, and he will analyse a piece technically, saying how it moves from A-minor to C-sharp or something, but in a way that actually gave me an idea of what it sounds like without actually hearing it.&nbsp; I figured it would go downhill in the final chapters as he attempted to describe the contemporary composition landscape, but fortunately he keeps it short and takes a pretty progressive view (in my opinion) of the challenges facing the artform today.&nbsp; I never thought I would be interested in Strauss, but this book made his story quite compelling.&nbsp; World War II is of course the centerpiece, and the relationship between art and politics is explored quite actively.&nbsp; Whether he intends to or not, Ross paints a convincing argument that totalitarianism, particularly Hitler's involvement with classical music, stained the artform in a way that it never recovered.&nbsp; Though his accounts of post-war composers like Benjamin Britten, the minimalists, and Feldman are very well-written overviews, they lack the magnificence of the old masters: Stravinsky, Strauss, Sibelius, Mahler, etc.&nbsp; Of course we've had more time to canonize those composers and the world treated them differently in their time, but I think the war had something to do with it too. Compared to Kyle Gann's book on American 20th century composers, this is a lot less academic but maybe more driven by Ross's own biases, though he keeps a fairly objective appearance, at least on the surface.&nbsp; And plus, the scope of this is the entire Western classical tradition - parametes that I figured would annoy me, but since that's the scope as it was laid out when I went into it, i really enjoyed it.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Cost: &pound;3.74<br/ >
<p>I've been meaning to read something by Christine Brooke-Rose for some time, and I used to have the <em>Omnibus</em> with her four best-known novels in them, except it was lost when I moved.&nbsp; i grabbed this super cheap off eBay which turns out to be her last novel, or something like a novel.&nbsp; It is a book about death and old age, as the title would imply, but it's positioned somewhere between novel, essay, and autobiography.&nbsp; I found this to be rather hard to put down, despite being plotless and difficult.&nbsp; There's a lot of experimental forebears that I could compare it to, most notably Gaddis'<em> Agape Agape </em>but also the writing of David Markson and Joseph McElroy; a lot of the book concerns the act of fiction, and the nature of Character vs. Author.&nbsp; There are many passages about language, comparing words and forms in various European languages, but it isn't too didactic.&nbsp; Despite all of these lofty concerns, in 115 pages Life, End of manages to feel complete and self-contained.&nbsp; Obviously it's ful of underdeveloped ideas, but that just serves to make it more interesting.&nbsp; Maybe it's because there was so much "food for thought" that I found this strangely uplifting, or inspiring - instead of bleak, cynical and depressing (which, on the surface, it is).&nbsp; Brooke-Rose's writing definitely inherits a lot from the experimental masters and you can certainly tell she lived her life in France, besides the setting.&nbsp; I'm definitely going to seek out more, perhaps starting by replacing the lost <em>Omnibus</em>.</p><br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
<p>My first Toussaint novel was pretty lighthearted and I tore through it in one day.&nbsp; His writing style reminds me of early Nicholson Baker, in the way it celebrates the mundane.&nbsp; It lacks Baker's more whimsical, humourous asides (surprising too, since I thought the French did that well) in favor of a more austere, matter-of-fact style of description.&nbsp; It is definitely comic, particularly in the situations the narrators gets embroiled in, which aren't ha-ha funny but more subdued.&nbsp; The idea of television invades almost every page, though by the end I had forgotten about this supposed obsession because I was drawn into the narrator's academic struggle.&nbsp; This seems like a novel without much purpose, but the beauty is in the details, and the whole theme of television is a bit of a red herring - it's neither a critique nor a polemic, just something to base a novel around.</p><br /><br />

<p>My Dad gave me a copy of this years ago and I read some of it but lost it; the $1 copy was too good to pass up, for all I know it may have even been the same copy I lost somewhere in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Anyway, this was kind of maddening to read.&nbsp; I have a big interest in the history of the occult, and Wilson attempts to approach it fairly intelligently, but he loses the plot quickly.&nbsp; There are so many points in this book where I just wanted to throw it down in disgust at his utter lack of reasoning or logic.&nbsp; There's a fuck of a lot of research that went into this, though I wonder about some of his sources.&nbsp; There's many points where he'll describe some ridiculous magical power that someone was supposed to have any then say "Clearly, the truth of this matter is beyond dispute."&nbsp; It is?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I'm perfectly willing to dispute much, if not all of this.&nbsp; But then, I guess if I'm going to be reading the literature of the occult I'm going to have to just accept the pseudoscientific bullshit that soaks this stuff.&nbsp; And while this rendered large sections of this book annoying, the middle section about "adepts and impostors" was great.&nbsp; Reading about Cagliostro and the Comte de Saint-Germain was fascinating and I'd like to read more about these legendary magicians/con-artists.&nbsp; I have 'Mysteries', also by Wilson, on my shelf, and I have a suspicion I might enjoy it a bit more than this, so that's where I go next.</p><br /><br />

Cost: $4.98<br/ >
<p>Sunday train reading, read in one sitting.&nbsp; And what a great time it was!&nbsp; This is McGuane in a far more comic mode than <em>92 in the Shade</em> - this was so rich in the way it painted an American landscape it felt like a cross between Thomas Pynchon's best descriptions of countercultural lowlifes (particularly <em>Vineland</em>) and Stanley Elkin's panoramic view of America.&nbsp; The plot was zany, as slapstick as the best of them, but grounded in a fairly realistic scenario -- at least, there was something plausible about it all.&nbsp; Actually Charles Portis might be a better comparison.&nbsp; McGuane chooses his words wisely and manages to pack the novel with a lot of depth, capturing the America I wish still existed, down to the marrow - while keeping the novel overall short and light to read.&nbsp; I'm probably going to end up reading everything by McGuane now because this was so completely awesome that I want to devour more.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &pound;13.12<br/ >
<p>A new Pynchon book is always a cause for excitement and this was a lot of fun to read.&nbsp; It's definitely "Pynchon lite" but there's nothing wrong with accessibility; it actually shows his versatility as this captures the turning point of the hippie movement in a comic way similar to <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> but filtered through a Raymond Chandler novel.&nbsp; I wonder if Pynchon just wrote this for fun; it lacks the density of <em>Against the Day</em> and even seems to go out of the way to explain things in a way that none of his other books have, not even <em>Vineland</em>.&nbsp; It's sad to think that this may be his 'worst' book but that's in no way an indictment of it; it's great to have a beach book by Thomas Pynchon and this one slowly spirals outward into weirdness (though never committing fully).&nbsp; I wonder how much I'll re-read this - it's fun, and it's nice to revisit fun things, but there's not much to untangle whereas two years after finishing <em>Against the Day</em> I remember only glimpses of it, and I've still never finished <em>Mason and Dixon</em>.&nbsp; Plus there's a billion other unread works on my bookshelf by writers who are not named Thomas Pynchon.</p><br /><br />

<p>I generally agree with Andy's take on this; it's a bit disappointing and there's not much joy in parodying academic writing styles.&nbsp; Having been through graduate school in literature I've read many, many essays like these, though none are as entertaining since they weren't about the fictional works of Jeff Lint.&nbsp; This is a great idea for a sequel to <em>LINT</em> since a second biography wouldn't accomplish much, and there were a few completely brilliant passages.&nbsp; But if there was one line that made me laugh out loud, I would have to wait a page til there was another, as opposed to the continual genius and hilarity of the first book.&nbsp; I did like the referneces to New Weird America beginning on p.79 and running for a few pages; guess Aylett's musical taste is pretty clear.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

<p>i bought this book because Ben Marcus wrote the introduction, and read it quickly, intentionally making it last over two days to savor it's greatness.&nbsp; Before I read <em>Motorman</em>, I didn't think there was anyone who wrote anything like Marcus, but now I can see what a major influence Ohle is.&nbsp; That's not to put down Marcus's writing at all - both are absolutely fantastic writers, and two of the most imaginative I've ever read.&nbsp; Ohle reinvents everyday language in a similar manner, drawing from inevitable associations similar to the Language poets, though with a fairly strict adherance to plot.&nbsp; I would call this novel 'absurd' but that's only because 'absurd' is the best word for describing this type of fiction.&nbsp; Though I laughed a lot, it's not really funny - nor is it really about playing with form of syntax.&nbsp; There's actually no real relationship between <em>Motorman</em> and any other work of literature ever (apart from Marcus and maybe, maybe Brautigan) - it stands as a very singular entity, but remarkable not just for it's singularity.&nbsp; You can read this in a zillion ways - trying to draw some sort of concept or commentary from it --&nbsp; or just pulling images and sensations from the language.&nbsp; I am definitely going to check out Ohle's other work (though this is apparently his greatest novel).</p><br /><br />

<p>Only slightly more than five years on the shelf before I finally started this.&nbsp; I think I picked this up originally because it was recommended highly by the Complete Review website, though it was way out of print and hard to find - and I found it for a quid in Hay, so I figured why not.&nbsp; And during my many moving-related purges of cheap books I never read, this always survived the cut because I knew I'd never find it again so cheap.&nbsp; Anyway, I finally read it and I really did enjoy it, though not the first half.&nbsp; This is a very British type of satire that pulls its punches a bit; instead of painting the portrait of a world gone mad, it indulges in rambling monologues and direct addresses to the reader.&nbsp; I don't know how it pulled a rare A+ rating from the Complete Review because this felt like a superior version of that style of fiction that is popular with the British middle class (Jonathan Coe, Mark Haddon, Zadie Smith).&nbsp; I did like this and would recommend it as a quick read but I don't think it was completely brilliant, but maybe some of its subtlties were lost on me.</p><br /><br />

<p>I wanted to re-read this after seeing the movie so I put it on hold at the iibrary, where I was 86th in the queue for an English copy of it.&nbsp; Well, it finally came in and i tore through it in one sitting, remembering it strangely as a mix of the first read (from the summer I lived in Govan) and the film.&nbsp; <em>Watchmen</em> is really worth of all of its acclaim and reading it again made me realise how complete of a text it is.&nbsp; Beyond the brilliant ideas, I realised how fantastic Moore's actual writing is.&nbsp; A lot of the monologues and narration struck me as overly dramatic my first time through, but now I actually see a lot of power to it, and occasional poetry that transcends all of the limitations of the genre.&nbsp; If anything, <em>Watchmen</em> is an argument for the comic medium because Dave Gibbons' art is consistently strong in being an essential apart of the storytelling. The cold war setting is so essential to it that I can only imagine what sort of impact this must have had in the mid 80s.&nbsp; There is an incredible streak of pessimism running through <em>Watchmen</em> also, but its the most inspiring pessimism --&nbsp; the blackest darkness of outlook where the most powerful ideas can develop.&nbsp; I almost wonder if a lot of the ideas were lost on me when I read this at 24, just because my own approach to life, politics, ethics and compromise has evolved so much in the past five years.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

<p>DFW hung himself just over a year ago, and I can't believe how much I still miss him.&nbsp; Not that I ever met him, but in recent years my love of his work slowly increased til it reached the point where I considered him to be the foremoest literary voice in my world.&nbsp; The thing is, only <em>Infinite Jest</em> and <em>Brief Interviews</em> do anything for me as fiction; it's his nonfiction that really shines and creates his reputation, perhaps because it's so much easier to know him.&nbsp; I used to have a copy of this back in the day and I wanted to re-read it, so I ordered it from the library and rather quickly moved through it.&nbsp; I had forgotten how incredible his prose could be, which explodes right off the bat in his essay about being a teenage tennis prodigy.&nbsp; The famous essay on television and fiction is only slightly dated because of cultural changes that followed, though I think it's remarkably prescient.&nbsp; And the stuff at the end about how the future of fiction needs to find away around the pervasive irony portrayed by television is really spot-on -- it foreshadows the work of Wes Anderson, and of excellence in television like <em>The Wire</em> or <em>Mad Men</em> -- programs which break away from the all-encompassing Image-Fiction he talks about.&nbsp; The essay on Lynch was something I skipped before, because I hadn't seen <em>Lost Highway</em> then -- here, I found it to be probably the best analysis of David Lynch I've ever seen, with a really insightful look at his method of filmmaking (and also very entertaining to read).&nbsp; Everything in this collection is great but the crowning jewel is the title piece, the account of a week spent on a Carribean cruise ship.&nbsp; I had memories of this being completely amazing and it is, though it's sadly too short (though it's not actually short at all).&nbsp; The writing in <em>Consider the Lobster</em> seems to pick up from this point and I really fucking hope that a third volume comes out one day that collects all of his miscellaneous stuff.&nbsp; (I'm sure it will).&nbsp; Til then, I have these two books to clutch while I mourn his passing.</p><br /><br />

Source: Amazon UK<br/ >
Cost: &pound;8.74<br/ >
<p>My first foray into Stanley Crawford proved to be a pretty rewarding one.&nbsp; <em>Log of the SS the Mrs. Unguentine</em> sounds like a completely insane bit of fantastical or absurd fiction from the get-go, being that it's narrated by a woman who lives on a giant floating barge with her husband on which they have turned it into a sorta landmass and built some kind of biodome.&nbsp; But despite a few very surreal passages (such as the birth of their child), this is really a novel about a failed relationship.&nbsp; Crawford chose to only give Mrs. Unguentine's point of view here but he does a marvelous job of fleshing out her character, even given the short length and absurd setting.&nbsp; He certainly paints Mr. Unguentine to be somewhat monstrous, but the complexity of a marriage (and the true loneliness in solidarity) is fully present.&nbsp; Some of the descriptive passages were uniquely beautiful, even if they were in the middle of a section describing some errant behavior between the couple.&nbsp; I suspect that reading this again when I'm a lot older will have a pretty powerful impact on me, though even now I felt a real gravity to it.&nbsp; Which was cut with the bizarre scenario to make some weird hybrid fiction really unlike anything I've ever read before.</p><br /><br />

<p>I couldn't pass this up because it was about the economic crisis and 9/11, though it wasn't really of course (I should have known better).&nbsp; I mean, it sort of was about that but really this is Zizek's attempt to reconfigure communist thought in reaction to the events of the past 10 years.&nbsp; The timely nature of this is what interested me, plus the usual Zizekian wit and analysis (which was up to his own standards for sure).&nbsp; There's a certain pragmatism in Zizek's writing here that surprised me - even though he is critical of Obama for just being a new face on the American empire, he grudgingly admits that it is a better face and seems willing to compromise.&nbsp; The psychological aspects of Communism are investigated in the second part, looking at two different interpretations of Hegel through political thought - the Singaporean/Asian model of authoritarian capitalism and then the Haiti revolution.&nbsp; While overall slim, this was a fun read and one I would probably go back to consult for anecdotes (if not quotes).</p><br /><br />

<p>I have been waiting a long time for a book like this, so I guess it's only reasonable that I'd be disappointed.&nbsp; Actually, this was good, but I wish it was longer and more comprehensive.&nbsp; I always like Zirin's columns (even if his podcast personality is a bit annoying) but in book-length form, his writing style really suffers.&nbsp; The prose is so basic and each section so short, that I really wanted a lot more depth.&nbsp; And he quotes far too much - some quotes go on for a page or even two.&nbsp; He's definitely researched it well - there are portions where he pulls out some really obscure figures that I was fascinated to read about - but there still wasn't enough.&nbsp; This overall felt a bit like a textbook.&nbsp; The longest and most detailed section was on Muhammad Ali, which isn't surprising since Zirin had written a book about him before.&nbsp; I do like the analogy between Ali and Michael Jordan - that Jordan's refusal to use his celebrity for any sort of political purpose is a metaphor for the difference in mentality between the shallow, apathy-driven 90's and Ali's Vietnam-driven era.&nbsp; Zirin really focuses on woman and minorities throughout the book, perhaps ignoring some of the other poltical factors such as executive decisions and direct government interference (things touched on a few times for sure, but not enough).&nbsp; Maybe someone will pick up this idea and write a longer study of politics and sports; I guess the topic is as underdeveloped in journalism as it is in actuality.</p><br /><br />

Dan Graham: Rock/Music Writings<br/ >

Cost: &pound;14.8<br/ >
<p>It's really great this collection was made available (even if it mostly reprints from a mid-90s collection published by MIT press) because Dan Graham's writings on rock music defy any easy categorisation, yet are thought-provoking and actually fun.&nbsp; The earliest writings in here tend to follow a more free, experimental style (as they often accompanied art catalogs or appeared in unconventional places) and this view of classic rock, while it was happening, by one of the world's leading practitioners of conceptual art, is as jagged and biting as you'd imagine.&nbsp; The two essays about the Kinks in particular are great, because Graham is obviously struggling to justify his own enjoyment of the band through a theoretical framework, but dismantles his own arguments through fragmentation and obtuseness.&nbsp; The writings during the punk era resemble somewhat more traditional essays, though Graham has the freedom to write without any need for intellectual rigor or academic rules.&nbsp; Maybe this is actually a bad thing, but 'the End of Liberalism' and 'Punk as Propaganda' seem to really grasp Britain's changing attitude towards race and it's own crumbled empire in a way that I think few others really got during the time.&nbsp; You can file these in the same category as whatever <em>Lipstick Traces</em> goes in, except this is somewhat less pompous -- though every bit as freewheeling and anti-academic.&nbsp; Someone who takes this stuff more seriously would probably find a lot of holes to pick apart here, but I view Graham as an artist, not a writer, so I guess I'm more forgiving.&nbsp; I saw the video of <em>Rock My Religion</em> at the CCA a few years ago and I hated it because I thought it was an incoherent mess bogged down by poor-quality technical skills and intentional amateurishness/video artifacts.&nbsp; Reading the text in essay form doesn't make things any clearer, really, but at least there aren't glitchy videos in the way.&nbsp; The last long essay is about Bow Wow Wow and Malcolm McLaren's exploitation of child sexuality, which refers back to the (excellent) earlier essay about feminism and new wave, but through a much more critical lens.&nbsp; I'm not too familiar with the Bow Wow Wow saga but Graham's writing is riveting - confrontational but not too angry, pointed but readable.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;4.5<br/ >
<p>Yeah, I just read a 450-page book about salt&nbsp; And it was pretty interesting because Kurlansky really hits it out of the park in terms of scholarly effort.&nbsp; He really investigates the role that salt played throughout human history, peppering the book with recipes from the past.&nbsp; The majority of the food-based uses he described were for meat or fish, which I don't eat, so I'm not likely to try any of the recipes.&nbsp; But the segments on the role the salt embargo played in the American Civil War and French revolutions was fascination, as well as the more recent history of Tabasco sauce and Chinese cooking.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I will have the energy to tackle Kurlansky's similar book about the history of cod, but this was a really great read (though I drew it out over two months as a part-time book) and I would heartily recommend it to anyone.</p><br /><br />

<p>I tore through this in one sitting, and greatly enjoyed it.&nbsp; This is that type of popular nonfiction writing, similar in style and tone to <em>Freakonomics</em>.&nbsp; Popular science, yes, or rather popular psychology, but Gladwell's investigation of snap-decisions and quick judgements is totally fascinating.&nbsp; A few sections really floored me, like the marriage counselor who developed a system to analyse normal conversations between couples, and the therapist who measured where an autistic person's eyes looked when watching <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</em>.&nbsp; I've always enjoyed Gladwell's writing online and in <em>Times</em> articles, and I found him equally entertaining in a book-length format.&nbsp; I will probably check out his other books but I think it's time to get back to <em>Imperial</em> as my current nonfiction read....</p><br /><br />

Cost: $20<br/ >
<p>I was pretty much couch-ridden at Andy's place due to the flu, so I read this much-anticipated graphic novel that I had seen compared to Pynchon (for some reason).&nbsp; It was a bad comparison, but that's not to say the graphic novel wasn't totally stunning -- <em>Astrios Polyp</em> is one of the most remarkable achievements of long-form graphic novel I've ever read, surpassing <em>Bottomless Belly Button</em> (though I still haven't read David B.'s stuff, or <em>Blankets</em>, etc.).&nbsp; Anyway, this is the story of an architect, but it's hardly <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> -- instead it looks at love, loss, and modes of thinking, while structured around a dead twin/parallel narrative.&nbsp; Astrerios, as an architect, is obsessed with spatial relationships and <span class="formw">Mazzucchelli </span>uses the comic form to explore visual ideas that language can only hint at.&nbsp; The art is constantly shifting between bubbly, <em>Archie</em>-comics like figures to dark, tortured nightmare sequences, yet it gels.&nbsp; This is one that will sink in slowly and I'll surely have to re-read it to dwell on some of the relationships between the characters, which feel fully dimensional yet familiar stereotypes at the same time.</p><br /><br />

<p>I like Malcolm Gladwell enough after <em>Blink</em> to read another one, though these are probably best saved for airplane trips or other 'light' reading situations.&nbsp; This isn't to denigrate Gladwell - he's a perfectly good writer, who is actively trying to explore new ideas.&nbsp; There's just something a slight bit condescending about his style, as if he's writing down to me, repeating things that are obvious and trying to make sure I don't get 'lost'.&nbsp; It makes it run smoothly though, and this definitely falls into the same hybrid type of nonfiction as <em>Blink</em> was in - science, psychology, self-help and a bit of history as well. I can't say that I enjoyed this nearly as much, probably because it just wasn't as interesting, but I still tore through it pretty quickly.&nbsp; The section at the end about his grandmother was the most boring part for me, though I could tell he calculated that to have some sort of emotional/personal gravitas which is why he put it at the end.</p><br /><br />

<p>This is the first time I've ever read anything by Klosterman, whose contributions to the <em>BS Report</em> podcasts I really enjoy.&nbsp; His writing is along the same lines - "middlebrow" insights into popular culture and music, with a humorous outsider/everyman style.&nbsp; This type of writing is easy to devour and I admit that I now want to read all of his other books, though I will probably have to buy them as the library system doesn't really have them.&nbsp; While this is like an accessible, watered-down approach to cultural criticism, it's hard to fault Klosterman because he puts on no pretensions and writes with a real honesty.&nbsp; One of the interludes, consisting of 23 questions to ask a potential lover, was totally hilarious; surely the highlight of the book.&nbsp; Essays about <em>Saved by the Bell</em> and a Guns n Roses cover band are easy entertainment, but good anyway.&nbsp; Actually, I'd even say they're great.&nbsp; So what next?</p><br /><br />

<p>Checked out all non-<em>Catcher</em> Salinger books from the library after he died.&nbsp; Wasn't sure how to list this since it's only in our US-based Amazon as <em>Nine Stories</em> (which is how I last read it) except for this old OOP edition under the title I am reading it as. I forgot how great this was, which makes me excited to read <em>Franny and Zooey</em> and <em>Raise High</em> cause I have never read those before.&nbsp; As this goes along it gets a bit more ambitious.&nbsp; 'For Esm&eacute; - With Love and Squalor' is strangely autobiographical and sentimental, but still manages to work in the precocious child that every Salinger story needs.&nbsp; But the last two stories get me the most - 'Dr. Daumier-Smith's Blue Period' because it's such a straight bit of comedy -- and 'Teddy', which is just stunning.&nbsp; I really appreciate the details here - just small sentences, inflections, and especially the dialogue.&nbsp; Writing about privileged East coast people isn't something that I can usually connect with but maybe because of Salinger's influence over so much literature to come, it works for me.</p><br /><br />

<p>Here I am, again reading a Salinger book that I should have read years ago.&nbsp; This blew me away: completely, and totally.&nbsp; I am kicking myself for waiting so long to check this out.&nbsp; The prose is precisely perfect throughout; the dialogue is spot-on with only Gaddis as a peer, and the amount of ideas that Salinger is able to pack into such a short book is astounding.&nbsp; Zooey is such a stunning character, through all of his arrogance, though Franny of course dominates both stories, even though she barely speaks compared to her locquatious brother.&nbsp; Zooey's interactions with his family are brutally cruel at times, yet I somehow forgave him.&nbsp; Perhaps because his intelligence and talent shines through and it makes him so likeable; perhaps because Salinger manages to convey the complexity of family life in such a short amount of prose.&nbsp; The spiritual/Eastern aspects of the Jesus Prayer etc. could be read as the overarching theme, and Franny reaching some sort of enlightenment in unknowing, but I actually was most struck by the sorrow underneath everything.&nbsp; Zooey is a success, a talent, a force; yet his indirection and posturing perfectly captures one's early 20s.&nbsp; I'm excited to read <em>Raise High the Roof Beam</em> now.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0.5<br/ >
<p>The final foray into Salinger's <em>ouvre</em> is pretty intense, and strange when taken as one novel.&nbsp; Though narrated by the very thin stand-in for Salinger himself, <em>Raise High</em> is all fun and games (and perhaps the most enjoyable writing of Salinger's published works) while <em>Seymour</em> reminds me of <em>Agape Agape</em> by Gaddis.&nbsp; It's not quite stream-of-consciousness but it's certainly the most freewheeling and experimental work of Salinger, and it's packed with a lot to untangle.&nbsp; I would say that ultimately <em>Seymour</em> manages to be about Salinger himself, though through the guise of his fictional surrogate, though through the guise of that fictional surrogate's brother.&nbsp; If the purpose was to create a more engimatic view of Seymour Glass than to shed light, well, it succeeded.&nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Cost: &pound;32.52<br/ >
<p>It's with great pride that I finally fill in the "finished" column here, because who doesn't want to brag about reading a 1,300 page book (even if it took five months of on/off reading to get through it).&nbsp; Actually, I only read 1130 pages of <em>Imperial</em> because the last 150 pages were notes and sources, which is to be expected for such an immense piece of scholarship as this.&nbsp; <em>Imperial</em> (the book) almost defies description as much as the region called Imperial that Vollmann fanatically spent a decade researching.&nbsp; There are so many things going on with this text that it's impossible to know where to begin.&nbsp; The effort/research involved is staggering, but with Bill Vollmann being Bill Vollmann, it doesn't adhere to academic rules.&nbsp; Though he is a scrupulous historian - getitng into microhistories of obscure lettuce farmers from the 1940s (and even hiring private detectives to attempt to help reconstruct these forgotten lives), his instincts as a fiction writer take over.&nbsp; There is most notably the frequent use of poetic repetition throughout the book.&nbsp; WATER IS HERE.&nbsp; THE DESERT DISAPPEARS.&nbsp; I have never been cheated out of a dollar in my life, etc.&nbsp; But beyond that, there are over 200 chapters that vary from tightly reported economic history, to wildly personal anecdotes, to serious investigative journalism, to poetic/romantic reconstructions or even historical fiction at times.&nbsp; The sheer weight of this work is seriously astouding; even as I spent five months going through it (and with a storng familiarity with Vollmann's intensity), I was continually shocked at how crazy some of this is.&nbsp; It's amazing what he finds in this marginalised corner of California - he is able to construct analogies on so many levels it almost blows open the possibilities that this could be done elsewhere, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Most obviously, we have the exploration of America as it's defined by the edges - with Mexico's Southside looming just over the border, and the constant negotiations of identity that occur throughout the book.&nbsp; We also have a very strong theme of delineations and demarcations, as the recurring trend in the history of Imperial county (or at least Vollmann's history, which is so wide-angled it's easy to think this is complete) is the way that men have organised and defined space.&nbsp; Vollmann does it himself repeatedly, of course, though the entity he calls "Imperial" is far more than the mere county.&nbsp; The role of water as an economic false Jesus (and a poetic symbol as well) is ever-present, and the (mis-)management of this resource is a narrative that snakes through the whole thing.&nbsp; On top of all of these themes you have some wildly entertaining chapters, particularly when he places himself at the center of them.&nbsp; Vollmann rafts up the horribly polluted New River taking water samples to have analyzed for toxins; Vollmann trying to discover if there really are secret Chinese tunnels under the city of Mexicali (a 100+ page chapter that is in some ways the book's centerpiece); Vollmann outfitting himself with a hidden camera in an attempt to expose the exploitation that may or may not occur at the <em>maquiladoras</em>.&nbsp; Of course with any book that is going into this much detail, things are significantly more complicated than they might seem on the surface.</p>\n<p>I'm really, really glad I've read this.&nbsp; I've never been to Imperial, or even California, and I didn't think that this could possibly be interesting.&nbsp; Now I've found myself to be practically an expert on the topic.&nbsp; I've learned about the profit margins of the lettuce trade, Mexican border-area outlaw ballads, the business dealings that led to the Colorado River company, and a zillion other bits of arcana that probably no one has ever sought to document before.&nbsp; But beyond the mere history, Vollmann infuses everything with the quality that makes something "literature" and not mere reporting.&nbsp; There are passages of writing that are stunningly beautiful - a few that are shockingly personal, and his gift for empathy and moral clarity shines through everything.&nbsp; In short, there has probably never been a book ever quite like this and reading it was a phenomenal experience.</p><br /><br />

How German Is It = Wie Deutsch Ist Es: A Novel<br/ >

Cost: $0.59<br/ >
<p>Yeah! &nbsp;Bought this seven years ago, gave it to Andy when I left the US, took it back at New Years and finally started reading it. &nbsp;And why did I wait so long? &nbsp;<em>How German Is It</em>&nbsp;is actually a very difficult novel to assess, because it plays with so many ideas and refuses to assert a viewpoint. &nbsp;It's ambitious, and a bit crazy, for an American to write a book that attempts to dissect the essence of Germanity - especially when, as I read later, Abish had never been to Germany when he wrote it! &nbsp;But if you put aside all of the factors about his "right" to write such a thing, you do get a novel that confronts the topic of identity head-on. &nbsp;Beyond the explorations of guilt and responsibility, I was really taken with Abish's style. &nbsp;It reminds me a lot of Joseph McElroy- both in the way he structures his sentences/dialogue and the way the novel's voice continually moves. &nbsp;Additionally, it mined similar paranoid/thriller territory as <em>Lookout Cartridge</em>, and also about 2/3 of the way through the book I stopped really caring about those elements. &nbsp;This was a continually&nbsp;spiraling-out narrative - the long middle-section of the book, set in Brumholdstein, was really weird in the way that it kept expanding it's focus to new characters. &nbsp;i ultimately felt a bit confused about this book, but then the final scene was so striking and on-point, it pulled everything back into focus.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>I was at the library and browsing the music shelves when I saw this, and on a whim I checked it out thinking "it might be fun to read about Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins". &nbsp;I guess it was, though it did little to change my opinions about 90's mainstream rock music. I definitely have an opinion about Jim DeRogatis though - that he is an ego-driven fool who occasionally has insights into rock music but spends most of his time trying to stake out his own claim to cultural capital. &nbsp;There are a few great pieces in here - like the argument he has with the singer of Third Eye Blind -- but generally the writing is turgid, but trying to be edgy. &nbsp;I hated most of this music when it was happening and reading more 'insider' pieces doesn't lead to any regrets. &nbsp;I enjoyed his take on R.E.M. - several pieces which don't talk about the music at all, but instead obsess over how carefully R.E.M. controlled their own image. &nbsp;A lot of these pieces strike me as sour grapes. &nbsp;Most of the music that mattered to me in the 90s was not mentioned at all, apart from one review attacking Guided by Voices for writing too many songs. &nbsp;I still enjoyed this, though, just like I enjoyed the Metallica documentary. &nbsp;There's no end to the entertainment value of reading quotes by Courtney Love or Billy Corgan. &nbsp;These are extreme, excessive people and credit to DeRogatis for obtaining the access that he did when they were in their prime. &nbsp;It's really funny how he got fired from <em>Rolling Stone</em>&nbsp;for writing a bad review of Hootie and the Blowfish, and then includes this review here as if it was some heroic act of defiance -- when he just gave it a 2-star review.</p><br /><br />

<p>I didn't enjoy the first 100 pages of this, because Prashad begins the book by describing the many conferences of Third World nations that met throughout the 20th century. &nbsp;But as I got into the second and third parts of the book, I understood his organisational structure and realised that section 1 was the only truly upbeat material I would find. &nbsp;And even those conferences, while inspiring, are little more than words and plans, all shot down by the cruel realities of history. &nbsp;This is a people's history, which means that it does not resemble a conventional history - this does not actually describe the colonial histories of Third World nations let alone the pre-colonial. But this is successful in the way Prashad sees patterns in Third World history and maps out each chapter illustrating examples of the various pitfalls required for Third World solidarity. &nbsp;He analyzes the different types of military coups, contrasting the strong general-based authoritarian military coups (Pakistan, Chile, Indonesia) against the "colonel's coups", a military coup that does not alter the social fabric of the country (Egypt under Nassar, or Hugo Chavez). &nbsp;I also learned that OPEC originally formed as a somewhat radical leftist solidarity movement with deep ecological concerns, though that was quickly corrupted and it just became the economic cartel that it is today. &nbsp;He investigates the problems of an economy based on one product, and gets slightly philosophical when discussing border disputes between fellow Third World nations. &nbsp;Prashad knows he is preaching to the converted so he doesn't spend too much time outlying the atrocities of&nbsp;imperialism, though he certainly doesn't gloss over them. &nbsp;In his conclusions, he looks at the practical reality created by the neoliberal states against the 'darker nations', and clearly believes that we can learn from the mistakes of history. &nbsp;So while I wouldn't call this an uplifting read, there is such an empathy for these people that it actually takes on a warmth, despite the fairly academic style. &nbsp;</p><br /><br />

<p>I loved this; it's written somewhere between an academic history and a social history, and edits together shorter pieces instead of trying to establish some 'authority', which is the way music/art histories should be. &nbsp;This book almost prioritises the social history over the technical achievements, which is exactly what I wanted to read. &nbsp;The interviews which make up the second half of the book are awesome and inspiring; I felt really excited reading them - not necessarily about making sound myself again, but about the general spark of creativity that I long to feel again. &nbsp;I wrote a longer review of this on icewhistle so I'll keep this one relatively short, but I will definitely be thumbing through these interviews again.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0.5<br/ >
<p>When DFW died I put this on reserve at the library and it finally came in for me about a year and a half later, by which point I had forgotten I had even reserved it. &nbsp;But good timing, cause this was great to revisit after being transformed into an unabashed DFW fan in the intervening years. &nbsp;The centerpiece of the book, the titular stories, are amazing and were particularly good to read after having just seen the film adaptation; the writing is clearly a unique thing, but reading this made me appreciate the film more, which I never thought I'd say. &nbsp;As to the other stories - there are dazzling examples of his style everywhere, and in some places they work better than others. &nbsp;'The Depressed Person' may be the single greatest thing DFW ever wrote (at least in terms of fiction), and I also love 'Adult World' and the pop quiz 'Octet'. &nbsp;Having read a bit about his own artistic struggle, I know that Wallace was really bothered by his quirky use of language and his stylistic flourishes such as footnotes, technical language, and humorously distancing scientific-speak. &nbsp;He was really struggling to write something "real" and human, which I guess drove him to his end -- but for me, I think he was getting there. &nbsp;The pain that rings throughout 'The Depressed Person' isn't dulled by the detachment of the style - if anything, it's&nbsp;emphasised. And while 'Adult World' ends up being a totally deconstructed mess in the second part, the first part is as genuinely moving a study of sexual inadequacy/futility as you'll see anywhere. &nbsp;As always with DFW, humour is the red herring; the last brief interview, about the hippie rape, is provocative, emotionally disturbing, and strange in it's formal construction, and the only traces of humour come from the spoken style of the interviewee, which places the whole piece into an uncomfortable arena that is quite daring. &nbsp;Also - 'Forever Overhead', about the boy on the diving board, is I think one of the most bare, autobiographical bits of Wallace's fiction in his entire <em>ouvre</em>. &nbsp;I'm still counting the days til <em>The Pale King;</em>&nbsp;in the meantime, this was a good holdover, and I just grabbed a new copy of <em>Infinite Jest</em>&nbsp;(hey, it was a buy 2 get 3rd free sale and there was nothing else eligible, really!) so maybe a third read through that will fill the time....</p><br /><br />

<p>My god, I read this in two days. &nbsp;Well, I am a Simmons-nut. &nbsp;Though, reading 700 pages about a league that I don't follow would test anyone's patience - by the end I was pretty tired of his forced pop culture analogies, sexist frat-boy humour, and obsessive list-making. &nbsp;This is the William Vollmann <em>Imperial</em>&nbsp;of books about basketball, and it's an intense feeling to read 450 straight pages of Simmons listing the 96 best basketball players of all time, only to immediately follow it with long chapters ranking the best teams of all time, and then the ultimate dream team. &nbsp;And for a book based around an utterly stupid idea - that there is a 'secret' to winning, which turns out to be "teamwork" over statistics -- Simmons spends most of the book bombarding the reader with stats, which I just started glossing over after the first few pages. &nbsp;But who am I kidding? &nbsp;I loved this. &nbsp;I read it in four days and I can only dream about if he would write a book about the NFL (or if there was a similar book about hockey or English football by someone with the same level of knowledge and passion as BS has for the NBA). &nbsp;I guess that's what comes down to it - Simmons really does love the NBA, probably more than anybody, and it really shows here. &nbsp;And I can now say I know a million times more about the league than I did last week - and I'll be curious to check out ESPN Classic now, especially to read about some of the names that I've now familiarised myself with.</p><br /><br />

<p>The long wait for new Clowes material has come to an end, but sadly, <em>Wilson</em>&nbsp;was devoured in one exciting session, and now I guess it will be a few more years til we see something else. &nbsp;This proceeds stylistically from the last few <em>Eightball</em>s, though without quite as much of a spiderweb narrative, instead focusing on one character and storyline. &nbsp;Clowes sticks to a rigid, single page format for each episode, with a punchline in the last panel of every page, a technique that is hilarious and brilliant in its rhythm. &nbsp;Of course, this isn't a pleasant tale, and Wilson is barely evolved from most of Clowes' fucked up, socially repressed characters. &nbsp;His arrogance and negativity shines through everything, even his moments of utter vulnerability, and this is the misanthropic streak that I love about Clowes. &nbsp;The colour palette is beautifully chosen; some episodes are drawn in different styles, much like the <em>Ice Haven</em>&nbsp;book, which makes it feel strangely cinematic. &nbsp;I think this has been criticised for being somewhat of an emotional flatliner, but I think that's exactly why I loved it. &nbsp;</p><br /><br />

<p>I wrote a longer review of this and then wiped it; my thoughts are bit disjointed, probably cause I read half of the book, put it down for two weeks while I was away, and then returned to it. &nbsp;But, I loved <em>I'm Not Stiller</em>. &nbsp;It continually shifted and confounded my expectations -- I went into it thinking it was gonna be like <em>Camp Concentration</em>&nbsp;or Kafka's <em>Trial</em>, but then it shifted gears a lot. &nbsp;A lot. &nbsp;You can formally assess this as a brilliant study of identity, or a celebration of fiction and storytelling. &nbsp;It was not nearly as dystopian as I expected -- in fact, it celebrated the everyday through the long domestic passages. &nbsp;This is a work about reinvention and confronting one's past, and the construct of the narrative kept things fresh. &nbsp;The tone shifts completely in the final coda (part two), which is understandable as there is a different narrator. &nbsp;But it's almost shocking in how different it becomes, and I was left slightly stunned and thinking I should read the rest of Frisch's work.</p><br /><br />

Fernando Pessoa<br/ >

Cost: &euro;10<br/ >
<p>This is a very slim Pessoa piece that works as a natural companion to <em>The Book of Disquiet</em>. &nbsp;Although the text itself is really only about 35 pages (filled out with some appendices of all other known writings by Pessoa's Baron of Teive heteronym), it's quite satisfying, because like <em>Disquiet</em>&nbsp;you can linger on every little passage. &nbsp;This is again a book about uncertainty, but Teive has resigned himself to suicide and reflects on the dangers of committing to any position. &nbsp;I would say it's the most ambivalent book I've ever read but I'd probably still save that for <em>Disquiet</em>; but thinking again about how consciousness and identities are not so much fragmenting but multiplying, Pessoa now seems to me like possibly the most contemporary writer imaginable (and he died in 1935!). &nbsp;Although a good chunk of this was wrapped up in his dissection of three poets and their sexual problems (none of whom I read), this still had some amazing passages. &nbsp;And while seeming on the surface like it would be depressing, it's really not. &nbsp;Pessoa is so amazing because he really wrote fiction from the inside-out (for lack of a better term) - there is no narrative, and nothing happens, but the fiction is in the thoughts and the construction of the author. &nbsp;</p><br /><br />

Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History<br/ >
David Aaronovitch<br/ >
Source: Waterstone's, Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow<br/ >
Cost: &pound;0<br/ >
<p>Aaronovitch's book looked compelling, but it turned out to be little more than the standard skeptical rebuttal of the world's most popular conspiracy theories. &nbsp;It certainly began in a promising way, with <em>Protocols of Zion</em>&nbsp;and an alleged anti-Stalinist conspiracy, and I thought the book would actually explore what it's subtitle promised. &nbsp;But the rest of the book, dealing with the <em>DaVinci Code</em> crap, JFK, 9/11, Whitewater, the Kelly affair and the Birthers, was just the standard intelligent dismissal of these theories -- but not in enough depth to be truly entertaining. &nbsp;At the end of the book, Aaronovitch finally starts to establish a social theory of conspiracy theories - basically, that humans inherently look for narratives and conspiracy theory emerges from those who have suffered political and social defeats and feel like they have no efficacy. &nbsp;Which is all well and good, but maybe the subtitle should have been "How human natures shapes conspiracy theory" instead.</p><br /><br />

<p>I grabbed this at a really good, cheap bookstore in Leeds a few years ago but never sat down and read it. &nbsp;I was familiar with a lot of the monologues before, but after the workshop in Mooste with Giles, where we showed the beginning of <em>Swimming to Cambodia</em>, I felt like reading this. &nbsp;The written version of it is significantly longer than what's in the film, and that's only about 15% of the book, which is filled out with some other (excellent) monologues. &nbsp;There's something a bit odd about reading these monologues which are clearly meant to be performed - it means Gray the writer has an obviously conversational style which doesn't always translate perfectly to the page. &nbsp;But the rhythm is undeniable, and I can't help but hear the words booming out in his voice. &nbsp;'47 Beds' was maybe my favourite piece here - I'd love to hear/see the performed version of it. &nbsp;'Terrors of Pleasure' and "Sex and Death' I had heard before, though reading them took me back to high school when I read a lot of humorous, first-person narratives like this (though I can't really think of any examples right now). &nbsp;I think this is motivation to rewatch all of the films now, though finding the time for that might be difficult.</p><br /><br />

Rock and the Pop Narcotic: Testament for the Electric Church<br/ >
Joe Carducci<br/ >
Source: already owned<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
<p>I was itching to re-read this after using a short section from Chapter 1 in the seminar I organised in Tampere. &nbsp;It's been a few years but time has been kind to my memory of Carducci's treatise on rock music. &nbsp;But not kind enough -- this really blew me away the second time through. &nbsp;I think the first reading was partially about dealing with his politics, and now that I approached it for the ideas I had no problem putting my disagreements aside and just thinking about the points he was making. &nbsp;What's so amazing about this book is that it's a brilliant look at the actual musical elements of rock, but also a brilliant look at the culture surrounding rock. It may feel at times like his 'Narcorockcritocracy' chapter is just petty insider whining, but actually Carducci makes a pretty compelling argument that everyone has basically gotten it wrong. &nbsp;He cares so much about the critics because they have created the structure of the rock world which negatively impacts the music, through the effects of the pop narcotic. &nbsp;Carduci's taste is really distinct but impossible to pin down and really fascinating at the same time. &nbsp;The 'Psychozoic Hymnal' section is pretty astounding, for the sheer number of potential bands to investigate - and his part on the early 90s is probably the most confounding. &nbsp;I was trying to think about how things have changed since this was written (around '94) and I'm not really sure what to think - I'm not sure how accurate my own interpretation of the rock press would be since I haven't read <em>Rolling Stone</em>&nbsp;since high school. &nbsp;Anyway, I still say this is the best book about rock music ever written; Adam Strohm NEEDS to read this. &nbsp;Doug, you probably already have, but if not, then get a copy. &nbsp;And Jim Laakso would probably flip out over this too if he hasn't already read it....</p><br /><br />

Cost: $13.94<br/ >
<p>It took me forever to read <em>Darconville's Cat</em>, which is forgiveable because I've had no time for reading and it's 700 pages long. &nbsp;But I also got pretty unmotivated for large parts in the middle of this book. &nbsp;My first tendency is to say it would have been better at half the length, but then the bloat is the whole point. &nbsp;This is as densely erudite as anything I've read by Gaddis or other masters; it didn't take me long to start letting the reference bounce off me because it was too overwhelming. &nbsp;You could spend a lifetime annotating this, or creating a concordance of it. &nbsp;The plot wasn't anything special; this is a book to savour the actual writing. &nbsp;Theroux is quite funny and the early parts of the book made me think the entire thing was going to be a somewhat juvenile mockery of Southern culture and the types of shitty liberal arts colleges that this was set in. &nbsp;It gets wrapped up in its own melodrama, and then the insane Dr. Crucifer enters and things take on a quite different tack. &nbsp;I wish I didn't find so many of those long chapters tedious but it was hard not to skim -- yet they are also the best parts. &nbsp;This is an incredibly dark and misanthropic book that I'm sure pretty much autobiographical - the moral question of a professor boffing one of his students is skirted, no doubt for Theroux to cover his own ass; it then comes down to a thin excuse on which to hang inventive wordplay and ridiculousness. &nbsp;Right near the end there's a chapter that is about twenty pages of ways to infict harm upon a woman, and it actually outdid Sorrentino at listmaking brilliance. &nbsp;By my own self-defined rules of the bookshelf this is gonna travel around with me forever, since it's good enough to warrant a re-read or at least referencing, and it's sadly way out of print.</p><br /><br />

<p>Again, Wheen delivers an enjoyable book that managed to be a popular history without being too introductory or repetitive. &nbsp;<em>Strange Days Indeed</em>&nbsp;specifically recaps the 1970s and the way paranoia seeped into politics and popular culture. &nbsp;Though written obviously in hindsight, Wheen steers clear of huge sweeping pronouncements apart from his frequent assessments of Richard Nixon's personality. &nbsp;I particularly enjoyed how he balanced Nixon's mental unraveling with Harold Wilson's Britain, and cited a lot of behaviours that were similar without making any grand claims. &nbsp;Most of these chapters left me wanting more, which isn't something I can say often. &nbsp;I liked <em>How Mumbo-Jumbo...</em>&nbsp;a lot too, but that got bogged down in its own rants against pseudoscience - freed from that polemic, <em>Strange Days Indeed</em>&nbsp;was an overall stronger book, I think.</p><br /><br />

Cost: &euro;15.5<br/ >
<p>It will sound pretentious but whenever saying the title of this book I should really pronounce it as "dew-bluh-vay", because that's the French W, which is a double V and not a double U. &nbsp;It's important here because this is a book about a double vie, two lives, or rather two memories intertwined chapter by chapter. &nbsp;I was so obsessed with Perec for years, and even was intending to do a PhD at one point about him, yet somehow I never read this, which is probably his greatest book! &nbsp;It's the most straight-forward and beautiful of his works, a memory of childhood in wartime, yet with the war distant, even absent. &nbsp;Perec's retelling of his youth is more about memory itself than the experiences of growing up a displaced Jew in wartime Paris. &nbsp;He uses the form of the story to tease out different approaches to recollection, uncertainty, etc., particularly when reprinting a passage he wrote about his parents 15 years previously, with annotations and corrections. &nbsp;The fantasy of W, set in parallel italics, is strangely childlike (with it's bureaucratic sports obsessions) yet dystopian. &nbsp;It falls apart from the initial setup (of the mysterious stranger in the bar) and just becomes an elaborate fantasy that is all structure, no heart; it's not what I loved about <em>W</em>, but yet it's an essential component.</p><br /><br />

<p>Bryson nails it again, this time writing a history of the world from the perspective of his house. &nbsp;It's good, not as good as <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em>&nbsp;(or whatever that was called), but done in that great Bryson style -- which manages to make anything, absolutely anything, interesting to the point of being fascinating. &nbsp;The humour is almost nonexistent here but thats OK, because I'm too busy learning about staircase accidents, the life of 19th century London chimney sweeps and the history of canned goods. &nbsp;I can't help but compare this to James Burke's best work, though minus the probing, questioning insight about change and fear. &nbsp;But nothing will ever live up to those standards, so it's best to enjoy <em>At Home</em>&nbsp;for what it is. &nbsp;The structuring device of his household is a bit misleading, because he really just uses each room as a loose starting point to riff about whatever he is interested in -- there's sometimes a direct relationship and other times it feels like a very tenuous connection. &nbsp;But everything in here is researched to death, almost staggeringly so for a work of popular scholarship. &nbsp;</p><br /><br />

<p>When I said goodbye to Nick back in July he gave me this Bryson paperback just because he didn't want to take it with him. &nbsp;I haven't read this since probably high school so it was fun to revisit, especially after living in Europe myself for the past 5 years. &nbsp;Reading this right after serious, mature Bryson made it feel like a real release. &nbsp;His humour so relies on stereotypes that it would be easy to take it as racist, except everything is cast so ridiculously that it has a gentle edge. &nbsp;Or maybe I just like him. &nbsp;It's particularly interesting to read about Europe in 1990, with different currencies, Yugoslavia, and the need for visas -- all concepts which I have never dealt with much or at all. &nbsp;Bryson is hilarious but not actually a great travel writer -- he has some insights, for sure, but also mostly writes about the restaurants he goes to and his annoyances on trains and in hotels. &nbsp;The account of Sofia is fascinating and he's not afraid to say that in some places he just didn't really feel like doing anything (such as Istanbul) which I guess is a more realistic approach to travel writing. &nbsp;I'll read this again in ten or fifteen years probably.</p><br /><br />

<p>Klosterman is so great. &nbsp;I ripped through this in one sitting and I wish it was ten times longer. &nbsp;The essay about American football is amazing, and one of the most unique looks at the game ever. &nbsp;There's also great writing about ABBA, Weezer, Werner Herzog, Nirvana, Pepsi, and Garth Brooks. &nbsp;This didn't have the extreme hilarity of <em>Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs</em>&nbsp;and a few of the pieces felt half-assed, but even a half-assed Klosterman is pretty brilliant.</p><br /><br />

Freedom<br/ >
Jonathan Franzen<br/ >
Source: Vallila library<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0.5<br/ >
<p>Sitting down to review <em>Freedom</em> feels almost as daunting as it must have been for Jonathan Franzen to write it. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t even imagine the immense pressure on him, after the smash success (and fallout) of <em>The Corrections</em>; the heat is on him to be THE great American novelist, this generation&rsquo;s Mailer, etc. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s actually the most interesting aspect of <em>Freedom</em> is this pressure - and the inevitable disappointment that must come when it&rsquo;s finally produced nearly a decade after his masterpiece. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s purely external factors, then, that led to my enjoyment of this, though there are some excellent moments throughout. &nbsp;It starts off with a bang - the book is structured very symmetrically, with opening and closing sections written largely from the POV of minor neighbour characters, and the opening chapter is really dazzling. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s when Franzen begins to sink into the meat of the story that I started to find fault with <em>Freedom</em>. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s clear that Franzen is trying to tackle everything here - the scope is immense, and though the narrative focuses on one family, Franzen tries to paint a definitive portrait of the past decade in American life. &nbsp;His attempts to merge the political machinations of the Bush era with the midwestern family who are the subject of this novel are clumsy and forced. &nbsp;He simultaneously tries to portray the moral decay of America during the 00s while navigating the complex compromises that are unavoidable as a participant in late Capitalism, and it doesn&rsquo;t come off even half as deft as, say, <em>Arrested Development</em>. &nbsp;Actually, <em>Arrested Developmen</em>t, though a comedy TV series, is like a far better version of <em>Freedom.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Franzen himself (who I have a lot of sympathies with, as I [and pretty much only I] loved his autobiography) spends far too many inches trying to justify his own displacement from popular culture. &nbsp; Writing a Bright Eyes concert into a novel is a way to comment on his own age, and feeling out of touch; even more glaring are the several times characters comment on the change in communications with texting, mobile phones, Twitter, etc compared to the older generation. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost like he tried to inject his messy diary entries into a grandiose novel, but instead of widening the scope it just comes off as awkward. &nbsp;Which brings up the dialogue &mdash; <em>Franzen</em> is a well-known critic of William Gaddis, but he could learn a few things about the human voice by reading Gaddis. &nbsp;The conversations in <em>Freedom</em> are horribly awkward, forced, phony, bland and boring. &nbsp;So while I definitely enjoyed reading this - some parts of the story had me genuinely engaged - the most interesting aspect to me was how much of Franzen himself was laid bare, though clearly hiding behind things. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a writer who is terrified of his responsibility, trying to come to terms with his own aging and his own moral conflicts. &nbsp;<em>The Corrections</em> is a great book because it was hilarious and miserable at the same time; this book hits neither highs or lows, almost like it&rsquo;s trapped in a self-medicated band of normalcy. &nbsp;But, does the great American novel have to be about the emotional sufferings of affluent white people? &nbsp;I certainly appreciate that in the work of someone like Wes Anderson, and I did love <em>The Corrections</em>, but here I found myself unable to be interested in any of the characters, almost like they were portrayed so realistically they became boring. &nbsp;Gross, exaggerated caricatures may be easier but they&rsquo;re also more enjoyable to the reader. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not Franzen&rsquo;s fault he has been successful, and I think with his last book, it was deserved &mdash; but I wonder how much better this had been if he had hid behind a psuedonym.</p><br /><br />

A Smugglers Bible<br/ >
Joseph McElroy<br/ >
Source: already owned<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
And finally, at 9:46 AM on the 23rd of March 2011, I finish reading a book for the first time in 2011.  You who have me (to use a McElroyesque turn of phrase) will know that I used to be quite an active reader, but lately I'm starting to resemble an active collector of books instead.  This is not the place to offer excuses about why I don't have the time or inclination to read as voraciously as I used to, but rather the place to enter my comments on <i>A Smuggler's Bible</i>, reading #2.  The first time I read this was probably about ten years ago, which is scary - the pre-PBT era, when I was buying up recommendations from  Internet mailing lists, using half.com to the point of obsession.  For the past decade I've considered McElroy one of my favourite writers, but I'm not sure exactly why.  I haven't read all of  his work, and some of his texts are so incredibly challenging that I'm not sure what I actually get out of them.  2011 seemed like a logical place to re-evaluate, especially as I've trucked my shitload of books to yet another country (see attached photo -- and there's a whole other shelf not pictured).  I've justified dragging around so many obscurities for just that reason - obscurity - claiming that it's not easy to walk into a library or bookstore and replace, say, <i>Lookout Cartridge</i> (especially in Estonia).  But if my list of "can't live without-faves" is now so vast as to include the complete works of McElroy, Mathews, Perec, and others, I really have to continually engage with these texts to justify such an un-zen existence.  Watching all the Godard films in order gave me a passion for this chronological approach, so why not take McElroy down the same path?  This allows me to finally read <i>Hind's Kidnap</i>, re-read the others (especially <i>Plus), </i>and hopefully finish <i>Women and Men </i>this time - and as a treat, I get his new collection of short fiction at the end.<div>So, <i>A Smuggler's Bible</i>.  My memory was that this was one of the more 'accessible' of McElroy's texts and I guess this is true, though I don't know how that actually matters.  In some ways, the framing of this "story" is merely an excuse for JMcE to dive into various styles and voices and explore semi-autobiographical territory while hanging it around a vaguely ambigious, mysterious plot.  Or is there a plot?  Like <i>Lookout Cartridge</i>, such elements are distracting and irrelevant yet provide a compulsion to keep going.  There are clues that don't add up, but that's not the point.  If there is a point, it's the exploration of consciousness, and the complex depiction of David Brooke through his constructed memories of others in his life - a way of writing around an actual subject.  Pure literary impressionism, right?  Because McElroy isn't an absurdist and has almost no comic traces, he doesn't seem to fit with the other big names of postmodern American literature (Barth, Pynchon, Coover, etc.); his books are every bit as laced with Gaddis-like erudition, but it's woven so cohesively into the text that it doesn't feel like namedropping or referencing.  Though published in '66, this is a novel set in the early 60's, mostly around 1960, so I found myself imagining this juxtaposed in the world of <i>Mad Men</i>, which was kinda useless as a mental device since David Brooke's world is about as far away from Don Draper's as possible.  The first time I read this I left with the sense that I was missing something, narrative-wise; this time I let the words flow over me, but because I dragged out the reading of this over 2.5 months (mostly in little bursts on the ferry or whatever) I wasn't able to completely immerse myself the way I wanted to.  The final section, written as Brooke's father Halsey, was incredible - as unique and beautiful as anything I have ever read.  McElroy is such a masterful stylist, though his style isn't flashy - it's a slow burner, that reaches a beautiful climax here.  I love writing that can be strange and evocative, which this is, but it does so in such a focused way that it's strangeness doesn't even feel strange.  I think I finished <i>A Smugger's Bible</i> reading #2 feeling like I can definitely justify carrying this battered paperback around for another ten years at least (this is the same edition I read the first time, and the pages are starting to fall out and the back cover is hanging on by just a few threads).</div><br /><br />

Good ol' Nicholson Baker.  There's something reliable about his books, even though he likes to take chances and write differently.  <i>The Anthologist</i> falls into the <i>Mezzanine</i>/<i>Box of Matches</i> style of his books, where the novel exists entirely in the narrator's home.  And by home, I mean head.  <i>The Anthologist</i>'s narrator, poet Paul Chowder, is no more or less Bakerian than any of his other narrators.  This novel is a book about poetry, in some ways the <i>Poetry for Dummies</i> mentioned near the end.  Throughout his everyday procrastinations, Chowder explains his passion for four-beat metre, looks at different rhythms in classic poems, and celebrates his favourite writers.  Chowder's tastes are different than mine so I found some new names to possibly investigate (though I don't know if I actually will) and I loved every page of this.  The 'plot', besides the procrastination, involved Chowder's girlfriend and his longing for them to get back together.  This pain was felt throughout the book, but never overly discussed - just mentioned enough to convey a proper lingering emotion.  Baker, you've done it again!<br /><br />

Cost: $23.62<br/ >
Price includes shipping + customs fees.  I loved this; after receiving this big Amazon stash, it was the first thing I went for and I actually wanted to steal myself away from the events I organised in Helsinki last weekend to read more of this.  At around 200 pages, this is a much shorter read than Simmons book, but in many ways it was far better.  Certainly, the quality of the writing was better - the FreeDarko collective is a group of truly brilliant basketball fans, and while Simmons has just as much passion for the history of pro basketball, this book is better because it has multiple perspectives and far more intelligence behind it.  The graphics and statistics are brilliantly put together, and quite innovatively designed - they're so snappy that it's easy to ignore the insane level of statistical research that went into this (the graphic showing every fight in an NBA game is particularly mesmerising).  I've become way more interested in pro basketball over the past season (since it's been an awesome, fascinating year) so this game at a good time for me -- and I'll definitely read it again.<br /><br />

Cost: $19.9<br/ >
This is maybe the most I've ever anticipated a book.  A shame I probably won't get to crack it for at least a week. [14 April 2011]<div><br/>It's been almost three years since DFW took his own life, and in the intervening time he's grown in stature to my own mind, where I not only consider him to be the most important writer of my time, but <i>The Pale King </i>is the most I've ever anticipated any work.  With this anticipation comes expectation, which I didn't want to have, so I then tried to overcompensate by lowering my hopes and figuring that in an unfinished state, how good can it be? After now reading it, I understand why it took so long to assemble, and of course I'm left longing for more which is inevitable (<i>Infinite Jest</i> had the same effect on me, and it was twice as long and finished).  Of course I loved it, but it is frustrating that it's only 500 pages - so many characters are started, trajectories plotted, and then nothing.  I don't want resolutions - I know enough about his style to expect that - just more meat and flavour!</div><div><br/></div><div>There's an article about DFW that ran in either the New Yorker or New York Times over a year ago which looked at what he was going through in the years leading up to his suicide.  I think that's really the key to his whole work; I'm going to re-read it now, but I remember specifically that he struggled with his own writing, which he felt wasn't actually connecting to anyone and conveying anything human.  I think that hung over me the whole time I was reading this, because I really perceived this as a much more emotionally connecting work than <i>IJ</i>, without compromising DFW's style, love of jargon, bizarre narrative structures, and discordant voices.  The long first-person narrative from 'Irrelevant' Chris Fogle , set as the centerpiece of the book, is substantial enough to be its own novella and in some ways the heart and soul of this book.  There are long conversations (particularly the exchange between Meredith Rand and the neutral, emotionless GS-9 at the end of the book) which aren't concerned with literary tricks or humour - and actually try to explore human relationships and a sense of identity.  The biggest thing for me is that <i>The Pale King</i>, which is about boredom, is not nearly as bleak or pessimistic as <i>IJ</i> (though I should say that the first time I read <i>IJ</i> I wasn't affected by its pain and desolation, and on a second reading I realised it was the saddest book I ever read - so maybe that will happen here too).  But as his notes, appended to the book to hint at where the novel might have one, indiciate - DFW wanted to find a bliss that comes through boredom.  So I think there's actually something hopeful about it.</div><div><br/>Of course, one problem is that he can make anything seem interesting, and the nuances of the IRS office structures, tax codes, and other bureaucratic structures are completely wonderful to get lost in.  Being set in the 1980s forced him into a more realistic timeframe, though he still manages to work in ghosts and psychics; his own authorial presence has actual value instead of merely being metafictional gimmickry, and those chapters are the most entertaining in the classic footnoted style that I've come to love.  </div><div><br/>I've had some bleak times myself lately but I can't even pretend to understand what he was going through, and <i>Infinite Jest</i> must have been fairly cathartic, to chronicle such despair and devastation in such a grandiose way.  <i>The Pale King</i> is definitely coming from the same place, but also carries the pressure of success in the same way Jonathan Franzen's last book did.  While this is a far better (and more interesting) work, I wonder if his own self-imposed and quite stringent writing standards possibly made his situation worse.  This is a stupid thing for me to speculate about, but it's impossible to read a book by a recently-suicided writer, especially if he's your favourite writer, without wondering about such things.  </div><div><br/>I can't help but be sad and even a little angry at DFW for choosing to do what he did, and not finishing this - were he still with us, we could have at least 30+ more years of his genius.  I realise how hideous and selfish this sounds.  </div><br /><br />

Stewart Lee<br/ >
Source: Lewis<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Lewis loaned me this given my recent surge of interest in standup comedy, and it really hit the spot.  I wasn't particularly familiar with Stewart Lee but after reading this I have to call myself a big fan.  This is basically the transcripts of three of his sets, with lots of annotations and interstitial chapters explaining his inspirations and experiences in the world of British standup comedy.  Standup doesn't translate well to paper, but Lee realises this and really it's the footnotes that make this, though it make this take far longer to read than it should have.  Lee is very pointed about social issues and has figured out a real place for himself in comedy, but he also has amazing taste in experimental music so there's frequent comparisons that are pretty great, such as "the Mighty Boosh are like Sunny Murray's drumming on those early Albert Ayler records", and there's also an appendix about Derek Bailey.  I don't know most of the comedians that he's friends with and/or inspired by, but that doesn't matter so much; what was really great was the way he would go into deep analyses about different jokes, and things he would do live to respond to the audience.  If I was going to attempt my own standup set (which has crossed my mind, in a low-pressure open-mic kind of way) then this is more or less a manual on how to do it.<br /><br />

I was looking back over my PBT and realised that I never logged this, which I read mostly on the train from NYC to the Adirondacks. Paglen's book was primarily an attack on Pentagon secrecy, with a paperback-edition afterword that blasted the Obama administration for failing to achieve the transparency they campaigned on. This wasn't Area 51 conspiracy stuff but looked specifically at testing sites that were officially denied for years and the types of military testing that goes on. In it's most grandiose moments it got into postmodern spacial theory and psychogeography but really only as a dusting. I think Rich pell is friends with Trevor Paglen. I liked this but wasn't blown away; I think I left it with Brian, or maybe with my father.<br /><br />

I found this on the clearance rack and since I am so interested in comedy right now (and always had a ton of respect for Steve Martin), this was a fun read.  I was glad to discover a work that was extremely honest, as Martin's standup personality wasn't that at all.  The origin of his comedy was described quite literally as an epiphany while writing for the Smothers Brothers, and his explanation of the idea of anti-comedy is completely spelled out and articulated.  The most fascinating parts of this was the stuff about his father, which all resolves at the very end into a classic happy ending.  I read this quickly and then discussed it with my mother, who also had read it and loved it.<br /><br />

Autographed copy.  Finally I get around to Klosterman's first book, and the one his reputation rests upon.  I expected this to be a memoir about growing up in North Dakota, which is very slightly is, but really this is a dissection of 80's pop-metal through that unique Klosterman viewpoint - ie: writing intelligently about things not considered to be intelligent.  I read this in pretty much one sitting, at the airport and on my flight, and enjoyed every page.  I hadn't thought about <i>Use Your Illusion</i> or the Scorpions or a lot of these things in years, so it was a bit nostalgic for me even though I was never really into this stuff.  Has Adam Strohm read this?  I think he'd love it.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Taibbi's latest book is an attack on the contemporary American financial system, but it also finds time to skewer the Tea Party, a group who he (rather correctly, in my opinion) finds most frustrating than infuriating because their anti-elite sentiments are based in reality unlike most other issues in the right.  This book definitely gets into the nitty-gritty of credit default swaps, commodities future speculating, and other aspects of financial arcana, but he does so in his usual entertaining way.  I can't even guess how many times the word 'asshole' must appear in this book, but there really is no reason to mince words about these fuckers.  I was worried this would stir up some rage in me that I have no outlet for, and I was right.  These people are true monsters, criminals of the worst kind because instead of cunning, they are incompetent, and receive no punishment but rather benefits.  I'm pretty disillusioned with national-level American politics right now and this (plus all the horse-shit going on with the debt ceiling) is leading me to feel like maybe I will never vote again.  Incidentally, this was the first book I read in its entirety on an electronic device (the iPad) and I found the experience surprisingly pleasant.<br /><br />

Cost: $16<br/ >
I had mixed memories of DFW's first novel, and when I was looking for something to read on the train to the Adirondacks (cause I actually had nothing) this was the most interesting thing in the train station bookstore.  And since I've subsequently become a huge fan of DFW I thought this might be fun to revisit.  Well, maybe it was fun, but a better term would probably be 'spotty'.  This was his PhD work and it's really clear in how up and down it is, as well as some of the preoccupations with sexuality and race (the depiction of the novel's only [minor] black character is pretty much straight-up raycesss in the use of exaggerated ebonics).  This novel is relatively lightweight and it actually suffers from being too focused - there needs to be more a more expansive world, and more characters - instead, nothing is left to chance and the way all of the characters come together just feels cheap.  The surreal aspects, such as the giant desert in the middle of Ohio, are the more enjoyable aspects and I wish he had committed to a fucked-up parallel reality here as much as in <i>Infinite Jest</i>.  Of course, the main thing missing from this that is present in his later works is the sadness.  There are a few brief passages in <i>Broom of the System</i> that have some of the magic, but most of the novel is bogged down in bad dialogue. I admit that I didn't even want to finish it, but I kept holding out for some sort of payoff which isn't there.  This is time I could have spent reading <i>IJ</i> for the third time.<br /><br />

The Instructions<br/ >
Adam Levin<br/ >
Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $23.24<br/ >
Wow, <i>The Instructions </i>was an intense experience.  I got sucked into Levin's narrative and tore through this over a long weekend, anxious to get to the conclusion.  This heavy tome at first appeared to be a poor man's <i>Infinite Jest</i> or another entry into the child genius category (along with that Mark Haddon book, <i>Ratner's Star</i>, <i>The Last Samurai</i> and lots of other things).  But it didn't take long before I realised that neither of these comparisons were accurate.  <i>The Instructions</i> is a wonderful masterful world but (though some parts were definitely funny) hardly the comic masterpiece I would expect from a novel of this size.  It was deadly serious, really, and steeped in difficult issues, which the messianic 10-year-old narrator proved to be a great device to explore.  I'd be really curious how someone actually raised in the Jewish faith would take this, because I'm really not sure what viewpoint Levin is writing from.  At it's most genius moments, I realised how Gurion's mother played a major role in his persecution complex, and I read it as a criticism of such a viewpoint.  But then again, I am critical of that attitude myself, so I'm not sure if this is my own bias getting in the way.  The explosive final 150-200 pages are pretty unbelievable and written in an almost sports-journalism way, making it the most compelling long fiction passages since the murders section of <i>2666</i>.  This is really something powerful, and I think it's something I'll go back to, at least in passages, though the prose itself only reached magical moments through it's place in the whole work.  On a practical note, I'm disappointed in how poorly the hardback survived - the white pleather is filthy after just 5 days of reading, mostly in my house, and the book is practically falling apart already.  Or maybe that's just from how tight my fingers were grasping the pages. Now on to read external criticism and reviews!<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I borrowed this from Scott as for some reason I've never read it, despite sorta being into DeLillo and being a JFK assassination buff.  I was really impressed with <i>Libra</i>; he took the difficult task of inhabiting such a loaded historical figure and delicately picking aspects of the assassination record to highlight, and he did it deftly.  There was a whole lot of moving the plot here - the more 'literary' passages tended to fall to the wayside as it became more about the intricacies of the conspiracy.  DeLilllo is masterful though in how he humanises Oswald, but not really; from everything I had known about the person it seemed perfect, almost without conjecture (despite being entirely conjecture).  The final chapter attempts to be this "from a different voice" technique that he did with <i>The Names</i> but without as much stylistic experimentation, but it's a great cap to the novel and probably the biggest emotional moment.  The typically DeLillian dialogue was perfect when it's being spoken between Guy Banister and David Ferrie - these shadowy, not-quite-human figures are exactly the type of character that his novels are built around.  This definitely comes out of the style that <i>Players</i> and <i>Running Dog</i> were built from, but more sucessful than I remember either of those being.<br /><br />

Bissell's been writing video game criticism for Grantland, and even though I'm not really interested in video games I've been enjoying his writing more than anyone else on the site apart from maybe Bill Barnwell.  Scott knows him and lent me this collection of short stories, which is actually autographed by Bissell.  All of these stories are about Americans in former Soviet Central Asian countries for some reason, and are pretty bleak in their portrayals of both the Americans and the countries.  It's written with that same wry expatriate cynicism that Scott himself has and I am developing, and the criticism of the Americans is so strong that these stories don't feel explicitly racist.  Bissell can write, of course!  His fiction is just as good as his video game pieces, though of course totally different, yet still drawing me in completely.  As dark as most of these stories are, they're still quite hilarious, particularly 'The Ambassador's Son' which has a brash attitude that always conveys a fragility beneath the posturing.  Good work for sure, and I'm excited to check out Bissell's other books, particularly his one about video games.<br/><br /><br />

I realised already that I like Bissell a lot, as evidenced by the fact I've consumed his video game criticism for Grantland like a fly on shit.  Shit it's not; Bissell has insights into the art of video games that actually make me want to play them a bit.  In some ways, I think this is therapy for Bissell to justify how's he's pissed away so much of his time playing games, but he's clearly truly interested in the form and potential, and his criticisms are generally spot-on I think (even though I don't play them).  He approaches video games as a literary writer would, which is to emphasise their impact on society and culture rather than become fixated on the technical aspects - though he does have an appreciation for great design.  I wish I had met him with he was living in Tallinn and hanging out with Scott, though he seemed to be quite busy playing <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> and taking tons of cocaine.  But I hope he comes back to speak at our bookshop, as Scott seems to think he will.<br /><br />

This is my first experience reading Ellroy, who I always avoided I guess because it seemed like popular crime fiction, which is not a genre that ever interested me.  I was wrong - Ellroy is a master stylist, fairly experimental in his minimalism and with some incredible depictions of violence and brutality.  He deftly welded fictional characters into historical events, and the conversations with J Edgar Hoover and the Kennedys actually feel natural, and as realistic as can be.  The book is massive and the plot is almost overwhelming, but the three lead characters are so compelling in their moral oscillations that I think I'll read the sequel.<br /><br />

Cost: &pound;0.2<br/ >
I grabbed this for 20p at a library sale 3.5 years ago and it's been sitting on my shelf awaiting a re-read ever since.  Having a bookstore is actually motivation to clear these shelves as this book is better off in Slothrop's than Ptarmigan; I can sell this for probably 4.5-5 and more importantly own one less book myself.  I loved this the first time through for how frantic and hilarious it was, but this time I enjoyed it more for the strange juxtapositions of the two storylines.  The portrayal of mental illness by the narrator is often haunting, though there's also a liveliness to the proceedings that keeps it palatable.  The plot is the anchor that everything is wrapped around, though arguably "nothing happens".  Eggers' characters are so caught up in their own fantasies that it's not surprising when their travels don't work out as planned; reading this can be frustrating as it's so cavalier and wasteful of experience, which is precisely the point.  Lots of things could be said about the way these characters interact with other cultures, etc but I didn't read this negatively (Laura, who read this years ago, really hated it for how 'white' it was, which is also exactly the point, I think).<br /><br />

The Three Christs of Ypsilanti (New York Review Books Classics)<br/ >
Milton Rokeach<br/ >
Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $11.53<br/ >
The premise of this, a work of psychiatric research/nonfiction that has for some reason been reprinted under the esteemed NYRB Classics line, is that in 1959, three mental patients all believing themselves to be Jesus Christ were in the same mental hospital in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  The writer, Dr. Rokeach, conducted various experiements in group therapy over the course of two years, which are detailed in this book.  This gets into some pretty dangerous territory, of course -- conjuring visions of 1950's state medical facilities a la <i>Titicut Follies</i> -- but Rokeach is such a good writer that his compelling narrative overrides all.  There is a good deal of Rokeach as the "fourth Christ", as he admits in his afterword which curiously expresses guilt and regret at this experiment, which he realises was as much about him as the other three.  300 pages of the ramblings of the mentally insane is, as you can imagine, alternatingly hilarious and upsetting.  Overall, there's a horror that can't be denied, as the delusions of these poor souls are so overpowering.  Yet, Rokeach has a true compassion that comes through, even when attempting to be clinical and engaging in unethical, experimental manipulations of the three.  The eldest patient is barely a presence, with most of the book being dominated by the batshit-insane Leon Gabor, but the middle-aged Christ is fascinating as well.  I don't think the most inventive writer of fiction/fantasy oould begin to construct concepts as disillusioned as what comes out of the mouths of these three.  And while I was entertained by much of it, ultimately I couldn't enjoy myself too much because of the unending nightmare that these people were clearly trapped inside.  <i>The Three Christs of Ypsilanti</i> is incredible on many levels, not the least that it produces some minor moral dilemma in the reader.<br /><br />

I loaned this to Laura and she didn't love it, complaining about the misogynistic attitudes, etc.  I'm not bothered by that - I mean, this is possibly my very favourite novel ever, certainly in the top 3 or 4, and thus I re-read this in less than a day after she returned it, mostly on the way down to MoKs New Years.  And I loved every second of it, perhaps moreso than before.  I realised how strangely uneven it is - there are sections full of beautiful, clean writing about New Orleans and the strange air and detachment that infects Binx Bollings; but then, longer parts such as most of the business trip to Chicago that are less engaging and make me want to skip them.  But in the end, it's all amazing.  The way that Binx explicitly draws attention to his aimlessness is so exaggerated that I feel like it's a ruse; but then, it obviously hints at a truth underneath all of the false confidence.  It's also curious how his experience in Korea affected him; it's referenced a bit, most notably when talking to his mother, but he avoids committing to strong feelings even about that.  But perhaps this explains his viewpoint, his outlook and avoidance of the 'malaise'?  Maybe <i>The Moviegoer</i> is the quietest anti-war novel ever written.<br /><br />

Later McGuane is a lot less comic, but no less majestically constructed.  This is a total Western, in the way it's about the American west (in this case, Montana) though set in contemporary times and not about cowboys or indians.   This is a portrait of one character, and not much happens in it besides some marital infidelity and some strange encounters with family, but it's such great writing that I enjoyed it.  The pace really picked up at the end, and I appreciated how McGuane created such a realistic, rounded character instead of the hilarious cariacture that is so easy to do (ex: <i>Ray</i>, by Barry Hannah).  I also like how at the end, he actually ended up fulfilling his dreams but it's not really dramatic or important.  I have another McGuane on the shelf from the shop that I will probably read due to the scarcity of such a writer in the Baltic region, though it's from even later and I suspect even more 'serious'.<br /><br />

I took my time with this, a bookstore item that I was curious about as it has somewhat of a reputation as least among people who talk about Barry Hannah.  I've never read Hannah before, and was surprised at how transgressive his style was.  But I didn't really like <i>Ray</i>, as it's misogynism, however tongue-in-cheek and critical it may be, was ultimately overwhelming and actually a bit dull.  It's certainly short enough to get through quickly, and maybe that would have been a better way to parse it.  There's not much plot, as this is really a sketch, and while there were some dazzling, strange passages, I found myself unamused at the bawdyness.  This is another one of those quiet comments on Vietnam, like the McGuane novel I just finished, as Ray's horrible existence follows his service in a horrible war.  But I felt this tried a bit too hard for my liking; still curious about <i>Geronimo Rex</i>, though.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;25.19<br/ >
How does one even begin to assess <i>Estonia</i>, a book that feels like it was written especially for me?  At times, it felt like it was even written <i>by</i> me. I stopped at points and checked that I wasn't dreaming.  But actually, this book is a goddamned mess, a work of lunatic pseudo-scholarship that I can find little in to recommend to anyone unless they happen to also be American expats with a strong taste in eclectic and difficult postmodern literature and also living in Estonia.  The first thing to note is the ludicrous number of factual errors in this book, often to the point where I felt like it was intentional.  Though willful alteration of veracity and sheer "not giving a fuck" are two separate things and I'm not sure which side the falls on.  Now that I think about it, <i>Darconville's Cat </i>was also just as mad, and a great deal longer, and not about the country I live in, and I loved that too.  Theroux is dazzling; his sheer erudition blasts through everything, even when he's buried in his own cranky curmudgeonry or ranting nonstop about the linguistic oddities.  There are long irrelevant passages in this book - rants against Israel for 8 pages, or angry platitudes against the Bush/Cheney nightmare - that give me the impression Theroux felt this would be his last chance to ever publish anything, so he crammed in as much as possible even if it had nothing to do with Estonia.  But other parts are beautiful, savage and strange, and at times there are the same exhilarating and bizarre lists that populated the (many) pages of <i>Darconville</i>.  Thought its shocking - if not irresponsible - that this was published without even a rudimentary pass at fact-checking, the very existence of this book pleases me beyond belief, and reading it even moreso.  I will be referring to this forever, and maybe my overall enjoyment is the reason I took so long to get through it -- to savor its sweet, bitter, and generally flabbergasting words.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I loved this so much.  This is an eclectic collection of Lethem's miscellaneous writings, not entirely non-fiction, and not unaware of its own place as a compendium of his errant ideas.  There were some fantastic pieces here, the most famous probably being his Harper's essay defending plagiarism which is entirely made of plagiarized bits.  But also some gems such as his writings own cinema and music, lots of PK Dick of course, and especially interesting are Lethem's own acknowledgements of his success and expectations. He deals with the topics of the literary life in such an honest and insightful way that it's almost brave; there's no trace of ego, even when he's explaining how he was upset by a bad review he got from James Wood in the Times. I have a tremendous amount in common with Lethem, which is maybe why I have always clicked with his writings.  He makes his obsessions clear and doesn't hide from them, and there's some great writing on comics to show for it.  I tore through this lengthy work really quickly, only skimming the piece about Thomas Berger (who I have not yet read).  His 9/11 piece is here too, which is still probably the best writing on the event that I've ever read.  But the absolute best piece in here was a very experimental piece for a Fred Tomaselli exhibition catalogue at the Fruitmarket in Edinburgh in 2004, an exhibition I saw and was pretty blown away by (yet never picked up the catalog so I had no idea Lethem contributed to it).  It's a really amazing interpretation of visual art with almost no literal connection, a beautiful example of trans-disciplinary thinking in action. Plus,he interviews Dylan!  Great, great, great.<br /><br />

Harbach's acclaimed novel wasn't very well-written, but managed to keep me reading til the end.  I would equate this to Jonathan Franzen-lite; about on par with <i>Freedom</i> (but less ambitious); not even close to <i>The Corrections</i>, though it was trying to be a different thing.  It was actually somewhat messy in terms of focus, and while it ended up being an ensemble novel masquerading as having a single protagonist (at least in the beginning) this caused whatever connection I might have to any characters to disintegrate.  The most interesting aspect of this was actually the sports material; basing a novel around Steve Blass Disease (if it had only stayed true to that!) is a great concept, and Harbach did avoid really cheese bottom-of-the-9th walkoff grand slam hyperbole (for the most part).  The fictional college wasn't even very believable (early on we're told that the president of the college knows the names of all 2000 students, which is preposterous) and the too-perfect campus life just struck me as wishful thinking.  I guess I read through this because it was easy and I needed a diversion, but I don't recommend it, even in the slightest.<br /><br />

Sari turned this over to Slothrop's; it's the copy I bought her as a graduation gift (which she read). I'm going to keep this for now and re-read it as it's been years and I need to see if this is still among my few very favourite books. ;; Yeah, it still rules. And knowing how I felt the last two times, it's gonna resonate more and more in the next few days as I think about it. There's the added impact now that I am also an expatriate living in Estonia where I have dabbled in a social circle sort of like James Axton's (thinking mostly about Scott's group of weird expat friends). The displacement, detachment and selfishness of Axton make a bit more sense to me. His outrageous flirting, which is outright harassment, doesn't warm me up to him, yet I don't think DeLillo is trying to make him a protagonist per se, just an observer. Having also been to Greece and India since my last read helps, though I'm not just a fan of this book because I'm impressed by its accuracy of depiction. Really, the power of this book is in how it explores the act of articulation through all of its linguistic obsessions, the muted speech (and thoughts) of Axton, and the way his son is this moral presence throughout. Not to mention his final chapter, which I think is even more imprerssive than <i>Riddley Walker</i> (though it's not as full of a deconstruction). Is this actually my favourite book? Certainly top 5. Yet I'm gonna sell this copy in the shop cause it's beat to shit and I can always get a nicer one.<br /><br />

Wow. This was amazing, both as an innovative hybrid of personal writing and fiction, and also as a brilliant statement of artistic identity. This is Sari's favourite book ever and I completely see why; there's a million reasons you can go back to it and as an artistic statement of purpose it's remarkable. Kraus writes so confidently that she essentially defines a new genre of feminism here, though one that is flexible and realistic. The honesty in this book transcends any fictionalisation that might have occured and it somehow manages to be simultaneously emotional and intellectual, which is perhaps what is so remarkable about her viewpoint. I will write about this more later when I am more coherent.<br /><br />

Escape the Overcode: Activist Art in the Control Society<br/ >

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I found this in the bathroom at Tiib and borrowed it from Flo back in August. I kept forgetting to finish it, but today I knocked out the last chapter. Taking three months in between the last time I read it made it a bit inconclusive to me, but overall I was pretty impressed with this work. Holmes (who I met at Pixelache last year, and is totally brilliant) attempts to explore the role of activism in contemporary art, using the Deleuze and Guattari concept of 'overcoding'. His writing is so straight-forward and lucid that I was able to understand the vast majority of this, only getting lost around the part about Guattari's <i>Schizoid Cartographies</i> project, but I've tried to wrap my head around that (unsuccessfully) multiple times. This book was actually light reading at times - the majority of it discusses individual projects, most of which I was not familiar with, and some that I will definitely investigate. (I watched <i>Das Net</i> after reading Holmes's chapter on it; there's also a great dissection of Adam Curtis's work). In some places Holmes casually throws around some great ideas, such as his definition of art as an experimental field for the production of subjectivities. I have been interested a lot in how art can respond to 20th century ideas of cybernetics and information organisation, so this was a great thing to read - I wish I had focused on it more, but it will always be in the toilet if I want to give it another go.<br /><br />

Cost: $23.9<br/ >
So fucking pumped about this, but it will probably have to wait until I'm back from Stockholm. ;; <div><br/></div><div>Writing about this is proving to be hard. Ironic, really, since this is a book about language becoming a poison and the impossibility of communication. I just re-read <i>The Names </i>and in some ways this is like taking it to another level, inventing a link between language and death, and constructing articulation as impossible.<div><br/></div><div>But <i>The Flame Alphabet</i> is Ben Marcus significantly reinventing himself, in a similar to manner to how his past work reinvents the meaning of our words. Here, all of that is gone; the prose is, well, prosaic; though there are stunning passages, particularly when describing food, minerals and other natural elements, this is really an attempt to write something more 'real'. What this resulted in for me, as a reader, was pure pain. I found this so brutal and dark that it was at times unbearable, and my initial excitement at having a new Ben Marcus book quickly turned into something oppressive and actually I dreaded reading. Without the beauty of <i>Notable American Women</i>'s magical prose, this became something very realistic, despite the fantastic setting and premise. It's maybe too easy to read into this as being about something you love killing you, but it sure resonated with me. Moreso than just being about fatherhood, <i>The Flame Alphabet</i> tries to reconcile a lot of pain but offers no answers. There's no hope here - it just gets bleaker and bleaker as it goes on. <div><br/></div><div>By the end I was trying to cling to the parts of this book that were truly amazing - the Jewish holes, for example - and let the misery wash over me. It's also evident that Marcus is trying to address his own challengers as a writer here through the child character and the language-as-poison device. In some ways I am proud of him for trying to push himself to a new level, abandoning what made his first two books so earth-shattering. But this isn't a stab towards accessibility at all - it's a maelstrom of psychic demons that really got into my head as well, and attained a physicality rarely felt in English literature. I probably sound like I hated this, or I am dismissing it, but far from it - this was unforgettable experience and in some ways reinforces my faith in Marcus, even if I don't actually want to ever read it again.</div></div></div><br /><br />

Burroughs is pretty compelling; I really enjoyed <i>Running with Scissors</i> since it combined a really fucked up story with pretty great humorous writing (to the point of extremity) and it was a fast read. The middle third threatened to become a gay soap opera, and the ending was almost too over-the-top sentimental/emotional, bu t then it was still undercut with the sharp wit and self-effacing style that makes Burroughs so good. I should organise a course around books about alcoholism - this, <i>A Fan's Notes</i>, <i>Under the Volcano</i> ... hmm, what else?<br /><br />

Hunter S. Thompson<br/ >
Source: Slothrop's<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
A bunch of Hunter S. Thompson books came into the shop, I think from Slava, and I picked this one up to read over the weekend. I've always felt that the problem with Thompson is that his writing is actually really uneven, particularly towards the end of his life. This is the very end, constructed as an autobiography of sorts, but really a mishmash of odds and ends lying around. The theme is presumaby post-9/11 America seen through HST's eyes, but some of the pieces date back to the 80s and 90s. This fragmented nature is actually what I liked most about the book, though there is very little to dazzle. I was struck by how honest Thompson is throughout, even when spinning obvious bullshit (like about how he nearly blew up Jack Nicholson's house and left a bleeding elk heart in the door). The mythology around him was largely the embellishments of others, and he manages to dispel some of it without directly doing so. There's a lot of material about his sexual assault case in 1990 which comes off as sour grapes, but I genuinely believe he was innocent (as much as is possible given that I wasn't there and have only heard his side of the story) and the archival stuff from <i>High Times</i> about it is strangely compelling. So overall I'd say I liked <i>Kingdom of Fear</i> even though it wasn't particularly good; if you go into this expecting something actually cohesive, then you might want to look elsewhere. I suspect the best book about Thompson's life is going to be written by somebody else - maybe some of the other biographies out there will be more illuminating.<br /><br />

Cost: $17.32<br/ >
Price includes shipping + customs. This was stunning - a lightning strike of a novella that deftly balanced horror, mental dissolution, sexuality and comedy. <i>Senselessness</i> is a novel of avoidance, though it doesn't work; it intentionally juxtaposes sleazy male sexuality with genuinely terrible atrocity, in a way that smashed into my brain due to Moya's style. This book was a series of extreme run-on sentences, which flowed quickly and naturally, like a true fountain of consciousness. It felt real, and hilarious, and it hurt at times to laugh. The narrative propels towards a resolution in absentia, and it's a punch in the gut. This really didn't feel like any Latin or Spanish-language writer I had read before, not did it feel like a descendent of the Joyce/Gaddis/Barth rivers. It's a singular masterpiece, readable in about an hour, and riveting on every page.<br /><br />

Zombie Spaceship Wasteland: A Book by Patton Oswalt<br/ >
Patton Oswalt<br/ >
Source: Demonoid<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Patton Oswalt's book is surprisingly great - he clearly has talent as a prose writer, probably far above average for a comedian. The book veers between autobiographical sections and more goofy, funny stuff like fake wine lists and information about hobos. The funniest of these sections were his script doctor's notes for a fake film called <i>And Now You May Miss the Bride</i>, about an amnesia-stricken marriage - but there were other really funny parts throughout. But the personal stuff, though scattered, is really the highlight. The titular essay is a genius theory about teenage misfits, which I heard him lay out on the BS Report back when this came out, and I actually wish it was a bit longer and more expanded. The long section about a miserable week spent in a Vancouver suburb is great, though probably a far more universal experience for comedians that we'd hope. My one complaint would be that this felt disjointed and fragmentary - almost as if Oswalt was not ready to commit fully to autobiography, which I think would have been more enjoyable. In that way, it reminds me of the Hunter Thompson book I just finished, though that randomness suits Thompson far more than Oswalt.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Frank's latest book looks at how contemporary right-wing movements such as the Tea Party have co-opted the rhetoric of the left and the underclasses to define a new narrative of victimisation. This isn't wildly different from what they have done for years with the media, except that here they are mostly abandoning social conservativism and actually misplacing what should be geniune anger at the Wall Street bailouts, TARP, etc. And the lies are even more ridiculous since at least abortion provided a good cover; here, the cries of socialism are just utterly ridiculous and blatantly misleading. There wasn't anything new here for me as I've lived through this and followed it closely, but I wanted to read it anyway because I like Frank's style and have read his other books. This actually gets into some history, going back to the Great Depression, and his lefty roots really show in how he's able to compare reactions of the 1930s to the present. I didn't love this - Frank attacks Glenn Beck often, which already feels somewhat dated, and at one point launches into a takedown of Ayn Rand which is entertaining but a bit tangential. But overall, I'm glad I read it as it was quick, and Frank managed to get through the book without patronising anybody (which I don't think I could have done). I'm glad that Frank has crossed into the mainstream market succesfully, but part of me wishes he was still writing more about culture and its political machinations, which was a really unique and brilliant niche that <i>The Baffler</i> carved out. I guess this book IS about culture and its political machinations, but not in the same way.<br /><br />

Subtitled 'How We Got Here', Gleick has created a massive overview of information in the modern era. The book is scholarly, yet populist - the kind of intelligent nonfiction that is probably (sadly) disappearing from bookstores. Because I've always had an interest in the history of computing, I was familiar with the stores of Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, etc. -- but Gleick did not present them as just another history of how computers and the Internet emerged, but rather an overall view of information as a concept. I actually thought this was going to be much longer but the last 40% of the book were all notes (and because I read this as an e-book, a process which is becoming increasingly more common and normal to me) I didn't realise this, so it felt like a sudden ending. The chapter on Wikipedia was particularly great, as it looked at the underlying absurdity that lies beneath such a project, and the frightening ways in which problems self-correct themselves. This is sort of a beach book for nerds, but Gleick avoids making any predictions or other hyperbolic statements, so it ends up being just really really <i>good</i>.<br /><br />

The Raw Shark Texts: A Novel<br/ >
Steven Hall<br/ >
Source: Slothrop's<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Ultimately, I'd categorise <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i> into the genre of 'Guardian books', which is my derogatory term for these popular British novels that are depressingly middlebrow, but unfortunately what passes for literary culture in the UK today. I include this alongside Zadie Smith and that one terrible Russell Hoban novel I read, and the <i>Curious Case of the Dog</i> and <i>What a Carve-Up!</i> and all those books. And that's not to say that I don't enjoy reading some of these works, but that I don't think they are ultimately anything special or artistic. Hall's novel starts off very promising - I love amnesia as a theme, and the descriptive prose was quite evocative, particularly when writing about loss and memory. Then things get crazy, in a <i>Southland Tales </i>style, but in a way lacks a pull. I need something to make me want to inhabit these imaginary worlds, at least temporarily, and <i>Raw Shark</i> was too focused on defining it's own rules, which it doesn't even do well - it's vague, and continually used the word 'conceptual' as if just saying that word is enough, without actually knowing what that concept is. By the end, it had descended into just a fantasy/adventure story, albeit one with interesting objects around. I enjoyed reading it though, but I wouldn't recommend it or ever want to read it again.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
The comedy press was kind to this, and I started it cautiously, knowing Agent Mosurak didn't like it. I didn't either, maybe even hating this, but hate is a strong word and I managed to finish it, even though I realised about halfway through that there would be no payoff. To some extent, I was engaged by reading a memoir by someone who is exactly my age and from a relatively similar background; her cultural concerns, which to her credit were the backlighting rather than a backdrop, resembled my own in some places. I don't fault Klausner for structuring a novel around her sexual history, though I can see why this is an easy criticism from a feminist critique, or at least from the Bechdel test angle. It's great that Klausner is sex-positive and writes unapologetically about this, and maybe her constant unmet desire to be fulfilled by a male could be viewed as some natural human need for a partnership instead of a culturally-constructed dependency. But ultimately, this wasn't particularly funny. Klausner spends the early chapters creating a persona of herself as a sympathetic teenage misfit, and then later in life, proceeds to berate some of her flings for similar traits that she would have been picked on for herself when younger. Part of my problem is that I recently read <i>I Love Dick</i> which is about as masterful as you can get in discussing contemporary feminine sexuality. Kraus is no less personal and not much more intellectual, but she describes an emotional life that is tied in with her creativity and sexuality, and the process, articulates an amazing definition of identity. Klausner comes off really just like an R-rated Liz Lemon, only more aggressive. I just broke up with someone who is exactly like this. It's certainly not my place to proscribe what personality types define womanhood, but I see Liz Lemon as a critique, not a hero. Klausner is someone who spends 210 pages admonishing men for not being able to get over themselves when she can't either.<br /><br />

This drive across the country is really an excuse for Klosterman to lay out his weird pop culture and music obsessions and dwell on the women in his life. I hadn't read anything this personal before by him and was glad for it because it was a nice snapshot of a 31 year old with various musical obsessions and differing levels of social detachment.

Klosterman's first work of fiction is like a more superficial, less 'literary' David Foster Wallace, and I'm surprised I never made the connection between the two before. Of course, they write from completely different perspectives, but both have a love of pedantic exposition and an absurd ability to juxtapose sadness with humour. This is Klosterman's "North Dakota" novel for sure, and wraps up as a marvelously entertaining ball of existentialism, though I felt unsatsified. I wish he had spent less time trying to emphasise the isolation of these small communities, and also dropped the anachronistic narratorial asides. But the portraits he creates are compelling and I found this as entertaining as everything else he's ever written.<br /><br />

As erotica goes, or maybe straight-up pornography, this is the most absurd, lunatic, ridiculous writing I've ever encountered. Baker tops even the blue movie scene of <i>Tlooth</i> here, and I must admit that I greatly enjoyed it. If you want to read about people transported to magical spaces via their own dickholes, women masturbating with screwdrivers, cock transplants, and pinecones that inspire anal sex, this is your work. The language is absurd, and there's a weird undercurrent of commerce behind everything - Baker's sexual fantasies cost the characters money, sometimes more - and because of that there's a creepy dystopian vibe to it all. That, when juxtaposed with language that's often too over-the-top to be arousing, makes this a really weird and uncertain mixture, almost like it's designed to create a guilt or conflict in the brains of those with purely prurient interests. For that reason alone I thought it was amazing, and certainly better than <i>Vox</i> or <i>The Fermata</i>, though I haven't read either of those since the 90s.<br /><br />

I felt like reading this again and I downloaded an ebook of it and blasted through it while in Poland, which was a nice juxtaposition against the definitely un-Glasslike surroundings of Skoki. There's such a momentum to this story even though nothing actually happens, and I can't quite figure out what the 'Franny' section at the beginning is really for, as Salinger seems to use it only to establish Franny's personality and give us the context of her teenage heartbreak. Burgeoning maturity is so universalised here despite the affluence of the characters, and it's an America that I myself never lived in but sure can imagine. We put a quote from Bessie Glass on our Slothrop's gift vouchers, 'You can't live in this world with such strong likes and dislikes', said of course to Zooey, and I wonder if Salinger actually agrees with her. The flawed hero has never been more perfectly cast than Zooey Glass, and his affectations were so booming that it was like he was in the room with me.<br /><br />

Hunter S. Thompson<br/ >

Cost: &euro;11.18<br/ >
I guess I'm on a bit of a Hunter Thompson kick, and this is the work of his that I've always most wanted to read -- I eventually just broke down and bought a copy locally since I couldn't find it online (though every other of his books seems to be available). In this, I was surprised to discover something far different than I expected. Thompson's coverage of the McGovern campaign is actually extremely journalistic, and not as 'gonzo' as you'd believe. There's definitely a sharp, irreverent edge, but it's mostly inside-baseball talk about Democratic party machinations, which I found to be fascinating (and relevant to today's electoral system). There's a depressing vibe of course, but interestingly, Thompson doesn't talk about Nixon much at all - the October section of the book is essentially excised and the Democratic ticket is the real emphasis. This is actually pretty amazing, and I think McGovern himself called it "the best account of the campaign and also the least accurate". It might be worth reading Crouse's <i>Boys on the Bus</i> , which we have in the shop right now, to compare. McGovern's primary was so similar to Obama's 2008 run that it's scary, except Obama knew how to avoid the mistakes McGovern had made, and then ended up destroying his credibility and installing the same ol' shitbags anyway once he won. But it's fascinating anyway, and also surprising how 40 years ago wasn't any less cynical than today; just maybe more neurotic. If you actually need proof that HST is a great writer, this is the place to go; he's brutally honest and doesn't spend much time trying to project a wild man image, instead capturing a pulse that is quite radical for political writing and impressively timeless.<br /><br />

I really enjoyed <i>Gascoyne</i>, and how can you not? It never slows down, attaining a velocity that makes it feel like radical artwork. But it's nothing too innovative - just a genre-bending mashup of crazy sci-fi, proto-cyberpunk 'tude, and a strange take on outlaw/beat narrative. Having read the beautiful longing of <i>SS Mrs Unguentine</i>, this is a different beast entirely. I would have read this much more quickly except I didn't take it to Poland and got distracted by other things. I think this was Crawford's first novel and it definitely has a youthful exuberance to it, even if the protagonist is an elderly man. The obsession with speed, cars, and violence recalls the work of the Futurists more than any American hot-rod culture; it's very strange in it's cultural niche and funny at times, in an absurd way. I didn't LOVE this but I enjoyed it greatly, and it was an easy, fun read even if I didn't care much about the workings of its hard-boiled plot.<br /><br />

Chris Kraus<br/ >
Source: Rahva Raamatud, Viru Keskus<br/ >
Cost: &euro;12.47<br/ >
I was seduced by this, due to it's attractive cover and being by Chris Kraus. It's in Semiotext(e)'s <i>Interventions</i> series, though I'm not sure what is interventionist about it. This is a series of short essays about different contemporary art practices, beginning with the Tiny Creatures scene in Los Angeles, and also dealing with the work of the Bernadette Corporation, contemporary attitudes towards video, and a sex workers tour that Kraus participated in herself. It seems fairly disorganised, almost like she collected a few different essays that were loosely related. The subjects of these essays all somewhat integrate art and life in a way that feels natural to me, being of my age and with my own lifestyle, though clearly this is out of step with traditional art practices. There's nothing particularly radical about it, at least for me, but Kraus's journalistic style is as wonderfully open as <i>I Love Dick</i> was, so there's a strong integration of her personal warmth with extremely subjective yet insightful analysis. While overall I would call this a bit lightweight, and maybe not remarkable enough to be drawn together into a bound volume, I greatly enjoyed reading it, and maybe it's better that she avoided a strong, unifying conclusion.<br /><br />

Chasing the Sea: Lost Among the Ghosts of Empire in Central Asia<br/ >
Tom Bissell<br/ >
Source: Slothrop's<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Bissell does it again, and I realise that he's done it in multiple genres. This is a book about Uzbekistan, and it's fascinating, top-quality travel writing. Bissell confronts his own demons about his failed Peace Corps run, and his return is laced with outrage and humour. His writing is stunning at times, conveying a distant and disturbing country that's intriguing as well as horrifying. The purpose of his journey is ostensibly to write about the Aral Sea crisis, and it takes him 340 pages to get there, before abruptly ending. In the meantime, he spins his experience into a general travel book, a narrative of Central Asia that makes me want to visit despite the chaos. Bissell's writing about the environmental catastrophe that is the Aral Sea is focused and powerful, and he doesn't hold any punches against either the Soviet regime responsible for the problem or the Karimov regime that's furthered it. I only wish this was longer, and it's made me think how I should read more travel writing.<br /><br />

Gulcher: Post-Rock Cultural Pluralism in America (1649-1993)<br/ >
Richard Meltzer<br/ >

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Grabbed this off the shelf for a re-read as this had trended on PBT and totally was blown away. I can't remember when I read this before - I'm guessing around my freshman or sophmore year at Pitt? - but now I'm even more into these pranky anti-writing shenanigans. At times I wondered why I was reading it, or why anyone would write some of the pieces. The bottle cap collection is great, the few bits actually about music are stellar, the irrelevant spors rants are hilarious if you can follow them, and the chapter where he calculated the missing numbers in the free throw statistics from a smudged Topps basketball card is the best of all. This is conceptualism, I'd say, though it's too fun and creative to fall into Kenneth Goldsmith's 'uncreative writing' genre. Because it's hilarious! I'm really glad this is in print - it's a real masterpiece of sorts, and addresses a narrowly disappearing generation.<br /><br />

A Year With Swollen Appendices: Brian Eno's Diary<br/ >

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I savoured this. Eno's diary, kept in 1995, is simultaneously simple and magical. I've always been a fan of Eno, but this cemented my appreciation of his life and work. For someone occasionally portrayed as overly cerebral and "pretentious" (the takedown of which term he executes in one of the many appendices), this is actually written with great honesty and humility. I loved the insight into his creative life, and I found it inspiring without any particular point sticking out. Some days, the mere mention of what he made for dinner, or the walk he took with his children was enough to inspire me. The appendices are hit and miss, but a few are brilliant, such as his analyses of defense spending, axis thinking, and celebrity charity. What a brilliant book - this is something I'm going to have to get for myself to read again, for the 'open randomly' value is quite high. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />

Seven Days in the Art World<br/ >
Sarah Thornton<br/ >
Source: Ville Hyvönen<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Ville for some reason loaned me this, which is a look at the art world circa 2004-2006 written from the perspective of a sociologist. This angle proved to be a good one, as there was little ass-kissing or attempts to seem knowledgeable. I found this pretty rewarding, especially given my work -- I usually say that I am not part of the world of contemporary art at all, but I run alongside that word occasionally picking and choosing aspects of it. With my trip to Documenta in a few weeks it's probably good that I have at least a passing knowledge of this world. I was pretty bored by the chapters on <i>Artforum </i>and Art Basel, yet I found the looks at the Christie's auction and the biennale fascinating. Thornton isn't particularly critical of this giant world of shit, though it's contradictions are certainly not lost on her. My favourite chapter was the one on Michael Asher's crit at CalArts, for one thing because I have been employed by CalArts for over two years but know little about the institutions; my 'boss' at EoB (I guess, though I never talked to him) is discussed in that article as well. The net affect of reading this was to make me more knowledgeable about the art world, though I don't know if that's a good idea -- maybe my naievete keeps me insulated from this stuff. I generally think of 'art' as a much broader concept than the fine art-based practices described here, and likewise I see there being multiple infinite art worlds instead of a singular one, so I would have titled this<i> Seven Days in An Art World</i> but that's a minor quibble I guess.<br /><br />

Started this before the new year when a copy came into the shop, but then someone bought it so I borrowed Sari's to finish it, but then shelved it for months before returning to it in a "I better clear off the loan shelf so i can then clear off the stuff I borrowed from Slothrop's so I can then clear off the few hundred books I own and haven't read yet." I've only read bits of Sontag before in short essay form, which is what this was too, though all of the essays were about photography. This was good reading, even in this broken-up fashion, as I've been mildly into photography theory, moreso than I'm actualy into photography. This wasn't quite as conceptual as Villem Flusser, though got into similar topics about the camera as an instrument of control, etc. Sontag got much more into the art world agendas of photography, specifically the relationship that photography has to surrealism, etc. She touched on specific work by most of the big-name 20th Century photograhpers - Cartier-Bresson, Adams, Stieglitz, Arbus - and ended with a chapter of fun, provocative quotations. I don't know if I took anything away from this as a whole - the issues of photography and representation are quite complex and occasionally contradictory -- and in some ways I think Godard's <i>Letter to Jane</i> might say it better than anything.<br /><br />

Drew Magary is pretty much the funniest person on the Internet, but this novel wasn't nearly as enjoyable as any random Deadspin Funbag. I thought this Philip K Dick-style plot would be mixed with his irreverent humour, but instead he tried to play it straight, and created a novel that is easy enough to read but not compelling enough to actually enjoy. There's something a bit lazy about the whole thing, almost hardboiled but without the fun aspects. I don't meant to rag on him too hard because he's clearly trying to be more than guy who writes about poop on the Internet, but there's honestly nobody better out there at that, so I would be happy with a 600 page book of Funbag letters to read while pooping myself. Better luck next time.<br /><br />

<i>Absurdistan</i> seemed trapped between being a nothing's-sacred satire of contemporary life in the former Soviet states and a genuine political critique. I wasn't sure how to ultimately assess this book, which was fun and entertaining enough but didn't actually succeed in being as funny as it thought - in other words, it expected to coast on its own humour for large parts when I actually found the characterisations lacking. The non-fiction writing of Tom Bissell's Uzbekistan probably does a better job at portraying this mentality than Shteyngart, who also put a thinly veiled version of himself in the story. But, entertaining enough for sure.<br /><br />

Jon Ronson is always nonfiction-candy and <i>The Psycopath Test</i> is no different than his other books. As usual he interjected his research with his own not-always-believable comic exchanges, which worked great here because the material was so dark. There's a bit of ramble before it becomes clear what he's getting at, and the test itself is a small part of the book. I read this on the bus from Riga to Tallinn so it went quick but provided the entertainment and diversion I wanted. There are some really genuinely intriguing bits of criminology discussed here, and maybe I should crack open that Colin Wilson book I have to follow this up.<br /><br />

Greil Marcus<br/ >
Source: Slothrop's<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
The second time through I found <i>Invisible Republic</i> much more enjoyable. One reason is that I no longer let Marcus's embellishments bother me, but instead treated them as his writing personality and I really found the writing quite moving at points. The other reason of course is that I've become way, way into the Basement Tapes since the first time I read this, even visiting the (yard of the) house they were recorded in. The historical writing about Dock Boggs, Frank Hutchinson, Clarence Ashley, etc is actually fantastic - it has the same mix of speculation and accuracy that Tosches awesome book about Emmett Miller has. The only times I really couldn't take this was when Marcus would write things about how, say, Dylan's version of 'Ballad of a Thin Man' live in Manchester captured the turbulence of America's civil rights struggle in between every piano chord, etc. The overblown desire to inflate great music by nailing it to every historical event that is happening is like an unsubtle <i>Mad Men</i>, but when you get past that, there's a pretty great take on the music that shows Marcus can really listen (and not just overthink). This came into the shop and I was going to read it and return it, but I think I will actually keep it, partially because the reference material in the back is so valuable (the breakdown of all <i>Basement Tapes</i> songs).<br /><br />

I wasn' t wildly impressed with <i>Deer Hunting for Jesus</i>, which started out as a folksier, more personal version of <i>What's the Matter with Kansas</i> but ended up just being a long rant against American 'heartland' culture. Of course I agree with Bageant, but 250 pages attacking born-again fundamentalists in Winchester, VA gets repetitive. Instead of offering any real suggestions, he just repeats the same rants that I spent the Bush years saying myself. His authority rests on that he is from this town, his brother is a preacher now, etc. but it just makes him come off as a dickhead. I finished this because I hate leaving easy things unfinished but it was a waste of an afternoon for sure.<br /><br />

Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $23.81<br/ >
Karapanou's novel is unique in it's genre-shifting and accesibility, with some really dark undercurrents and the creepy Greek island vibe of DeLillo's <i>The Names</i>. But the similarity ends at the murders; where DeLillo's book is about what is not said (despite being about language), Karapanou's is explicit. According to the translator's notes, the original Green is a hodgepodge of various dialects and voices, so this is an example where that is lost in translation. It's an ensemble character, with only one real protagonist (clearly the stand-in for the writer) and a possibly realistic depiction of expatriates in the Greek islands. The high level of homosexual characters, most of whom are portrayed as fickle and creepy, suggests a judgemental view from Karapanou, though I also suspect these characters are based on people she actually knew. The magical realist elements were unevenly spaced, which led this to feel like a genre-shifting experiment. The writing was lucid and direct, and I think she had quite a reputation in Greece before her death; I don't know that I'm super motivated to read anything else by her, however.<br /><br />

Love and Hydrogen: New and Selected Stories<br/ >
Jim Shepard<br/ >
Source: Half Price Books, South Hills Village<br/ >
Cost: $4.98<br/ >
Shepard's story collection was dazzling, though as with any short story collection, not every one was totally enjoyable. At times I was amazed that he could 'pull it off' - there's some incredible conceits here, such as writing from the perspective of John Entwhistle or John Ashcroft, both of which are done very well. The tone shifts from light and comic, like in the opening story, to quite emotional and powerful (the story about the volcano researcher and his emotionally disturbed brother attains a genuine sadness and pain that's quite impressive) but nothing is ham-fisted or distraught. This is a long way from John Updike's endless stories about boring couples; Shepard really gets adventurous with his concepts yet it never comes off as <i>McSweeney</i>'s-style quirk or novelty. The title story, an imagined clandestine gay relationship between two <i>Hidenburg</i> technicians, is particularly stunning, and the best thing about all of these stories is that the end before they exhaust their ideas. I should read more short stories in general, and certainly more Shepard. No relation to the Vertical Slit guy, btw.<br /><br />

The Spirit of Disobedience: Resisting the Charms of Fake Politics, Mindless Consumption, and the Culture of Total Work<br/ >
Curtis White<br/ >
Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $17.68<br/ >
Price includes shipping + customs. I like Curtis White lots, and this started from a great premise - that most attitudes critical to capitalism ie: the left/liberal tradition, deny their essential spirituality, which is also their downfall. This leads White to a rejection of Reason and Enlightenment thinking as a polar opposite of the religious mania that has taken over America, and he cites Thoreau most notably as being one who realised the soul as essential to dissent. The middle of this book mostly turns into an attack on contemporary American (written in 2006) and the enviornment-pillaging, me-first anti-Christian ethos pushed by both parties. It's not exactly anything I haven't heard, and while compared to <i>Deer Hunting for Jesus</i> this is practically nuanced, I started to tire of it. The examples drawn from pop culture (<i>Office Space</i> and <i>DaVinci Code</i>) were fun in that Zizek way, though less intense; I wanted a bit more on that actually. I definitely need to see more Fassbinder, though. The last section of the book consists of three interviews, which were not incredibly enjoyable - James Howard Kunstler being the most interesting. I felt like White really built this up as a major philosophical work and then got too distracted pointing out flaws in American society to really make a grand step forward intellectually, though there's a lot here to work with.<br /><br />

I was genuinely impressed with <i>The Imperfectionists</i>, which deftly wove together an accessible ensemble narrative that did a lot of subtle and impressive things. Rachman is going to be somebody to watch; while I thought this was going to be fairly lightweight, by the end I was shocked at how much it managed to achieve in a relatively short page count. I liked how it took the obvious route of commenting on the death of traditional media, but by showing how much our own lives are intertwined with it all. The various characters come and go from each others stories and it's a classic unreliable narrator device, just fragmented into multiple points of view. I now look forward to whatever he produces next.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;8<br/ >
This is DeLillo's second novel and even though it was written 40 years ago, it seems like the game of American Football hasn't changed that much. I loved this; I was shocked at how compelling the writing was, for DeLillo really knows what he's talking about when it comes to the sport, and the many levels of jargon and slang are perfectly suited to a writer like him. The idea that any college football players would talk like this - like Don DeLillo characters - is ridiculous - but this book seemed to be aiming at a humourous effect, with distinct jokes and situations which were mostly successful. The middle section of the book, describing the game itself, is set apart from the rest of the novel, and contains some of the most perfect sportswriting I've ever encountered. The typical concerns of a DeLillo protagonist are evident - fear of death, nuclear obsession, etc - but what makes this so remarkable is how DeLillo avoids the on-field comparisons to war, instead relegating that topic to a parallel narrative. This was a good read to anticipate the NFL season; it has some passages that are absolutely brilliant, yet tossed-off and lacking the weight of his later writing, which actually was pretty nice for once.<br /><br />

A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain<br/ >

Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $23.97<br/ >
Owen Hatherley writes from that classic British Marxist viewpoint which <i>The Guardian</i> used to still represent - I guess he's one of the last dying vestiges of that paper's tradition. <i>A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain</i> emulated Pevsner's architecture guides but from the post-Blair perspective, mocking the failures of New Labour's aesthetic vision. Each chapter takes a specific city and chronicles some of the most egregious council estates, pedestrianised shopping districts, public buildings, and other such things. This was a long read and I put it down a few times, because while I had visited most cities in the book, I didn't have a deep familiarity with any of them besides Glasgow and Newcastle. The Glasgow chapter was the money shot for me, and it really accurately details the conflicts apparent within Glasgow architecture. Hatherley's tone is sharp, and his politics are unabashedly socialist (he frequently discusses public work commissioned with political intent, and has a clear hardon for old-timey socialist workers' art and lore), but he is actually quite fair at times. There's grudging praise for a few buildings, and he doesn't beat a dead horse. Reading about architecture isn't my favourite way to experience it but his erudition, research, and interesting asides (into Newcastle politics, of the cultural makeup of Sheffield) made this overall worth my time.<br /><br />

A copy of <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> came into the shop, and since Sigbjørn and I were just talking about it, I decided to re-read it before putting it out for sale. The second time through I found myself feeling like I was reading it for the first time. I remembered it being hilarious, which it was, but I didn't really see it as such a horror story. This is truly a nightmare of a man trapped inside his own head, and while it's played for classic Jewish psycho-sexual laughs, the amount of repression and anger is devastating. It's not a tragedy - it's enormously fun to read - but I'm impressed at how much of a double-edged sword it is, at points. Conflating sexual repression with Jewish identity is nothing new, but you gotta love parts where he's jacking in it bed while reading Freud. I should really read something else by Roth, but I'm strangely uninterested in the rest of his work.<br /><br />

I'd wanted to read this for awhile and was delighted to find a copy online. This helped pass the 9 hour flight between Helsinki and Chicago. I generally love reading interviews - after all, that's what I'm going to be doing as a big project in March in Helsinki. This worked so well because it balanced contemporary comedy writers like Robert Smigel against people who wrote for Milton Berle. The current of comedy hasn't really changed - what rides through all the interviews is the level of professionalism and commitment to the art. Because this was about writing, rather than performing, it had a focus that made it worthwhile - a bit more honed than, say, an episode of <i>WTF</i>. Daniel Clowes was a nice addition too, and makes me realise how important the original run of <i>Eightball</i> is to me. I skimmed the tips for writers trying to break into comedy because I'm not particularly interested in that, but the rest of this was brilliant, and I'd happily dig through another volume.<br /><br />

Bissell's latest book is a collection of his various short nonfiction pieces, usually for magazines.

For as probing as the essays about Herzog or Jim Harrison may be, there's also long rants against Robert D. Kaplan. I like Bissell's writing so much that I really enjoyed this, and wished it was longer; luckily, I get to meet him in a few weeks and have that experience to look forward to. I was thrilled to discover a long essay about Tommy Wiseau and <i>The Room</i>, which was actually the highlight of the book for me -- it probably explains the appeal of <i>The Room</i> better than anything else I've read, and better than I could realise it myself. I wanted more on David Foster Wallace but it was perfectly succinct and didn't belabour the point. And the essay on the videogame voiceover artist was surprisingly compelling.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I downloaded the second Lester Bangs collection from libgen while hanging out in O'Hare airport, having forgotten pretty much everything inside in the intervening years. The first section of this is filled with some creative writing from Bangs - stream of consciousness stuff, mostly, describing some horrible experiences drunk at biker parties, etc. The music writing takes up most of this book and at the end there are some more essays about larger themes such as politics, society, and the future of art - but it's all pretty ramshackle. I had forgotten how amazing of a writer Bangs is - not just a masterful stylist but his insight into music is incredible, often cutting to the core of things but managing to balance his opinions with genuine descriptive power. His canonisation in the pantheon of rock criticism is entirely justified, and he's far less 'gonzo' than I actually remembered (though still hilarious and entertaning). A good read throughout - there will be pieces in here I go back to, for sure.<br /><br />

David Peace's Red Riding quartet is a highly-regarded set of grizzled crime fiction in the style of James Ellroy, so when a nice set of all four came into the shop I took a chance on the first one. I was very impressed - this was a compelling, nasty chunk of writing that was more Ellroy-like than I could have imagined. Peace writes in the same short, declarative style, with most paragraphs only one sentence; a minimalism for sure which serves to exacerbate the horror and misery of the tale. The Yorkshire atmosphere adds a level of roughness to everything, and while at times I felt like Peace went out of his way to tell the reader what was on the radio, etc. Whether I will read the others remains to be seen.<br /><br />

 Mason & Dixon: A Novel<br/ >
Thomas Pynchon<br/ >
Source: already owned<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Once again, trying to get through this, the one Pynchon work I've never conquered.;;; Wow, it's finally over. It took me ages, though I would put it down for months, and I never traveled with it (which are the times I get the most reading done, on transit) because it was just too heavy. I read it mostly with the Pynchon wiki alongside but not entirely following it. Unfortunately, this slow method with so many breaks meant that I didn't really get the most out of this - I enjoyed it, greatly, but had trouble staying engaged after going 2 weeks without reading it and then coming back. I think this is Adam's favourite Pynchon novel and I can see why, but I can't say I'd have much appetite to read it again. There was so much to digest and this is not really the place for a proper analysis. Obviously the surveyors' lines and demarcations are the frame on which Pynchon hangs his wonderful, maddening ideas -- thus reflecting man's continual efforts to understand and control the world. This world of Mason and Dixon is so modern, despite being 17th century - while he's not necessarily bothered by anachronisms, the language is really there for him to experiment with, and his erudition is of course unquestioned. But what this really is, is a book about our contemporary life, showing the roots of it all and the lines (yeah?) that traveled into the 20th century. Certainly the aspects of American consumer life are present throughout - food, drink, clothing, technology (for its time) - suggesting that the root of our modern passions is in the founding of America. And there's a lot about race mixed in as well, not just the ugly history of control (which is the eternal Pynchon theme - the preterite/elect and power) but the benevolent flavours shown throughout by all the British, Indonesian, French, Chinese, Swedish, and American characters that pop up. Among all the adventures - the talking animals, saucy 17th century women, ghosts, etc. - is a real warmth, almost as if Pynchon feels more affection for Mason and Dixon than any other characters in his other books. The artifice of this was ultimately so thick that it will scare me away from a re-read (whereas I'm really excited to have another run through the comic-book that is <i>Against the Day</i>) but I'm so, so glad I pushed through. It's also interesting to think about this (and <i>Infinite Jest</i>) being published as perhaps the last great pre-Internet encyclopaedic novels. Though 1997 was of course the Internet age, it was released before the Internet had saturated our lives - yet it emerged as this dense web of information, now naturally suited for things like wikis to be annotating it. That <i>Mason and Dixon</i> is primarily, to me, about our modern life and technology specifically, feels somewhat relevant, though I know that Pynchon didn't intend this to have anything to do with the Internet (in fact, it's easy to imagine him not even knowing about the Internet). Anyway, that's some food for thought and I hope I can remember to take some things from this. But what next?<br /><br />

Men in Space<br/ >
Tom McCarthy<br/ >
Source: Half Price Books, Robinson<br/ >
Cost: $3.99<br/ >
Tom McCarthy's second novel feels like it was put together from notes and written mostly before <i>Remainder</i>. It's lack of focus is the central theme - disjointed, loose characters who occupy the 'space' that is Prague in the early 90s. Throughout the intrigue generated from various seedy plots intersecting, nothing gels, and no characters even emerge as more than mere sketches. Attempting to center this around art shows McCarthy's own background, but it fails to reveal anything about the art world or Prague itself. An atmosphere is definitely created by writing around the story, not just writing the story, but by the final pages I was completely disinterested in anything that had gone before. I appreciate the effort - this feels like something I would have tried to write at some point - but it just doesn't work as a novel.<br /><br />

Cost: $0<br/ >
Mixed feelings about <i>Birdseye Bristoe</i>. I like Zettwoch's work and this is the first really full long thing he's done, but I'm not sure if it added up to much for me. There's lots of what I like about him - getting lost in the details, the diagrams, the minutiae - and this was blended with a nice teenage/midwestern sense of imagination, with pages such as the ice cream/soda drink explanation which are fantastic. But then when adding together into a longer narrative, it felt a bit incoherent. The story was dull and I guess that wasn't the point, but then why bother constructing it at all, if not to have something to hang the details on? The book was printed well and I like the ramshackle-yet-obsessive style he draws in, but as I'm starting to think about shelf space issues, I don't know if this one will survive the next purge.<br /><br />

Abandoned Cars<br/ >
Tim Lane<br/ >
Source: Copacetic<br/ >
Cost: $0<br/ >
Tim Lane's style is formally a bit like Dan Clowes, and he inhabits that same lost-noir sensibility that infused Clowes's earlier work, like the Lloyd Llewellyn series. But where early <i>Eightball</i> is submerged in biting, ironic humour, Lane's stuff is much more serious. The ugly faces and monotonous urban landscapes in this collection are portrayed with an almost wistful longing rather than a misanthropic rant. I'm reminded a little bit of the comic in the liner notes of Sun City Girls' <i>Dante's Disneyland Inferno</i> -- a tough-talking, dark edge of the bar kind of male misery. The little sketches and vignettes of <i>Abandoned Cars</i> are interlaced with weird one-page portraits, characters who never seem to go anywhere and who we are supposed to draw our interpretations from out of the barest of visual clues. The recurring autobiographical piece about jumping a train for no apparent reason is the heart of the collection, as Lane finally turns his lens inward and puts forth something young, yearning and honest (though in hindsight). In the end I wasn't disappointed that I read <i>Abandoned Cars</i> but I'm not sure I would recommend it, or even go back to it.<br /><br />

Big Questions<br/ >
Anders Nilsen<br/ >
Source: Copacetic<br/ >
Cost: $0<br/ >
<i>Big Questions</i> is a real masterpiece of the comic form; a true achievement, and a surprise as well. Being familiar with only his <i>Monologues for the Coming Plague</i> and a few odds and ends, I thought of his work as more conceptual anti-everything absurdist stuff. But <i>Big Questions</i> is a beautiful work of American pastoral comics. The big questions aren't really obvious here - what I thought was going to be 600 pages of birds talking philosophically had so many less words than I expected. Nilsen has no problem ripping off 20 pages of amazing wordless images, and some of the rhythms, particularly the more violent bits, were brilliantly executed. There's a lot of themes at play here, but innocence is an overwhelming one; what is known and not known, by not just the finches of the narrative but by the idiot character, makes a story that is more unsaid than said. Such a simple world is not easy to execute over this duration but Nilsen rises to the challenge - there's a confidence throughout, as well as a mastery of the artform that really surprised me as I thought his style was fairly crude and minimal before. As long-form graphic novels go, this might be one of the best I've ever read - I'm glad I took it as a full-on assault here instead of breaking it up over ten years of individual issues.<br /><br />

Fear and Loathing in America : The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist<br/ >
Hunter S. Thompson<br/ >
Source: Slothrop's<br/ >
Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
I may have enjoyed this more than any other Hunter S. Thompson I've ever read. Being his collected letters from some very vital years in his career, there's a lot of action even though he was too busy to write many letters during some of the more active times in the book - the 72 campaign and his own mayoral attempt. The honesty is astounding - and even though have of this book is HST arguing about money, it's pretty amazing to see how he lived and think about the life of a freelance writer. His relationship with Acosta plays out here - it had really deteriorated by the end of Acosta's life, and the last few letters back and forth are quite sad, both of them shouting at each other over potential movie rights to <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. The fan letters are great, as are his friendships with George McGovern, Pat Buchanan and Jimmy Carter. I suspect these are carefully edited because there isn't actually much about his personal life - his wife lost a baby and that's mentioned, but written around, and there's only passing mentions of his son (though a few letters to his mother and brothers, at least early on). The one annoying thing here was how heavily footnoted this was, with 90% of the footnotes being unnecessary because I already know who Tom Wolfe and Henry Kissinger are. But editorial complaints aside, this was awesome and I'm curious now to read all of the pieces he wrote during this time for various magazines, etc.<br /><br />

I'm so glad that Burns is back with some new work, except it's going to be a long and excruciating process waiting for this all to happen. <i>X'ed Out</i> definitely continues the vibe of <i>Black Hole</i> as there is extremely fucked up imagery crossed with a youth-gone-wild aesthetic; this gets into territory of the unreal that <i>Black Hole</i> only began to hint at, and I think we're in for a wild ride. When reading this I forgot how gross and uneasy Burns's work makes me feel, but that's one of the main draws. The second volume came out a few days after I got this so at least I can devour that soon.<br /><br />

Another rave recommendation from Bill, this took only a few minutes to read but lingered with me a long time after. McNaught's pointillist style is restricted to a two-tone colour palette and this works in almost purely abstract narrative, with a rhythm that is utterly captivating. The small repeating boxes feels like an influence from Chris Ware but I think there's something much more European at work here. There's something almost mystical here, and I'm really bummed that this copy got somewhat water damaged during the trip home because the print fetishist in me adores this package. I should stay up on what McNaught does; he's based in Bristol and feels like a singular voice in the comics world.<br /><br />

I really dug Schrauwen's collection because his style is pretty unique and the stories gave just enough to be thought-provoking without being overly obvious. Visually, Schrauwen's work recalls the Little Nemo comics from 100 years ago, but also makes me thing of Gauguin. The works deal with imagination and the act of creation itself, and can be as austere or psychedelic as necessary. The final chapter felt like the end of an episode of Xavier: Renegade Angel, though there's not much humour or absurdity - instead it's very cerebral, and obtuse while somehow maintaining a playfulness.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
This had been in my parents' basement forever and I brought it back to Estonia figuring I could unload it in the shop. I started reading it and got sucked in by the first few chapters, which are an insanely bizarre blend of fiction and fantasy but in David Toop's style of writing about music - resembling the semi-academic tone of British music writing like <i>The Wire</i>, but with a flair for mysticism. This style disappears as the meat of the book begins - a dissection of the idea of the 'exotic' in music, mostly looking at Les Baxter, Martin Denny, and mid-20th century American pop culture that borrows from Hawaii, Polynesia, etc. The research is good and the tone stays creative throughout, with a constantly shifting focus that is musical itself in format. But it's only at the end when this more experimental tone returns, and only then for brief passages before being interrupted by appendix-style chapters about American blues and the King of Thailand's clarinet record from the 60s. This is really two different books jammed together, but I wish Toop had been able to follow his more colourful impulses even if it would be at the expense of coherence. Also, this has a bunch of interviews in the middle with artists as diverse as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Ornette Coleman, Bill Laswell, and the Boo-Ya Tribe, and none of the interviews really do much to support the book and should have been excised. Still, this has vastly increased my appreciate for David Toop and I think I should check out his more recent works, particularly the last one which sounds great.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;5.91<br/ >
Somehow, I've gone this long without reading Sebald. There was an essay excerpted in my course at Glasgow that dealt with the German repression of WWII, but that's about it. This was marked down super cheap at Apollo and I took a chance on it, as the premise sounded like my kind of thing despite my general fear of post-war Germanic literature as being "too heavy". This was amazing. This was exactly the kind of book I love - something that is between genres, not really literature at all but a rambling travel essay that delves into obscure bits of history. Some of the digressions are quite arcane - silk farming in France in the 1700's, for example - but others are more well known, like the story of young Joseph Conrad. it's really personal, as if he's writing about his experiences through the lens of these historical figures - and I think the blurb on the back put it best when it called the book "long-distance mental travel". As someone who's been missing the UK a lot lately, the East Anglia seaside walks were lovely and I also loved how freely associating it was - the historical narratives were often indistinguishable from Sebald's own voice, an interesting technique that really pulls you into things. I'm probably going to read everything he wrote now.<br /><br />

A Naked Singularity: A Novel<br/ >
Sergio De La Pava<br/ >
Source: Rahva Raamat<br/ >
Cost: &euro;15.99<br/ >
The much-heralded <i>A Naked Singularity</i> was pretty gripping - I tore through the last 300 pages in one night, unable to put it down, not wanting it to end. And end it does. The acceleration towards a conclusion (even if it's inconclusive) is unsatisfying not in a traditional narrative sense, but because it feels so rushed and I wanted so much more. I'm sure this is getting tons of comparisons to David Foster Wallace, and it's hard to deny the influence. This is most obvious in the long conversations, which veer into irrelevant digressions yet still contain the honesty that Wallace's writing does. But de la Pava is not as careful or calculating as Wallace, often letting bizarre jokes take over (which aren't always successful) and not creating as complete of a world of real/surreal/hyperreal/whatever. I think I read this compared to <i>The Wire </i>somewhere too, and certainly the machinations of the criminal justice system are complex and the question of morality is every bit at the centre of this book as it is in the TV series. But while <i>The Wire</i> attempts to indict the entire American society as culpable in the destruction of itself, <i>A Naked Singularity</i> stays with one character. While there are certainly pointed, political moments in this book (the war on drugs is not treated kindly, nor is the death penalty),  it's Casi's own compassion here, the heart and soul and what compelled me to keep reading. I would maybe quibble that Casi's mental dissolution and his complicity in the caper are not really connected to anything concrete - I think de la Pava is vaguely suggesting that a combination of many cultural and financial things are at play, such as workpress pressure, television/popular culture, and/or romantic emotional duress. Regardless, this is a fantastic, stunning debut novel and I anxiously await whatever he produces next.<br /><br />

Cost: &euro;0<br/ >
Ted loaned me this book which I thought was going to be about the lives of early/seminal blues musicians. Instead I found a fascinating chronicling of the white scholars, collectors and enthusiasts responsible for popularising blues music in the mid-20th century - so it's a book about the meta-blues. This was actually far more interesting to me, especially as the false quest for 'authenticity' was even more prevalent then. The anthropologists, archivists and collectors described here are all fascinating and Hamilton does a really good amount of research into their lives, and most importantly their attitudes. Many of their approaches were insanely racist or at least problematic, and even in the 40's it's interesting to see how they dealt with these charges. The final chapter, on fanatic blues collector James McKuen, was probably the most interesting to me because it made me think about the subculture my father was part of during his teenage years, though off by a decade or so. Not nearly as much biographical info was available on McKuen as, say, John Lomax, so it's a bit shorter than the other chapters and ends abruptly, but it's great anyway.<br /><br />

The only Fante I read before was <i>Ask the Dust</i>, probably when I was 16 or 17, but I always had a soft spot for his him in my mind. Despite the fact he influenced Bukowski so much (which isn't his fault) I loved <i>Ask the Dust</i> and now, 16 years later, was similarly impressed by <i>Wait Until Spring, Bandini</i>. As I'm currently applying for Italian citizenship, it was timely and topical to read about Italian-American bricklayers in America in the first half of the century. Fante's style is clean and simple, clearly why he was an influence on the Beats (or maybe the missing link between Hemingway and them), and it made the perspective shifts between different family members feel coherent. The juxtaposition of adult and adolescent drama worked, but it was really the writing - stark, strong, and balanced on an emotional edge - that carried this through. I should check out the rest of the quartet some day.<br /><br />

I thought this last collection of DFW non-fiction would be scraping the bottom of the barrel, but it wasn't, and when I saw it in the shop I couldn't resist. Besides, I'm sure they'll find more stuff out there and we'll get some real barrel-scrapings in the near future. About 1/3 of this I had read before, such as the great Terminator 2 essay and the Federer piece, which is considered his non-fiction masterpiece though I'm not sure why (it's excellent, but short and I think he's written a lot better). One of the longest pieces in here was a detailed analysis of <i>Wittgenstein's Mistress</i> which was the high point for me, as I'm a massive fan of Markson's novel so reading DFW's take was actually thrilling. And it's not often that someone describes reading a book review as thrilling. The usual bout of sadness I feel when reading him now wasn't there, not just because these were mostly light pieces, but because I think I'm at the point now where I can enjoy his work without being overcome by that. The section about grammar was actually helpful to me, and the short piece on sexuality in the time of AIDS was possibly the most insightful thing he ever wrote about human relations. The only essay that dragged a bit for me was the look at math-based fiction, but 14 out of 15 is a pretty winning rate.<br /><br />

I was very impressed with this, which I started reading very slowly (sad, but I have given no time for books the past few weeks) and then devoured in sudden rampage. Knowing as much about Lethem as I do, I expected this to be more Philip K Dick style sci-filings, and certainly there was a Dickish (?) core here. But the prose unfolded to be an introspective, yearning book about lost love that was more drenched with the personal than at first glance. Some passages reminded me of DeLillo, but the warm, beautiful DeLillo I rarely can find. The quirkiness which the opening chapters hinted at quickly falls away and this turns into something painful, yet hopeful.<br /><br />

Some of the descriptive passages were stunning, though, and he managed to create really complex characters with few words, and all filtered through such a distinct first-person narrative. I re-read this because there's a new collection of his miscellaneous writings available but it will be some time before I order a copy (or find it locally); thus, I'm trying to revisit the books I read some years ago. I don't think I was in the right mindset for this, however -- I've been too preoccupied to dive into books lately, which is a shame and something I hope to correct when the clouds clear.<br /><br />

Stop-Time: A Memoir<br/ >
Frank Conroy<br/ >
Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $10.95<br/ >
Conroy's memoir is fantastic; he wrote it while fairly young, so it covers life until he began college. As someone who thinks (often) about autobiography being often a trap, Conroy managed to write something beautiful as well as compelling, despite having nothing particularly eventful in his upbringing. This is no <i>Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</i> - though there are some complications, such as his father dying young and disharmony between his stepfather and mother, Conroy was not a particularly troubled child. But he weaves a beautiful portrait from episodes, presented in an irregular sequences, of adventures such as becoming a yo-yo champion to smoking cigarettes in his boarding school. The most compelling passage is in the centre, where he runs away, attempting to hitchhike to Florida, at fifteen; I realised I love stories where people go on the run without understanding why and then return. The appearance of serious mental illness in his sister, coming at the very end of the book, opens up the possibility of some real darkness, but then it ends -- leaving a strange, hanging feeling. The hangover of innocent adolescence, perhaps?<br /><br />

America's Magic Mountain<br/ >
Curtis White<br/ >
Source: Amazon US<br/ >
Cost: $21.07<br/ >
Price includes shipping + customs fees.  Could have gotten this for like 3 cents secondhand, but with all the shipping factored in from the rest of the order, this was just the same.;; Another Curtis White novel, which like <i>Requiem</i> and <i>The Idea of Home</i> is fairly freewheeling, though this at least tries to adhere to a plot. Stylistically I was reminded of <i>Darconville's Cat</i>, for the small-town setting, frustrating erudition and emphasis on tangents was exactly the same style. This is a big parody of Thomas Mann's <i>The Magic Mountain</i> which I've never read, though I can't say I really want to. I thought this would just be a plot device on which White would throw his views on American culture in the hopes that some would stick, but it wasn't even really that focused. It was funny, at points, but so random and disorganised that I failed to stay engaged. I really like White and was disappointed by this only because I don't think he let it play out enough - it's a great setup for a plot and had a few genius passages, but felt somewhat rushed.<br /><br />

Cosmos and Pornografia: Two Novels<br/ >
Witold Gombrowicz<br/ >
Source: Eljay's Used Books, Dormont, PA<br/ >
Cost: $4<br/ >
I never read Gombrowicz before and knew he was a Polish absurdist, but I didn't expect this to be so dream-like and engrossing. <i>Cosmos</i> sucked me in by constructing a first-person narration built around mundane, mysterious things. His style is elliptical, yet realistic - there's a lot of long list-like runs of nouns (a common trait I find among writers I like) and I'm wondering if he was a bit of an influence on Nicholson Baker's fiction. As the novel progresses, it gets darker and darker, culminating in something confusingly deranged that I didn't expect in the slightest - yet still, sort of it's about 'nothing'. There's a lot of mystery in here, none of which adds up to anything, which is precisely why it's so great. This translation was re-translated by combining the French and German translations, and while it sufficed, I'm curious about the newer, direct-from-Polish translation which is what I'll find if I ever re-read this. Lots of potential for use in action-based performance/non-performance collaborations, as this whole 'search for meaning' thing is wonderfully deconstructed. [4 February 2013]<br /><br />

Insurmountable Simplicities: Thirty-nine Philosophical Conundrums<br/ >
Roberto Casati & Achille Varzi<br/ >
Source: Rahva Raamat<br/ >
Cost: &euro;6<br/ >
This was a cheap pickup from the discount rack but proved to be rather disappointing because I expected it to be thought-provoking in a completely different manner to the way that it was. These 'philosophical inquiries' were little vignettes about logic, contradictions and paradoxes -- mind games, and hypothetical situations, that were sort of fun at first but dragged as it went on. Most of these were so abstract that they resembled a child's riddles, and the interstitial excursions into 'philosophy' were so brief that even though I wanted pop-philosophy, it wasn't enough. This made me want to re-read <i>Metamagical Themas</i> instead, which has been sitting on my shelf unopened for the past 15 years or so. So maybe it's time for that; this, however, will be relegated to the sell pile.<br /><br />
