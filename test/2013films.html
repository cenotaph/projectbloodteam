Best Worst Movie<br />Michael Stephenson, USA , 2009<br />Location: Terje's place<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />I started to watch <i>Troll 2</i>, but only made it through about 15 minutes. I'm sure it's a blast but that's the type of film I should be watching with other people while in a drinking/social/party environment. So I decided to watch the documentary about it<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>instead. This started off by being an portrait of annoying fans who love it to the point of obsession, and I'm not really interested in the cult/irony sensibilities. But then we meet the director, who genuinely thought it was a good film, and we start to see the sadness behind this film, most obviously in the lead female actress who is leading a sad, reclusive life now. The main actor-turned-dentist who <i>Best Worst Movie</i> mostly revolves around is just so awesome, wonderful and enthusiastic that I stayed with this, even though his regret is not even hidden. His personality is so genuine that I left this feeling quite nice, though in a totally different way than I expected it to affect me. I will eventually watch the rest of <i>Troll 2</i> but probably not any time soon.<br /><br />25 December 2012<br />The Saddest Music in the World<br />Guy Maddin, \nCanada , 2003<br />Location: Terje's place<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Deeper into Guy Maddin. <i>Keyhole </i>is still very fresh in my mind, so I probably approached this with those themes resonating: internal psychology, fantastic allegory, dark and disturbing family issues. Some of that was definitely at play here, and Isabella Rossellini was here in a similar role, but <i>The Saddest Music in the World</i> played out its narrative machinations in a public context. Maddin's stylised B&amp;W grain is perfect for setting the atmosphere of a Depression-era Winnipeg, and I found the outdoor scenes surrounded by snow and wooden houses to be the most inspiring. Mark McKinney's Chester is slippery, never quite clear to the viewer, and the musical numbers are surprisingly successful. I think Maddin was trying to address the issue of Canada's own multiculturalism, but maybe this is naive comment to make, since I really don't know much about the Canadian social dynamics. I think I preferred the darker, eating-its-own-tail "logic" of <i>Keyhole</i> (as well as the eroticism which was much less evident here) but this was still enjoyable.<br /><br />25 December 2012<br />In Bruges<br />Martin McDonagh, UK / Belgium , 2008<br />Location: Terje's place<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />I was curious to see how McDon`gh's other work holds up to <i>Seven Psychopaths</i> but this was pretty disappointing in comparison. The main difference was in the humour - this just wasn't very funny, though it tried, and it was so uneven that I found myself really getting bored and hoping it would end. I'm not really into the whole British gangster/hitman genre and this tries to deconstruct it and slow it down, but ultimately just relies on the same tired shootouts that it is supposedly critiquing. Perhaps if Sam Rockwell was in this, I would have been more into it.<br /><br />01 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Rum Diary<br />Bruce Robinson, USA , 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I had low expectations for <i>The Rum Diary</i> and this was appropriately mediocre. There was a lot of promise here, with Bruce Robinson returning to the director's chair and writing the script, which he should have been good at - Thompson's mad style was captured in <i>Withnail and I</i>, and also <i>How To Get Ahead In Advertising</i>; and his screenplay of <i>The Killing Fields</i> shows that Robinson can certainly navigate the complexities of imperialism and journalism. But none of this came through in the final product, which was if anything, just a bit dull. It wasn't the complete Johnny Depp vanity project I had heard it was. His character was just a watered down version of his <i>Fear and Loathing</i> shtick and I don't think Depp is much to blame for this being so limp-dicked. To say something good about this, the Puerto Rican setting was captured well, as the feeling of imminent capitalist exploitation was conveyed in the smaller scenes (and less successfully through the caricatured banker types). To say something negative: I really would consider this one of the worst possible films, because it was just dull, which as we have discussed before, gives it a low rating on an absolute value scale, even if it's technically a positive score.<br /><br />02 January 2013<br />(Untitled)<br />Jonathan Parker, USA , 2009<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />David Rothenberg recommended <i>(Untitled)</i> to me, which was difficult to find a torrent for due to its name. I expected this to be some heavy meditation about art and commerce but found a comedy which, as the film went on, grew on me more and more until the slightly unsatisfying climax. The gallerist who is the center of the plot is certainly portrayed negatively, but not in a completely inhuman way; likewise, the caricatured 'tortured avant-garde composer' and 'dot-com millionnaire dilettante' and all the hilarious artist stereotypes are more than just cartoons. <i>(Untitled)</i> walks a very difficult line- it lampoons the worst excesses of art, but from a perspective that is informed and realistic. Maybe it mirrors my own frustrations, but like <i>Nathan Barley</i>, or <i>Portlandia</i>, this was cathartic to see, even if the targets are so easy to hit. I've certainly met a lot of people over the years that are even beyond the artists in this film (<i>Barley</i>'s 15Peter20 has been long-cited between friends of mine as a symbol of so many others we know) but this also tried to touch upon the genuine struggles of creative expression in the marketplace. Really, this was shockingly good for a fairly light-hearted mainstream film. And the composer's works which were meant to be alienating and ridiculous sounded like about 20% of my record collection and I thought it was all totally great. And this very realistically deals with the age-old struggle of how experimental visual art is received (and financially supported) while sound art and music is not; I think that conversation, with David, is originally why he recommended this.<br /><br />04 January 2013<br />Αλπεις<br />Giorgos Lanthimos, Greece , 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I had high expectation after <i>Kynodontas</i>, but <i>Alpeis</i> is a much different beast. Lanthimos retains his ability to creep out the viewer with odd, unsettling human interactions (and some of the most horrifyingly awkward sex scenes ever). Like the preceding film, this relied on a strange conceit to drive the plot. But where <i>Kynodontas </i>had a powerful enough narrative that any human emotions hung on it were shocking and compelling, this took a more low-key approach. File next to <i>Holy Motors</i> - odd to watch these so close together - but <i>Alpeis</i> was much more concerned with rhythm and mood than continuing to keep the viewer engaged with the narrative. I didn't dislike this, but it left me wanting more, not because it was so great, but because it felt like something was lacking.<br /><br />09 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Bernie<br />Richard Linklater, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Linklater's <i>Bernie</i> wasn't a bad way to pass the time but I was left wondering why I bothered. This was low-key entertainment, for sure, but it didn't push anything and let light, easy storytelling dominate. At its best moments, it touched on ideas of companionship, economic dependency, and fear, but mostly it was interrupted by Linklater's faux-documentary structure. This structure actually kept things moving, but became so bogged down in the folksy colloquialisms that I lost interest halfway through. I am continually surprised at how much I enjoy Matthew McConaughey, who dominated this film; it's probably the best I have ever seen him. Despite all of the singing, Black managed to keep his personality repressed enough that I could enjoy this, and I think he would have been a better fit in <i>The Campaign</i> than Galifianakis was, if he had just done this. Ultimately I wasn't that interested in the plot and the near-fetishisation of small-town Texas seemed almost disrespectful and exploitative at points.<br /><br />09 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Celeste &#x26; Jesse Forever<br />Lee Toland Krieger, USA , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />What seemed to be another film about the romantic struggles of white people surprised me; perhaps it was due to parallels with personal things in my life right now, but I found this surprisingly affecting. I'm no fan of Rashida Jones but I have to admit she gave an impressive performance here, managing to bring empathy to an unlikeable character without ever actually dropping her insecurities; the script also managed to sell the intimacy and history of her and Andy Samberg in just a few opening minutes of interacting. While the near-obsessive display of iPhones, iPads, Facebook and other hallmarks of the zeitgeist were annoying (and will make this film horribly dated in a few years), the pop-culture/media-obsessed young Americans portrayed in this film really are the types who are influencing American culture so much right now. While I feel insanely distant from it all, I still managed to connect to something. While the central question of the film - 'Do you want to be right or to be happy?' is asked overtly, there aren't easy answers here and the film ends appropriately, rejecting the love-conquers-all desire that it managed to even instill in me. For a supposed comedy it wasn't particularly funny, but the plot was so heavy (a good move, I think) that I was carried along anyway. A few of the scenes were done so artfully that this might actually be a great film - one that works within a tired genre and succumbs to the trappings of contemporary screenwriting, yet somehow transcends it all. Or maybe I just watched this at the right (wrong?) time. Either way, it was an hour and 40 minutes well-spent.<br /><br />11 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    This Is 40<br />Judd Apatow, USA , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />OK - so I didn't think this would be good, and it confirmed that each Apatow-helmed film is worse than the last one. But this one was <i>really</i> bad, without anything to redeem it except for Albert Brooks. Apatow could probably learn from being a bit more self-conscious about his writing, which is odd because in an conversation I listened to between him and Alec Baldwin last week, Apatow talked about how Brooks contributed a lot of suggestions to the script and Apatow is happy to listen to the opinions of others. So who greenlighted this? I wanted to see some really dark marital issues worked out here, but it took zero risks. He cast his own kids, which was mostly awful, and made the two main characters genuinely fucked up people but not interesting in their fuckedupness - there nothing worthwhile in their bizarre interactions, only vulgarity. Apatow also said in that interview that he allows a fair bit of ad-libbing in his films, which made me wonder if these were the only parts that were funny. Leslie Mann is annoying as usual, though I will credit her with being able to carry the lead role; her interactions with the kids were natural, since she's actually their mother, but I really could have done without the unnecessary cute child scenes. Facebook is the place to show off your kids, not a 140-minute long film. I put this on to fall asleep to but amazingly lasted through it, even though I didn't enjoy any of it. When seeing members of the Philadelphia Flyers is a high point, you know you're in trouble. Like <i>Funny People</i>, Apatow seems focused on trying to show off as many celebrity cameos as possible, and building a subplot around Graham Parker and the Rumour is just plain weird. Rudd felt like he was on autopilot throughout most of the film and his performance gave zero insight into marriage's many complexities. Throughout the film Mann and Rudd fight, then agree they love each other and stop fighting, and then start again a few scenes later. By the end we're supposed to believe that some peace has been reached because he gets into a bike accident, but I've been married too and I know how things work out. At least undercut this with the real darkness! The characterisation of Rudd as an out-of-touch rock and roll beta male, desperately clinging to opportunities to eat cupcakes and cheeseburgers behind his wife's back, is pandering and lazy writing, too. For once I'd like to see a real relationship on screen, where the problems can be philosophical instead of surface bullshit; where a couple can trust and support each other and focus on serious things. But this is Apatow's vision, and all of his films are basically about trying to balance growing up with their constructed identity. His career is like one man remaking <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> over and over until it collapses under poop and vagina jokes. I'm done; I'd take no more of his work but since I download all this shit anyway and it's so easy to watch, I'm sure I'll subject myself to his next film, which will probably be a 170-minute long exploration of sexual dysfunction starring Jonah Hill and Aziz Ansari in 2015.<div><br/></div><br /><br />15 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Silver Linings Playbook<br />David O. Russell, USA , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />What's happened to David O. Russell? Can this really be the guy who made films as invigorating and daring as <i>Three Kings</i> and <i>Huckabees</i>? Once again I'm left disappointed by a turn towards storybook, fairytale ending - without a trace of irony, this basically turned into <i>The Fighter</i>. To be honest, my cards were stacked against it from the beginning, as it combines two of my most hated themes - the 'screwed-up people find each other' romance and the 'white people dancing conquers all' genre. The first hour of the film actually started out as a reasonably well-done investigation into mental illness which didn't trivialise it (because it's a very, very sad situation), showed the hereditariness of it, and suggested that there's plenty of problems in so-called normal people too. Watching Cooper and Lawrence interacting at the beginning showed a lot of promise, but once they go to the Eagles game, the film completely jumps the shark. The characters were written well, as this lowbrow Eastern city culture is something that was started in <i>The Fighter</i> but is a whole other can of worms in Philly. The most interesting aspect of Cooper's predicament is the reality of it, as I know there are many Americans in his socioeconomic status who have similar mental issues and become stuck in a (often undiagnosed, or overdiagnosed/overmedicated) loop. There could be some real pain to explore here, but instead Russell chose to take the love story route and put in this absolutely ridiculous wager plotline to give it some Hollywood resolution. As a portrayal of an Italian-American family, it was realistic at least from my own experience, though I think DeNiro's superstitions were a bit overplayed, though DeNiro, who is basically a bad actor at this point, worked as such, because his paternal behaviours were written to be unconvincing and only delivered through the lens of sports fandom. I guess this is the type of film Russell wants to make, which is fine, but it's sad that he's going for easy Oscar nominations instead of critiquing the mental health industry in America (it's subtle, but Cooper starts getting his shit together once he starts taking his medication).<br /><br />15 January 2013<br />Django Unchained<br />Quentin Tarantino, USA , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />This was so long. It really could have been split into two films, like he did with <i>Kill Bill</i>, except <i>Kill Bill </i>sucked and probably the reason was that he dragged something lightweight into two films. This was just as lightweight despite having the gravitas of dealing with slavery. As much as it turned into a somewhat predictable bloodbath, I found the first half incredibly entertaining. Christoph Waltz remains one of most magnetic presences on the screen and it was nice to find him playing a good guy for once. Despite his cartoonish character he was the momentum that kept me engaged, even if it's a far cry from his performance in <i>Carnage</i>. I would complain about the bizarre tone shifts and anachronisms, except that is very much the point - Tarantino is so focused on reconstructing his influences that it takes a bit of soul out of his films. At times I thought of <i>Casa di mi padre</i> for some reason. This was certainly fun throughout as all perfectly assembled pastiches are; in the hands of a more ambitious filmmaker it might have actually fallen somewhat short simple by having a higher bar. I really should see <i>Addio zio Tom</i> since it's been on my list for a decade.<br /><br />18 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Kill List<br />Ben Wheatley, UK , 2011<br />Location: Terje's dad's place<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />I think <i>Kill List</i> was awesome, or maybe stupid. It resembled a Canadian film called <i>The Conspiracy</i> which I recently saw but I didn't think it would at all. I watched this with headphones on as Terje was editing in the same room, so I was hyperaware of the sound mix, which I would even say was a bit overdone - but maybe this is not the case at all, and the headphones just amplified the effects. There seemed to be a constant presence of a television in the domestic scenes, and some of the dialogue was so mumbled and quiet that I'm actually really glad I had the close speaker presence. This seemed to mash up a lot of genres well, keeping a consistent tone, and had some very stylised editing which set the mood completely. This editing style had a lot of uneven jump cuts, really calling attention to the artifice of the medium, and making even the most mundane moments seem unsettling. The conspiracy element of the plot creeps in very slowly, with just a few hints to be enticing. I think I'm predisposed to like British cinema, and I maybe give it more of a pass - for some reason the brutal violence in this didn't bother me nearly as much as it would in an American film. The climactic moments were filmed mostly in CantTellWhatTheFuckIsGoingOn-o-Vision, which usually annoys me in edgy films, but worked here. But by the end I'm not completely sure what I've seen, except I like being confused so I liked this in the end.<br /><br />21 January 2013<br />Phase 7<br />Nicol&#xE1;s Goldbart, Argentina , 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I somewhat misread that this would be a 'zombie comedy' type of film, which it wasn't, which is good since that genre doesn't interest me. I don't know why I watched this - it was a claustrophobic thriller, set in a Buenos Aires apartment building, and with a somewhat uneven tone which reminded me almost of a Troma film in ways. This was really slow, and the sense of space made it pretty uncomfortable to watch, but I didn't find it engaging in the slightest, and the New World Order/disease theme was only partially explained which seemed more sloppy than deliberately ambiguous. Argentinean cinema sorta interests me, but i'm not sure why - not everything is going to be <i>Historias Extraordinarias</i>.<br /><br />21 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Sleepwalk with Me<br />Mike Birbiglia, Seth Barrish, USA , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />This was all a bit too <i>nice</i>. Birbiglia is an interesting comedian and I think he manages to carry the film, but the whole <i>This American Life</i>-style production made it another film about creative white people dealing with relationship issues. If you took the sleep disorder out of this film, it would be unwatchable and pedestrian, but at least they got to shoot some Fellini-style dream sequences. Though, apart from the dustbuster olympics, these weren't so impressive. The interesting part of the story to me is how Birbiglia found his voice as a comedian, learning how to write about his life and "own" his material. But this is rather washed over in the film as a simple epiphany moment (cause Marc Maron tells him to) rather than an introspective journey. My favourite part was the hallucination of the sleep scientist in his car, and how whenever he spoke, it sounded like his voice was coming out of a dictaphone. A few laughs here and there, and maybe it's commendable that it kept the humour restrained, but I was pretty bored overall.<br /><br />22 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Sound of My Voice<br />Zal Batmanglij, USA , 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I was so into this until the very end; I think stylistically, it was fantastic - perfect balance between light and heavy, visually clean but with the creepy cult feeling, and just enough ambiguity to drive it along. The ending wasn't a cop out, but such an obvious place to stop that I actually felt like the writers couldn't commit to a viewpoint. The protagonist (or whatever he was supposed to be) was marvelously weasely, and the scene with the hidden camera that he swallowed was actually a pretty intense but of filmmaking. I like work that attacks gurus and spirituality, and I think this did, despite what the ending might suggest; at the same time, new age movements often lead to useful questions and new perspectives, if you only know where to draw the boundaries (and most people don't). I guess this was technically a film about time travel though it doesn't actually feature any.<br /><br />22 January 2013<br />Rushmore<br />Wes Anderson, \nUSA , 1998<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />It seemed crazy that she had never seen a Wes Anderson film so we did a drunken 2AM viewing of <i>Rushmore</i>, which was so hilarious and exhilarating that I didn't fall asleep during it. So hooray for me. Lots of fun as always, and it's crazy to think this was made 15 years ago.<br /><br />23 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Jess + Moss<br />Clay Jeter, USA , 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I feel like I should write many words about <i>Jess + Moss</i> because I was so impressed with this, which is one of the most audacious American films I have seen in years. It's fairly non-narrative but not quite an experimental feature film - but it relies heavily on 16mm footage and cassette tape manipulations (sounding, at points, as if the Bohman Brothers did the sound mix) so it tickles my analogue fetishes. But besides the engrossing visual and aural beauty of this, which was almost unparalleled in anything I've seen in recent years, there was the setting of the film itself. It occupies a midwestern or Southern American past that felt so real, I almost had <i>dejá vu </i>watching it. I didn't actually grow up anywhere near this world but my own youth, spent playing outside at the lake or otherwise, enjoying those aimless explorations and pre-adolescent curiosity, was hit on so realistically I felt like i was really transported not just into the world, but into the characters themselves. The experimental collage effect might not be for everyone, though. Brakhage-style experimental film and that film <i>Gallivant</i> were certainly influences, but then this also resembled some contemporary music video work. But where most directors would feel the pressure to graft a clear, directed narrative onto these impressions, Jeter did a great job in resisting accessibility. He just riffs here, and there's enough substance and drama to piece together some real tension, but without being game-like or trick-based. So many of the films I've been into for the past few years have relied on excellent child acting and this was no exception - it's hard to fathom how Jeter could get these performances from these tweens, especially for someone so focused on art-house aesthetics. There's as much humanity in this as a Cassavetes film (and I noticed the production company was called <i>Love Streams</i>), as much awe and grandeur as early Terence Malick, and yet something incredibly contemporary and singular about this vision. I will be excited if not obsessed with seeing what Jeter does next.<br /><br />23 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Oslo, August 31st<br />Joachim Trier, Norway , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br /><i>Oslo, 31. August</i> was so bathed in melancholy that it was like a familiar friend. Though I've never been a drug addict or lived in Oslo, the steady, calm pace and compassionate performances made this seem incredibly relatable. Danielsen Lie is stunning, managing to inhabit a character who got the right degree of sympathy from me. The city of Oslo comes to life here, with the shots of cafes, street corners and trams becoming almost a city-protagonist. Despite the heavy, sad nature of this film I didn't find this to be over the top of depressing - but again, melancholic, a place that is somewhat welcoming.<br /><br />23 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One<br />William Greaves, USA , 1968<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />This is something I will probably use if I run any more workshops about performance, as I've never seen anything quite like it. It's an enigma, a mystery wrapped up in itself, yet so obvious because there's nothing to hide. Greaves was so brilliant and ahead of his time in making this that I find it incredible he even tried to get it a theatrical release at the time, as I can't see any way this would be palatable to audiences. It's impossible to unravel how much of this is performance and how much is 'real'; in addition, this addresses race and homosexuality quite bluntly, again remarkable for its time, if ambiguous in how it deals with things. Greaves himself reminds me a little bit of Albert Brooks in <i>Real Life</i>, only not as over-the-top because it really isn't clear at any point how much he knew what he was doing and how much of this was just him stumbling around. It's remarkable how something so overtly metafictional can also be transparent in construction, and funny/entertaining to watch too.<br /><br />24 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Silver Tongues<br />Simon Arthur, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />Dark, indeed, and I genuinely didn't know where this was going. It had a few genuine surprises, and if it was an uneven film overall, it was fucked up enough to be minorly compelling. This has shades of <i>Holy Motors</i> and <i>The Comedy</i> though much darker (and slower); I thought the acting was pretty good, with the leads being oddly recognisable from TV work and wonderful slimy. The lead actress was the most slippery, as I could never quite tell what her true motivation was, and if the events of <i>Silver Tongues </i>are just a cross-section of an longer, elaborate game -- then that is truly exciting.<br /><br />24 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Paradise: Love<br />Ulrich Seidl, Austria / Germany / France , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />What an intense trip! I actually thought this was a documentary for the first half-hour, because I had somehow confused it in my mind with something else. This led to a even more bizarre perception of the film, which makes me very curious to see more of Seidl's work. A film about sex tourism wouldn't normally interest me, but since the gender roles were inverted, it became a lot more curious. And casting a dumpy, overweight middle-aged woman as the protagonist meant this could focus on actually exploring the nature of desire instead of being mere titillation. Visually, this was magnificent - the Kenyan beaches were portrayed in such a vivid colour palette that all of the scenarios became surreal, and when contrasted with the dingy interiors of the men's accommodations, they seemed even more artificial. I've always wondered what goes on in the minds of horny, middle-aged Austrian women, and their antics were as exploitative as typical male sex tourists; yet the film wasn't about sex at all, but rather the commodification of ones self, as exemplified by the numerous scenes of touts hawking necklaces and other cheap tourist crap. Because I'm a completist, I'll probably see the other two films in this series though I've heard iffy things about <i>Paradise: Faith</i>.<br /><br />24 January 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Watch<br />Akiva Schaffer, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />As mediocre as I expected. Saw the twist coming from the beginning, and it wasn't even much of a twist. Stiller seems to be trying a little harder than he usually does for a film that he didn't direct, and Vaughan was actually funny for once. But as usual, this relied on easy R-rated sexual innuendo and tired racial stereotypes. Will Forte was actually the best thing about this.<br /><br />24 January 2013<br />Humpday<br />Lynn Shelton, USA , 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />If I have been receptive to the whole 'mumblecore' genre in the past, consider me an unabashed fan now. <i>Humpday</i> was so excellent that it justifies the entire conceit of this film 'movement', if it even is a movement (and I don't think it really is, but more a media construction). I couldn't have enjoyed this more. The premise could have been a bullshit Kevin Smith plot, except it was handled realistically and with first-rate acting. Duplass has never been better, and the deep friendship with Joshua Leonard is powerful and convincing. This manages to dive into issues of friendship, masculinity, homophobia, commitment, fear and trust without oversimplifying anything or getting into film-cliché. That it was written by a woman is even more impressive - I don't know if some of the dialogue was improvised or not, but the interactions between the characters in this film possessed a deep truth, which the art of cinema is exemplary at illuminating. The handheld, blurry camera and uneven sound mix accentuates the honesty here, like the best of the Dogme95 films (of which mumblecore is essentially an American version, right?). Rather than being obfuscated for obfuscation's sake, <i>Humpday</i>'s stylistic construction is designed for maximum impact and total comprehension of the medium. And, it was funny - hilariously so, without being constructed. I'm going to seek out the rest of Shelton's work now.<br /><br />25 January 2013<br />Superheroes<br />Mike Barnett, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />This was what it was - a documentary exploring the lives of 'real-life superheroes', meaning people across North America who don spandex costumes and take to the streets to fight crime. It could have been a lot worse - I feared something Spurlock-y, but instead it took a fairly neutral position. It would have been easy for the filmmaker to belittle these people, but it was easy enough to let them do it themselves. The different people in <i>Superheroes</i> -- and there are a lot of them -- vary greatly in levels of competence and delusion. We never see them actually accomplish much, and get some flustered interviewed with proper law enforcement officials, who are way too tolerant of these fools. The Orlando-based guy who drinks cans of Busch out of the back of his crime-stopping van is by far the most over the top and depressing, but the openly-gay kid in Brooklyn had a great deal of humanity to him, which made me feel even worse that he's living such a misguided fantasy. The bit near the end about all the charity work some of them do hints at some genuine benefit that comes out of these efforts, but the majority of their actions are empty posturing and the occasional attempt at entrapment. Not as much as I would have liked delving into their personality problems and upbringings (this would have benefited more from having less superheroes being profiled and more depth) but I guess this was quite watchable in my flu-ridden haze.<br /><br />25 January 2013<br />Baghead<br />Jay Duplass, Mark Duplass, USA , 2008<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />The Duplass brothers made a horror movie! Kind of. I didn't enjoy <i>Baghead</i> as much as their other films though it was still engaging. It was maybe a bit too much of a victim of its own plot, which I wasn't that interested in, and the meta- aspects of ambitious young Hollywood outsiders trying to write films were a bit distant to me. The last scene, in the hospital, was drawn out in a somewhat irritating manner, but maybe I'm just nitpicking - this was still an enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />25 January 2013<br />The King of Comedy<br />Martin Scorsese, USA , 1982<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I haven't seen this in over a decade, and that was an old VHS copy rented from Heads Together. This was a flop when it was released, but I think it's been re-evaluated lately. I had fond memories of it, and it was pretty much as I recalled - a very dark, often painful study of fame obsession with no overt comedy whatsoever. The only actual humour is found in DeNiro and Lewis's mannerisms, and if you find desperation funny. Which I do! Sandra Bernhard is wonderfully deranged, especially in the scene where she follows Lewis through the city, and her attempted seduction of him was much funnier than I remembered. But is this a masterpiece? It's probably DeNiro's best performance, that I've seen, in anything; and kudos to Scorcese for resisting the impulse to make it funnier.  But I would have liked more investigation into the art o comedy. If anything, I'm more interested in the "in-between" celebrity-obsessed people. It's not the stalkers who are the problem - they are the outliers - but the types of people who, as my father once put it, have lives "so bereft of meaning" that they do things like hang out outside of the Michael Jackson trial, etc. Maybe American culture has changed significantly since 1982, in that celebrity-worship has become more saturated into normality.<br /><br />13 February 2013<br />Le Samoura&#xEF;<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France / Italy , 1967<br />Location: M/S Victoria, cabin 5606<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br />I'm gonna try to watch more Jean-Pierre Melville films so I threw this and <i>Le Doulos</i> on my laptop for the trip, but the latter only had Spanish subtitles, so <i>Le Samouraï </i>it was. Of course, this was great - the most compelling segments were without dialogue, and it was placed midway between being a gangster film and a police procedural. Melville chose to use multiple perspectives which made this a great game of cat-and-mouse -- intriguing to watch, as I was rooting for the killer. The interrogation sequence at the police station has the most amazing sequences of the inspector going through various modernist doorways, from room to room, in a section I'll probably watch over and over and maybe even use in some projects. This was an iffy print so I didn't feel as dazzled by the colours as I did with <i>Le Cercle Rouge</i>, but the last 1/3 was essentially Paris Métro porn, and using Chatelet to evade cops is so logical since that station is so confusing and too-big.<br /><br />03 February 2013<br />Persona<br />Ingmar Bergman, Sweden , 1966<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on projector<br />A close friend anti-recommended this to me, warning me that it would fuck me up because of parallels to my own life. Of course, this is just like begging me to watch it, so I did, but I didn't find any such parallels. Still, of course, I was affected by this - how can one not be? It's so haunting throughout, and has the unique structure of becoming more cryptic as it goes along, yet somehow finishing on a satisfying note. Liv Ullmann is famous for her amazing, silent performance, but Bibi Andersson impressed me just as much with her verbal haemorrhaging. The minimalism of this film - the sets were as basic as a theatre play, and the film embellishments (during the stunning opening sequence and the more experimental stylistic intrusions) were just incredible. Watching this on the projector in a dark room early on a Sunday morning added to the experience - I really don't think often enough about how the setting influences my perception of film/art experiences. I've watched a lot of films recently about the nature of performance, identity and acting - <i>Holy Motors</i>, <i>Alps</i>, <i>Silver Tongues</i>, <i>Symbiopsychtaxiplasm Take One</i> -- and this probably trumps them all, though it's also woven deep with the conflicts of career vs tradition/biology. And there's so many incredible moments here - the birth story, told almost word-for-word twice; the film burning and breaking; and Andersson's tale of infidelity on the beach, which with only words to illustrate it rivals <i>Week End</i> for the most erotic verbal scene in a film ever. It's no great surprise to finally watch the most acclaimed films ever and then realise they are brilliant, but I am questioning why I've never seen much Bergman. Maybe this is the beginning of a new phase.<br /><br />05 February 2013<br />Contraband<br />Baltasar Korm&#xE1;kur, USA / UK / France , 2012<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />What a waste of time. Kormákur is definitely into making different types of films, but he's no Robert Altman - this was a by-the-books thriller, built around a smuggling plot, that failed to distinguish itself from any other film with Mark Wahlberg and/or Ben Foster in it. Despite his use of murky, green-tinted sea photography (done to a much greater extent, obviously, in <i>The Deep</i>), this was bland, formulaic, and I actually fell asleep during the action sequences. Laurence really rated <i>Jar City</i> so I suppose I should watch that before closing the book on Kormákur for good.<br /><br />05 February 2013<br />Bunny and the Bull<br />Paul King, UK , 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on projector<br />This did not delight me. The idea of a film in the style of <i>The Mighty Boosh</i>, from the same director, is certainly an appealing one; what <i>Bunny and the Bull</i> made me realise is how much Barrett and Fielding really make <i>Boosh </i>work. Their smallish roles here were by far the strongest points of the film; their surrogates were lackluster, and the plot limp enough, that by the time the end rolled around I was completely uninterested. The childlike construction of the sets works when the humour is really nonsensical and bizarre, but this played it safe; there really wasn't any non-Barrett/Fielding<i> </i>part that I laughed at. I got bored with Edward Hogg's beta-male character pretty quickly, and it even seemed like the art direction stopped trying about halfway through. This is really a film for no one - not funny enough for adults, but too adult for children.<br /><br />06 February 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Point Blank<br />John Boorman, USA , 1967<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on projector<br />This film consisted of Lee Marvin, hellbent for revenge, grunting his way through a pretty simple plot that still managed to be confusing. Pre-<i>Zardoz</i> Boormann does some neat flashback tricks, resembling what you see in early Nic Roeg stuff - and some really odd moments of pacing, like he's trying to push the envelope. This has a great late 60's West Coast vibe, bouncing between San Francisco and LA, and the one shootout scene appears to be in the same place part of <i>Chinatown</i> was filmed, though maybe not. Either way, it's not quite noir, but a thriller either way and Marvin's wooden masculinity is pretty compelling for something like this. This revels in its mysteries and doesn't try to spell things out, and it became almost like an atmospheric riff than a thriller.<br /><br />06 February 2013<br />A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III<br />Roman Coppola, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on projector<br />This was so, so bad -- and yet offered so much potential. Roman Coppola wrote <i>Darjeeling</i> and <i>Moonrise </i>with Wes Anderson so I had high hopes, but this was a case of not being able to shake off Wes's influences -- or not being able to at least ape him half-decently. The presences of Jason Schwartzmann and Bill Murray weren't really a problem, as Schwartzmann was the only funny part of the film (though Murray clearly phoned it in); the big problem was casting Charlie Sheen in the lead role. The man-child character of Charles Swan was clearly supposed to fit Sheen since his public breakdown a few years ago, but actually the opposite happened - Swan is more benevolent, and more like an Apatow character than the true darkness that Sheen could convey. And as much as I like <i>Men At Work</i>, I don't think Sheen is a good enough actor to carry this film.  He seems uncommitted and is neither funny nor convincing. The character ends up only going halfway, yet these supposedly "smart" comedies require more. The Walter Mitty daydreams and other such colourful decorations were like dressing on a bland salad, and even these seemed badly derivative of Anderson -- too much irony, not enough sincerity, perhaps. The plot also failed to move me - a successful but horny guy has to get over a woman - and even this is resolved in the most obvious of ways, a sudden epiphany that just happens because of a bender.  (And not even an interesting bender).  The ending was just <i>8 1/2</i> crossed with the credits from an early Altman film, and as much as I was glad it was over, it felt rushed, like there was still a half-hour of film left that they were too lazy to make.I probably sound a bit harsh, but this really was without any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />13 February 2013<br />Your Sister's Sister<br />Lynn Shelton, USA , 2011<br />Location: M/S Victoria, cabin 5606<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br /><p class="p1">I'm starting to tire of Mark Duplass, but I want to see more by Lynn Shelton cause I loved <i>Humpday</i> so much. This takes a leap forward in terms of production values, and I watched a nice 1080p Blu-Ray rip. Yet the pastoral shots of the Puget Sound location didn't really integrate with the human drama unfolding; it felt obligatory, like a response to the whole 'mumblecore' definition forced upon her. Still, this was mostly great. The structure became immediately obvious and I knew how this would play out, but it was still fun to watch. The British character was perhaps a bit too simple in her backstory, but she's a good enough actress that it was palatable. It's only during the third act that things start to fall apart, as we have to deal with some wobbly screen representations of emotional stress and also watch Duplass destroy his bicycle in a way that is supposed to be significant. It all ties up a bit too nicely and the very last shot was also predictable, but I'm nitpicking; Shelton has again made an amazing, honest, and simple film. I think I actually miss the shitty audiovisuals of <i>Humpday</i> here; though we still got a shaky camera, the polish didn't really benefit the story. On to <i>My Effortless Brilliance</i> next.</p><br /><br />13 February 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Master<br />Paul Thomas Anderson, USA , 2012<br />Location: <br />Format: <br /><p class="p1">When my mom called up and non-recommended this, saying "It was... weird" I had a feeling I would like it. I'm glad now that Anderson made the dull, overrated <i>There Will Be Blood</i> because it allowed him surely the freedom to make this exactly the way he wanted to. This is a cryptic, brooding film that doesn't worry about connecting things together. Instead, we get a buddy movie, sort of; though one that is rooted in a cult, yet somehow manages to not be consumed by the topic. The performances manage to evoke something really striking, even when they are clearly based in bullshit beliefs; the 'processing' of Hoffman's Cause is clearly supposed to be Scientology, but it touches on something genuinely probing, which is maybe the point. Not that there is any truth behind this shit, but that you can find value in any form of system you choose to follow. But again, it's not really about the processing; it's about Phoenix and Hoffman's strong, unexplainable connection. Everything about this was, well, masterful. I'm very interested in mid-20th century mental health treatments (a la <i>Three Christs of Ypsilanti</i>) so I almost wanted more of the traditional treatments on Phoenix. That he actually seems to develop mature adult behaviours is maybe the dark twist of the film. Stunning; I think I'lll watch this again.</p><br /><br />18 February 2013<br />Fire Sale<br />Alan Arkin, USA , 1977<br />Location: M/S Victoria I ferry to Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br />Alan Arkin didn't direct many films but he directed my very favourite, so I thought this might be worth a shot. A comedy that tries so hard to be madcap and zany, it's rooted in juvenile slapstick and despite strong performances by Arkin, Sid Caesar and Vincent Gardenia this was pretty tough going. I watched a TV rip with the swear words overdubbed , which provided some of the biggest laughs for me. This probably could have been better if it wasn't so half-assed, but at least Arkin looks like Ira from Yo La Tengo and we get a small role by a beardless Richard Libertini. When you're stuck on a boat for 16 hours, intelligence isn't always necessary. A "forgotten yuk!" for sure.<br /><br />18 February 2013<br />Le Doulos<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France / Italy , 1962<br />Location: M/S Victoria I ferry to Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br /><p class="p1">As rewarding as I expected. Melville's film has a strange plot structure that (like <i>Le Samouraï)</i> uses ambiguity to create a complex format of knowledge and unknowing, leading to an inevitable conclusion after it seems to be all wrapped up. It's a strong performance from Belmondo, who can't shake his rapscallion nature as his appearances in Godard films have destined him to; even as a somewhat "heroic" figure here he's a bit sinewy. Michel Piccoli steals the film in the little bit of screen time he gets, but maybe that's just my extreme Piccoli fandom kicking in. The scenes of Belmondo using a rotary telephone are a high (yet random) point for enjoyment.</p><br /><br />19 February 2013<br />Love Streams<br />John Cassavetes, USA , 1984<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I felt like watching this and I'm glad I did. Lots of life parallels, which are there in any artwork if you are looking for them at a given moment, but this is really ripe for the picking.I think this is the most powerful Cassavetes film after <i>Husbands</i>, or maybe in a different way. I was going to write here how as great as Cassavetes and Rowlands are, the dog Jim steals the show. But then I thought about how great the 8 year old son is, and IMDB shows that he never acted again. What an insane tour de force - the most hallucinatory of his work, featuring actual dreams and hallucinations, and a script that allows for total insanity and yet such "real", brutal displays of emotion simultaneously. The final shots of Rowlands and Cassavetes looking at each other through rain-soaked windshields almost made me cry. And yet, like <i>The Master</i> (which I also just watched and keep thinking about), this structurally is so free and unconventional, like all of his work, but maybe even a bit moreso -- it seems like it should be unsatisfying by traditional metrics, but then since every performance is dialed up to the max, it's fulfilling - or exhausting, maybe, is a better way to put it. Probably 75% of films in the history of cinema try to deal with love but none seem as sophisticated (while also being as extreme) as this one. This was a good choice for tonight and a second viewing (after some years) really brings things out that I didn't remember - I almost feel like watching this again from the beginning right now.<br /><br />24 February 2013<br />The Five Obstructions<br />Jørgen Leth, Lars von Trier, Denmark / Switzerland / Belgium / France , 2003<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />This is a whole lot of 'wow' packed into a deceptively simple package. Part <i>Exercises in Style</i>, part <i>Vertical Features Remake</i>, and a good bit of<i> Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Take One</i> thrown in, this pokes and prods the two filmmakers and opens up more questions than it answers. But that's half the fun. I knew the original Leth film from the 60s and was delighted to see it remade 5 times without any version being remotely like the original. Leth is such an interesting figure - he seems to have the refined European middle-aged man down, but he's wildly open to von Trier's provocations, and by the end I'm not sure which parts of what we see is his genuine introspection and what's a von Trier manipulation. Amazing.<br /><br />28 February 2013<br />White Dog<br />Samuel Fuller, USA , 1982<br />Location: Sari's flat<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br />I was at Sari's by myself for the night with no Internet (thankfully, for once) so I just watched what was on my hard drive. For some reason I had downloaded <i>White Dog</i> which I'd always meant to watch. For some reason Criterion released this on DVD. For some reason this film was made. I can see where Fuller was trying to address American race issues, but what he really made was a film about animal conditioning. This was so weird - not that the style or even plot was that weird, but it's just weird that it was made. The idea is such a ridiculous way to try to address social issues, but I love how B- and horror films (which this was somewhere in between, yet with pretty good production values and a true legend directing) sometimes grasp for those things. The guy who plays the racist grandpa at the end is wonderfully creepy, and really, the dog was a pretty good 'actor'. This was a feat of animal training in terms of the production of the film if not so much in the fictional one. A great oddity.<br /><br />05 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Life Without Principle<br />Johnnie To, Hong Kong , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />I'm not sure what I felt about <i>Life Without Principle</i> - it was compelling, well-constructed, and with a few memorable scenes, and as a commentary on banking and the financial crisis, it ended up being a lot different than what I expected. It was constructed a lot like <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, which actually makes me want to watch <i>Pulp Fiction</i> again, and being completely unfamiliar with Hong Kong cinema I'm not sure how to assess the tone and acting performances. The character of Panther was such an exaggerated archetype, as was the police investigator, which seemed fine for something satirical; but then the investment bank clerk was portrayed with such repressed humility that it made me reconsider the other performances in the film, as the whole thing seemed so uneven. Whenever I detected commentary, such as when she pressured the dim-witted elderly woman into investing in the high-risk stocks, it seemed to reverse course. But maybe there was a subtlety here I was missing; it all just felt a bit plain, so perhaps I needed to look deeper.<br /><br />07 March 2013<br />The Long Goodbye<br />Robert Altman, \nUSA , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DVD on projector<br />It's been years since I've seen this but it was a good choice for today's afternoon film. <i>The Long Goodbye</i> is essentially a perfect film - it satisfies every desire of what I want a great 1970s American film to be, and has such a brilliant performance by Gould that it's icing on the cake. Zsigmond's cinematography is as dazzling as in <i>McCabe</i>, except here we get a hazy take on LA noir. Interesting that this came out right before <i>Chinatown</i> and while both are brilliant, they are done in almost diametrically opposing styles. A few really amazing Altman moments here, such as the sound mix of the police gathered on the beach after Sterling Hayden's suicide, and the camera lingering on humping dogs in Mexico. The Marlowe fish-out-of-water private eye in the swinging 70s is the central current of the film, rippling throughout but never overindulging. All the clichés of the genre are travelled through, often without commentary. There's a few shots built around reflections in glass that are quite beautiful, and more than just Zsigmond jerking off - they comment on distance and illusion, and reflect the deception of the characters in the script. The Mexico scenes recall the phantasmagoric tragedy of <i>Under the Volcano</i> (as does Hayden's alcoholism) and even the bad guys are deconstructed here, being a multiracial gang of incompetent, short goons. Throughout everything, Gould slinks along in his ill-fitting suit, the pure beta male as anti-hero, taking abuse after indignity after embarrassment before finally conceding to some perverted form of justice. It's a study in friendship, really.<br /><br />06 March 2013<br />Palindromes<br />Todd Solondz, USA , 2004<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />I'm probably the only person in the world who hasn't seen <i>Happiness</i>, and that's not for any real reason. The only Solondz I was familiar with was <i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i>, which I saw in the late 90s and enjoyed. This was another story about a teenage girl, this time dealing head-on with abortion in a way that somehow felt even-handed despite the characters all being exaggerated and ridiculous. Solondz was clearly mocking the Christian right and I enjoyed the creepy portrayals, but I got a bit bored. The main gimmick of this film, of having different child actresses portray the main character, was OK but didn't really add much. I used to get Solondz mixed up with Todd Haynes and the similar technique of this vs. <i>I'm Not There</i> certainly doesn't help me to keep them straight. Despite the novel moments, I found the most enjoyable parts of the film to be the same teenage awkwardness that <i>Dollhouse</i> had (at least as far as I remember) and the accused-of-molestation nihilist cousin's one scene to be, by far, the most awesome part of this. Still, despite feeling lukewarm overall, I think I'm going to see the rest of Solondz's work.<br /><br />15 March 2013<br />O Lucky Man!<br />Lindsay Anderson, \nUK / \nUSA , 1973<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I actually started this at Patrick and Tuuli's place, on the DVD that I bought years ago and never watched. I fell asleep before disc one was finished but left the DVD in his care and downloaded a far worse quality VHS rip to complete this, cause I don't like leaving things hanging. Lately, I've been re-watching a lot of films that I've already seen, and the second (or third) times through have proved to be generally satisfying, to put it mildly. I've loved this film since I originally saw it, and I'm pleased to report that the intervening years haven't diminished my enjoyment of it -- if anything, a decade+ of actual life experience has given me a deeper appreciation of Anderson's satirical riff on modern Britain, capitalism, and ambition. This is about the most supremely "watchable" 3 hour arthouse film, as the time flies by and the performances, not just by McDowell but the whole talented cast, are utterly beauteous. This should be the antidote to <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, as the actors-in-multiple-roles thing actually benefits the film instead of being show-offy, and the massive scope of this film is completely successful. I've listened to the Alan Price soundtrack so many times over the years that I knew all the words so I sang along to 'Look Over Your Shoulder' at top volume without embarrassment. <i>O Lucky Man! </i>is truly one of the greatest.<br /><br />13 March 2013<br />Le Mépris<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy , 1963<br />Location: Kino Sõprus<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Sõprus is running a Godardi retrospektiv which is quite predictable in terms of selection - all the big ones, and nothing later than <i>Week End</i> (but, at least it includes <i>Week End</i>). I skipped the first few but couldn't resist seeing <i>Le Mépris</i> on proper 35mm film, even though it was supposed to only with Estonian subtitles. Actually, it had unannounced English subtitles which was cool, though I was hoping I could get by without. The print was pretty bad, and often out of focus, which I'm not sure if because the print is old or because Sõprus is slightly incompetent when it comes to showing films. But it was still wonderful to see this, which is definitely one of the greatest films ever made, or at least has one of the greatest trailers ever, which can be seen on YouTube. Seeing it on the big screen was great, and the sort of 'bad' sound mix (again, probably due to the age of the print and the equipment being subpar) made Delarue's overbearing soundtrack even more uncompromising, thus amplifying the imagery. Everything seemed BIG tonight. My own ex-wife just visited and though everything was amicable, it was something on my mind while I watched this again. But I realised that the marriage breakup in <i>Le Mépris</i> is actually not something I really connect to - I'd rank the hysterics of Zulawski's <i>Possession </i>as more affecting - because Bardot's distance and the general mystery prevents this from being totally relatable. Instead we have a film about film, primarily, and a film about this particular film, because the meta- levels of this are off the charts. This was Godard's first stab at really commercial work, his <i>Pineapple Express</i> in a way, and it didn't go well, which is mirrored in his retelling of Moravia's novel. And while he still manages to use his razor-blade madness in some of the edits and sound mixes (most notably during the variety show scene) this is clearly his attempt to compromise with big-time producers (Carlo Ponti fought with him throughout the production, if I remember correctly, and it's not hard to see why). The mere modernism alone isn't why I love this - it's perhaps the way it's reconciled with grand, classic elements, not just in the romantic score but in the overt use of the Ulysses myth, juxtaposed against their sleek, modern Italian flat, albeit under construction. As hard as it is to take your eyes of Brigitte Bardot, Piccoli's face has a million tiny muscles that move ever-so-slightly to convey pain, confusion, and fear. It's his performance that is the heart and soul - the one thing to connect to against Bardot's pouting and Jack Palance's vulgarity. The trailer calls this "the new traditional film by JLG" and that's exactly how to express it; he never again made anything remotely like this, and unlike when most edgy artists attempt to create a more accessible product, this is artistically unassailable, and one of the true achievements of the artform. If it was any other filmmaker this would be a career achievement, but Godard did so much else that is brilliant (and diverse) that we can only rank this among his masterpieces, not as the ultimate.<br /><br />14 March 2013<br />Pierrot le fou<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy , 1965<br />Location: Kino Sõprus<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Another beautiful film that I couldn't pass up the chance to see in the cinema, and tonight I was rewarded again with unannounced English subtitles and a very very good quality print. Does any film burst with life as much as this one? Even when it threatens to get bogged down in its sinewy caper plot, <i>Pierrot</i> rewards with scenes like the absurd conversation on the pier right at the end (where the crazy guy is followed by a song he hears only in his head), or Marianne and Ferdinand skipping along the beach while children dance behind them. It's comedy juxtaposed with irreverent celebrations, and two incredibly beautiful people just being beautiful. The love is real here, despite the betrayal - it's a whirlwind of energy, occasional ramshackle musical numbers, and an in-between political philosophy. Godard is beginning to push against his middle-class life here, but he still retreats into easy spectacle instead of the dogmatism to follow. I can't complain - this is by far the best of the nouvelle vague films that I've seen (though I'm woefully undereducated on Truffaut) and makes me feel so good to be alive. When they did the 'Ma ligne de chance' song I actually had tears in my eyes, and I'm not one for musical numbers. I was gonna stick around for <i>Masculin/feminin</i> but I felt like after this I was exhausted.<br /><br />18 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Walker<br />Alex Cox, USA / Mexico / Spain , 1987<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />Holy fucking shit. I have no idea what possessed me to watch this - I had no real interest in it, or in Alex Cox, and I'm not wild about historical biopics (you couldn't pay me to watch <i>Lincoln</i>). And it serves me right to have these preconceived notions, because <i>Walker</i> was so completely batshit insane that I must admit I loved it. The same spirit of 'what can we get away with?' that pervades all my favourite 60s and 70s absurdist classics was present here, in a rather undiluted form, perhaps later than I've seen it in anything else. Irony is different now, and this with it's bizarre surrealism and deliberate anachronisms uses plenty of it to make its statement about Reagan's involvement in Nicaragua (and US imperialism in general) -- but this is an invigorating irony, rather than the tired, cynical pummeling that is so pervasive now. Wow, was this nuts. At first I didn't know where it was going - from the opening scenes it seems to play with the conventions of the Western and period piece, but then some of the dramatic exchanges in the opening 20 minutes are played straight - like it was unwilling to commit. As it goes along, it unravels more and more, to parallel the moral decline of Walker, which is not the most original device. But when other directors would probably overplay this in clichés, Cox seems to take a sadistic glee in how bizarre he makes it. There are points when I shouted "I love this movie!" even though i was bored through much of it. The "power corrupts" narrative is quite tired - you can just watch <i>Godfather Part II</i> instead, but then you don't get to see Rene Auberjonois fighting with a parrot. As a look at the American concept of protectionism and an investigation into the dangers of a surface-level-benevolent ideology, it's a bit more intricate. The closing credits batter the viewer with clips from the then-contemporary situation in Nicaragua, which was a bit obvious for my taste, but after the ending scenes maybe it brought things together thematically. The one thing I found the most disappointing was that we only got two short scenes with Peter Boyle.<br /><br />19 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould<br />Fran&#xE7;ois Girard, Portugal / Canada / Finland / Netherlands , 1993<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />This was done brilliantly - with a figure as complex and fascinating as Gould, a traditional narrative structure wouldn't work. By breaking it into these short pieces, it's able to give intriguing, often contradictory glimpses at the man's life, without descending into biopic drudgery. Of course, it's bitty - I loved the Norman McLaren animation, but found some of the interviews dull  - but that's going to be the nature of a film like this. Since one actor played Gould throughout, it manages to feel cohesive enough, but not overly so. The chapter of him in the studio while the recording engineers are having coffee might be as close to perfect as this film gets, as it cracks a wedge between the sublime and the everyday. His his ideas about technology and audience, expressed in this film in what I'm sure is a simplified presentation, are remarkably ahead of their time and very much in-line with my own thoughts, mostly. As it's about an artist who kept his personal life miles away from his work, <i>32 Short Films</i> somehow manages to be speculative without feeling invasive.<br /><br />26 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000<br />Alain Tanner, France / Switzerland , 1976<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />This was my first foray into Tanner, and possibly into Swiss film overall. I was way, way into this; it's one of the most complete film critiques I've ever seen of actual life under late capitalism and the ongoing compromises one must make. That it was made almost 40 years ago doesn't detract from it's impact, as the musings on labour, the value of work, and ethical decisions are the same questions I'm constantly asking myself. As a work of narrative film this is also extremely accomplished, marked by fantastic acting and a very tight, ensemble-based script that doesn't use the plot as just an excuse to hang philosophical conversations. The black and white fantasy sequences give a hint of that <i>If....</i> feeling, momentary escapes of desire which we all dream of. The journalist character, played in perfect Elliot Gould style by Jean-Luc Bideau, is riveting, but Jacques Denis' history teacher is even better. Every scene with him in the classroom was a thrill, and for a film with very little actual conflict or tension, <i>Jonah</i> is fully satisfying from a dramatic angle. This is actually an extremely optimistic film, while being maturely realistic about the limitations of freedom from exploitation. For such a political film, the politics don't weight it down, and there is nothing dogmatic; it's not necessarily subversive, but attempts to crack under the surface of issues that many other films of the time can only gloss over. The city/country dichotomy is also really heavy in this film, which is also a film about borders - borders between class, gender/sexuality, and literal borders in the case of the Marie character who has to live in one country and work in another. No answers, of course, but where can we ever get answers? I found myself afterwards wondering what has changed now in 2013 -- how this film might seem 'dated'. Arguably the big difference (in terms of the concerns of these characters) would be the rise of the so-called creative class, which supposedly offers a satisfaction from work that doesn't resort to escape or agrarianism. I myself am generally critical of this movement and fear that ultimately it's even more exploitative, just in falsely individualistic sheep's clothing. These characters are so haunted by history, particularly May '68, that it weighs them down in 1975; our generation probably could use a bit more history and ideology.<br /><br />28 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Attenberg<br />Athina Rachel Tsangari, Greece , 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />I think I enjoyed <i>Attenberg</i> though it's a subdued sort of enjoyment. Everything was muted, from the plot to the performances, which was echoed by the way that every visual surface was bland and washed out. This aesthetic attention ensured that what would have been another otherwise bleak, existential film had some consistent quality to it. And instead of becoming yet another meditation on sex and death, the real dilemma is of everyday existence. There was just enough surrealism to carry this through without become a brutal social realist piece; the relationship between the two girls is underplayed, though central. This is a film of total resignation, not commitment. With Giorgios Lanthimos as the only other contemporary Greek filmmaker I know (and he has a role in this), I may have a strange view of it, but this had a lot in common with <i>Kynodontas</i>, more than the language for sure. This was a few years ago already and things have really collapsed in terms of their society, which makes me curious to see what will emerge over the next few years. As one character says here, "this is a country that skipped the Industrial Revolution" and I never thought about it that way, but it might be a key in understanding this perspective.<br /><br />29 March 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    My Effortless Brilliance<br />Lynn Shelton, USA , 2008<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I continue to be impressed with Lynn Shelton. Here's another low key but complex study of masculine friendships, beautifully shot on prosumer DV and with a minimalist approach to structure, editing, sets and music, which allows the nuances of the performances to shine. The lead character is a convincing asshole without any screen time actually dedicated to his assholism; it's like she's written such an archetype, that guy that everybody knows (or is), so no time needs to be wasted on backstory. Unlike <i>Baghead</i> (which this of course reminds me of) there's no need for a big dramatic climax - this is a film of small steps. It's inoffensive but offers a lot if you're into this type of thing.<br /><br />30 March 2013<br />Wrong<br />Quentin Dupieux, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />OK, I flat-out loved this. I could probably pick it apart by questioning what it actually SAYS as an artistic work; what the human element is; what the actual meaning of any of it is. I'm primarily motivated, these days, by trying to find actual meaning and value in creations; at the same time, I spend a lot of time with comedy, particularly in film, and that's why I'm going to give this such a high rating. Since I watch every shitty Hollywood comedy film, if I'm putting this against any of those, then <i>Wrong</i> is the best comedy I've seen in years. If I'm trying to justify this as a valid artistic expression then maybe it doesn't quite suffice, but I'm going to just say that this was wonderful to watch from start to finish and I wish more films had this sense of complete nonsense. The beach scene is maybe where it goes off the rails, because that actually threatens the consistency of the whole thing -- but it's okay, because it was just a brief interlude and this managed to wrap everything up in a way that somehow felt consistent and satisfying. It's time to watch everything else by Dupieux now.<br /><br />05 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Time Indefinite<br />Ross McElwee, USA , 1993<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: DVD on computer monitor<br />A conversation about something-or-the-other led to us watching McElwee's masterpiece, which I hadn't seen since 2000 or 2001. It's no shock that this hit me harder at age 33 than at 20, and I found myself choking back tears during some of the more powerful parts, even though this isn't actually a tear-jerker at all. McElwee's meditations on death are often hilarious, yet funny, and thus their sometimes pop-psychology approach can be forgiven. The seeming resolution of it all is annoyingly Hallmark, yet this is how his life went, and the undeniable pull of biology must conquer all. This is the last truly personal film he's made, in that it was really just chronicling a period in his life, and takes some of the focus off him (at least compared to <i>Sherman's March) </i>in favour of something more about his family, friends and history. All of his subsequent films, while still being personal, have been organised around a distinct purpose, which I can understand is more challenging for him artistically, yet part of me misses these early works - the most calm, yet freewheeling type of film imaginable. It's also shocking to me that this takes place, I think, around 1990-91, yet my aesthetic sense placed everything far earlier - and my friend thought it was even the 1970s, so ancient were the Southern accoutrements of house, fashion and town. Having still a memory of American life in 1990, this also emphasised the "realness" to me, and the interactions with his friends and family feel so insanely accurate to my own life, that I almost feel like the McElwee's are my phantom family. Of course this is 'real', or at least as verité as anything can be when you're talking to a guy sticking a 16mm camera in your face. McElwee continuously probes his own obsession with self-documentation (which would probably make him a good candidate for PBT itself) yet tastefully turns the camera off when his son is born. Despite the low-budget construction, there are a few parts that are spectacularly accomplished from an artistic angle, such as the reflection of the house on Charleen's glasses while she reminisces about it. Somehow, despite openly embracing all of the worst tendencies of personal essay films, McElwee has managed to transcend them all, and create (in my opinion) the finest example of the genre that I've ever seen. I immediately burned copies of this to send to a friend and my cousin, and I'm ready to be evangelical about the brilliance of this work.<br /><br />10 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Somebody Up There Likes Me<br />Bob Byington, USA , 2012<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This deliberately odd and extremely absurd comedy kept me laughing throughout, though it didn't certainly didn't amount to a masterpiece. Nick Offerman does his thing, in a slightly different character than Ron Swanson but with such similar delivery that it's familiar territory. The nonsensical story had enough dry, brutal stomach punch jokes that I found just enough sublimity to recommend this and maybe even watch it again. A few recurring gags (but not too many) made this feel probably more crafted than it actually was, but I definitely like comedies like this, which due to their relaxed nature, hit harder than the overdone Apatow/Stiller mainstream style.<br /><br />11 April 2013<br />Parents<br />Bob Balaban, Canada / USA , 1989<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />Balaban's oddity is nothing like I expected from it's beginning scenes - the Comic Sans typeface and bright 1950's scenery set me up for something light and absurd. This was beautifully made, but as it hurtled towards increasing macabre terrain, I became less engaged. The sets were constructed with an attention to detail as great as on <i>Mad Men</i>, and the scene where the boy hides in the kitchen closet made a wonderful examination of 1950's household pantry goods. At times I felt that Balaban was trying to make a complex triangle about sexuality, consumerism and conformity, but it's not really fleshed out. The brief comment on Vietnam/defoliation seemed forced, but was probably nothing more than character establishment. All of these suggestions add up to something grandly entertaining, especially due to the child actor's wonderful blend of fear and naiveté. You could argue this as a pro-vegetarian film but maybe I look too hard for that; or maybe this was just <i>Eating Raoul</i> for kids. I've never seen Randy Quaid so good, and Bob Balaban can count this as another feather in his extraordinary cinematic cap.<br /><br />11 April 2013<br />Funny Ha Ha<br />Andrew Bujalski, \nUSA , 2002<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This wasn't funny in a ha-ha way or in any other way, being a film where essentially nothing happens and it's shot on such poor quality video that it feels like you're watching something much older, though it's from the past decade. The lead actress is stunning, and like most mumblecore films (sorry to keep using that term, but this is as definitive of one as there is), it allows the performances to be first and foremost, even at the expense of being compelling. Though the "plot" is boring, the character wasn't unlikeable, though nor was she really likeable; the high-school level romantic intrigue failed to captivate me, and seemed to even bore the filmmakers by the end. Maybe this is pure 'art cinema' because I felt the same way, after seeing this, that I usually feel after going to an art exhibition: null. I felt nothing watching this, and I supposed I didn't mind it, but I'm hardly compelled to seek out the rest of Bujalski's work. But I suspect that if I do, I'll find some subtle pleasures lurking within.<br /><br />12 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Cries &#x26; Whispers<br />Ingmar Bergman, Sweden , 1972<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This was a chore to get through and was the first Bergman film I've seen that I really didn't enjoy in the slightest. I could stare at Liv Ullmann all day, or so I thought, but the tedious nature of this script (which felt like a stage play, so claustrophobic and contained) made me watch it in several chunks because I kept falling asleep. The deep red dissolves are probably the most memorable thing about this, though maybe if I was more aware of the nuances of class strata in fin-de-siecle Sweden, I would have picked up on another level. What I thought about the most was the history of makeup - did eyeliner exist back then (whenever this was set) or was this an anachronism on Bergman's part? Insert some sort of joke about Bergman's obsessive clock imagery (which was on display throughout <i>Cries and Whispers</i>) and the root "chronos" of "anachronism" here.<br /><br />13 April 2013<br />3-Iron<br />Ki-duk Kim, South Korea, Japan , 2004<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Ki-Duk KIm's film was haunting and beautiful, but I'm not sure if I left it feeling significantly affected. In many ways it's a film about becoming invisible and reminded me of an idea I had when I was much younger, about crawling into people's houses and secretly occupying space in the same room as them. If it weren't for the caption over the last shot, I probably would have liked this a lot more. I mean, I did like it, but spelling it out with a lame quote really undercut things. There's a moment about halfway through where they find a dead man with his dog waiting by his side, and there's an expression on the dog's face that was a perfect cinematic moment. The wordless leads are good actors, and this is certainly fantastic in how it balances mood, pace and atmosphere.<br /><br />14 April 2013<br />Direkt&#248;ren for det hele<br />Lars von Trier, \nDenmark / \nSweden / \nIceland / \nItaly / \nFrance / \nNorway / \nFinland / \nGermany , 2006<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Von Trier's comedy is very concerned with its own genre, as evidenced by the director's own goofy voiceover intrusions. This was funny - very funny in parts, though trying too hard in others - thanks to a fairly simple screwball-style plot and a very strong performance by the lead actor. No surprises here, except maybe the resolution, but I wonder why I would have ever watched this if it wasn't by Von Trier (who I'm not even a big fan of). This was stylistically lovely, with all muted cool blues and gray and just enough absurdity (such as no explanation for what this company actually did for their business). It felt very American to me, in the construct of the stupidities and sometimes too-obvious beats. But it was certainly easy to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />15 April 2013<br />Death Race 2000<br />Paul Bartel, USA , 1975<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />It's strange I've never seen this before. It was different than I expected - exactly in the style of <i>Mr. Freedom</i>, so more funny than scary, and loosely constructed around a questioning of morality and violence. It's simliar to the satirical investigation of sexual prudence Bartel employed in <i>Eating Raoul</i>; not an airtight argument, and very problematic when you break it all down. I think It might be worth seeing the rest of Bartel's work. Because this was properly paced I enjoyed it throughout, even with the muddled denouement and lengthy racing scenes. The car stuff was actually done pretty well for what I'm sure what a low-budget production. This bears an obvious similarity to <i>La decima vittima</i>, which was maybe an influence, though with the wonderful 60's Italian design swapped out for a midwestern American decor (especially noticeable in the dinner they have in Albequerque). I should watch the Statham remake to see if it's remotely true to the speed-obsessed American trash culture ethos of this.<br /><br />16 April 2013<br />Journeys from Berlin/1971<br />Yvonne Rainer, USA / UK / West Germany , 1980<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I hold this film in great esteem, considering it to be an unrecognised masterpiece, and in the genre of experimental/essay film too, so it really ticks my buttons. Revisiting it after a few years, I was struck by how formally experimental it is, and actually quite difficult to pay attention to, at points. I had forgotten that well over half of the film consists of a 50 year old woman rambling in a pseudo-therapy session, occasionally riffing on themes that intersect with the other narration about violence and ideology, but often just being confusing. The younger female narrator, reading a diary from I think the 1950's, sometimes reminded me of the speaker in "Blue" Gene Tyranny's 'Out of the Blue', which is an odd comparison, but it made this feel very familiar since I listen to that track a lot. Rainer is a really interesting artist and I don't see any relation between this and the art of dance/choreography, which she comes out of, but I don't know why there has to be. I found myself less engaged with the ideas here and often tranced out, especially during the long horizontal pans over domestic objects. But that's precisely what emerged from this viewing - the domesticity and personal nature of this work. While this is definitely an investigation of political violence and psychoanalysis (and the links between them, however tenuous), Rainer herself is the glue that holds this together, even if she's removed herself from an obvious point-of-view. This might be one example of a film that I saw for a second time and actually understood even less than the first time, if that makes any sense. I was preoccupied with the discussion of Ulrike Meinhof and her actions the first time, but here I was seeing it more from a feminist viewpoint, especially as Vito Acconci played interlocutor and I was taking the whole film as more about the self than the society. I didn't take many notes this time, unlike five years ago where I filled a few notebook pages, except to write down one quote: 'You have to know what your personal struggle is, and then get to the other side of it. Pouring unexamined personal rage, or whatever, into social action is going to foul things up somewhere along the line.'<br /><br />21 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Our Lady of the Turks<br />Carmelo Bene, Italy , 1968<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I'd always meant to check out Bene, as Amos Vogel raves about him, but I never understood why he wasn't talked about more, or celebrated by more film critics. And now I understand - cause he isn't that great. I'm basing this on one film, which I think was his first, but I was not into this at all. Bene actually has a very painterly quality to his images, as this, which was a series of vignettes loosely tied together by Bene's own lead performance, with some visual imagery that was impressive. There's a baroque use of color, and a few sections in general stood out - the shimmery haze of the opening sequence, one black and white section in the middle, and a rotating sexual scene surrounded by floral effects which was undercut by a very disjoined soundtrack. But nothing added up for me, and I say this as someone with a long history of loving rambling, nonsensical films.  I could have probably watched this without subtitles as I barely paid attention to any of the language -- any theme or plot was lost to me beyond the titular character appearing here and there, and Bene's constant presence. I can see why Vogel found this subversive - there is a rejection of just about every tradition imaginable, both thematic and structural. But apart from being a curiosity of its time, I did not enjoy this one bit. I'l stick to them ore strident surrealism of Arrabal or even Jodorowsky (who I am not a fan of, but would prefer <i>Fando y lis</i> to this any day).<br /><br />21 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Sightseers<br />Ben Wheatley, UK , 2012<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />It's an odd one, <i>Sightseers</i> -- billed as a comedy, it wasn't particularly funny; taken as a thriller, it's not exactly thrilling. The film was unwilling to commit to a strong viewpoint and it would be cutesy when it needed bite, and vice-versa. But there was 'something' about <i>Sightseers</i> that I liked, some indefinable quality that made this compelling. There's some gestures towards defining a modern British identity, but it's not fully developed, which was disappointing. Yet the film probably says more about loneliness than anything else, perhaps by accident. The two leads are great, subdued actors that manage to be convincingly 'real' despite their ever-increasing psychosis. That this is the same guy who made <i>Kill List</i> surprises me - I wasn't aware of that until I finished watching it, but I didn't see any similarities.<br /><br />22 April 2013<br />Brick<br />Rian Johnson, \nUSA , 2005<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />I felt like watching this again, so I laid in bed and had a deluxe iPad presentation. I understand why some of my friends hate this film; it's certainly not for everyone, and the second time through I found it more cutesy than edgy. It's easy to see why Gordon-Levitt became a star and nobody else in this film did (save the excellent Lukas Haas); he manages to make the corny, wooden dialogue rip off the screen, which makes the other teenage extras look especially talentless. I'm not sure if that was intentional on Johnson's part, or just inexperience on both the directing and acting side. That said, this is still my favourite of his three films by far; the better acting presence of Brody and Ruffalo in <i>Brother Bloom</i> helps that, but the whimsicalities are too much, whereas <i>Looper</i> could have benefited from more whimsicality. Still love how 'Sister Ray' is the closing credits theme, and the odd humorous intrusions (the Pin's mother serving Gordon-Levitt breakfast, for example) are great in situating this well within the gimmick without wearing it out. I don't think I'll ever watch this again, but it did perk me up this morning.<br /><br />22 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Antonio Gaud&#xED;<br />Hiroshi Teshigahara, Japan , 1985<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Through it's simplicity, <i>Antonio Gaudi</i> is a radical polemic for what a documentary film could and should be. This is a film that has no verbal language until the last 15 minutes, except for one sudden intrusion about a half-hour in -- and to be honest, it could have done without these as well. For most of it's duration, Teshigahara's camera explores the work of Gaudi, bringing together a fusion of film, sound, and architecture in perfect balance. This is a technical manual for how a camera can illustrate a subject, as we see all manner of pans, tilts, and tracking shot to explore the nooks and crannies of Gaudi's genius; the movement of the camera is usually as fluid and non-linear as the architect's natural forms, which is an advantage that the film medium would have over still photography or a book. But then, this film isn't trying to replace a book - if I want to learn about Gaudi the man, or Gaudi's life, I would go elsewhere. This is a supplement, or rather a crucial piece in understanding an artist's work, and it doesn't try to be a succinct biopic or even a biography at all. The work itself stands through this, but in addition, we get a wonderful portrait of urban life. The interiors of Gaudi's houses and buildings often look menacing, as they are usually shown without any sign of life outside of the stationary architectural elements (which are as lively as any architect has ever created, but still, no people). At times I was unsure about these shots, as they don't always indicate an inviting, organic experience to actually inhabit. But when we see Gaudi's exteriors and parks, public space explodes, as we see children and adults occupying his various details. This is a holistic portrait and where his great genius seems to really emerge, as well as drawing attention to the manipulative power of documentary cinema. And the music as well, composed mostly by Takemitsu, blends Western cadences with eerie, underlying electronics. Some passages sound like MEV, with bubbling, unfolding synthesizers and other ambient features, which are perfectly suited to illustrate Gaudi's otherworldly forms. I mean, this man's architecture is like Sun Ra's music put into physical forms, in places. But because Takemitsu doesn't shy aware from more traditional elements, it suggests a futurism that is based on the past, which is echoed in the on-screen quotation by Gaudi in the film's final shot. By the time we get to the Sagrada Familia, it's like a huge, uplifting plateau that the film has been building towards. And yes, I'm disappointed in the voiceover used here but it's not too intrusive, and we get long lingering looks at the subtle details of this insane creation.<br /><br />23 April 2013<br />Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles<br />Chantal Akerman, Belgium / France , 1975<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />After finishing the 193 minutes of <i>Jeanne Dielman</i>, I see that according to IMDB this should have been 201 minutes. Maybe this is an NTSC/PAL difference, but I feel ripped off that I got 8 minutes less than I expected. The thing is, in the 193 minutes I watched, nothing happens, at least not until the very end, and maybe that's the entire point - the duration is there to emphasise the payoff. But, spoilers, I could have just watched <i>Dillinger e mort</i> again which is shorter and a lot more fun. I'm not saying I wasn't impressed with <i>Jeanne Dielman</i> - it's maybe one of the quietest angry films I've ever seen, and like a low-key European alternative to <i>A Woman Under the Influence</i>, which was made at the same time. Delphine Seyrig is always a pleasure to watch, and I'm actually really into durational challenges, in theory. This took me the whole goddam day to get through and it was pretty much what I expected, and I'd never sit through it again, but I'm glad I put the time into it this once.<br /><br />23 April 2013<br />Rubber<br />Quentin Dupieux, France , 2010<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br /><i>Rubber</i> was a bit too caught up in its own conceit to really deliver. The opening passage, where the police offer gives a goofy speech about films happening for 'no reason', sets the tone, and while I like Dupieux's weird humorous absurdism, I think he suffers from being too sloppy about it. Both this and <i>Wrong</i> set out a very strange world that should follow some rules, even if it's illogical, yet by the end both fall apart in favour of easy outs. <i>Wrong</i> was a million times better than this, mostly because it had more Jack Plotnick and much funnier. <i>Rubber</i> wasn't a waste of time, as I enjoyed sitting through it, it was short enough, and Wings Hauser was fun. Actually, maybe it was a waste of time, as there doesn't seem to be much that Dupieux has to actually say, but that's ok for entertainment. For whatever his weaknesses are, Dupieux isn't passing this off as a grand artistic statement. But visually, both of these films were so beautifully shot that it sets them as a cut above the usual comedic fare. I'll be curious to see <i>Wrong Cops</i> as it continues his police officer theme, and seems to be some sort of sequel to <i>Wrong</i>, and it has Eric Wareheim. But the next exciting genius of surrealist cinema he is not.<br /><br />24 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Hail<br />Fred Levinson, USA , 1973<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This forgotten 70s misfire was prefaced by titles explaining that because of Watergate, this film was shelved, and that Nixon himself sent spies to observe the production of it. I don't believe that for a second, as this has essentially nothing to do with Watergate, nor can it be taken even slightly seriously. As a compendium of late 60's tropes it's a curiosity, coming a few years too late and so terribly assembled that it's got good trainwreck value. But as a fan of these types of things, you can really find better versions of every element of <i>Hail </i>elsewhere. The dissidents-in-lockdown are better dealt with in <i>Punishment Park</i>; the goofy president/cabinet interactions in <i>Babo 73</i>; the genuine looming people's revolution in lots of things, like <i>The Spook Who Sat By the Door</i>. Still, there's a great pop song in the middle asking what happened to the hippie movement; one genuinely funny scene at the end involving a gumball machine; and a mercifully short running time. "Obscure for a reason", sure, but that's that magnificent seventies for ya.<br /><br />24 April 2013<br />Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives<br />Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands , 2010<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Writing about this one is going to be difficult. I don't have any context for the supernatural mysteries of <i>Uncle Boonmee</i>. This lush, dynamic, grey-blue world was inviting and spellbinding, but for all I know these could be standard Thai children's TV stories. I'm not saying the context should matter to how the film affected me, but it made me curious as to how this imagery comes across in his native culture. To me, this wasn't like anything I've ever experienced before - a world where ghosts show up for dinner and everyone is nonplussed, and a catfish fucks a princess. But then whenever it feels like it's about to be grasped, Weerasethakul pulls away and shifts to some other thread. And these surreal aspects, which aren't really surrealism, aren't magical realism, aren't anything -- were not the driving impulse of the overall film.This could just be the Thai version of <i>Cocoon</i> for all I understood of it, but I felt this was a rich film about spirit and presence, that took the leap from 'fascinating' to outright 'amazing' when we visit an empty karaoke bar for the final scene. I wasn't confused; maybe I just sat back and let things take over. Though there's a head-scratching scene in the hotel coming at a point where I didn't think I could scratch my head anymore - surprises nonstop. This is maybe one of the most original contemporary film languages I've yet encountered; or, again, maybe this is just like a <i>Twilight</i> film with the exotic Thai setting to give it a novel flavour to my inexperienced eyes. I don't know if I'll figure it out, and I don't think it matters.<br /><br />26 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Riddles of the Sphinx<br />Laura Mulvey, Peter Wollen, UK , 1979<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br /><i>Riddles of the Sphinx</i> is one of the most thought-provoking films I've ever seen, yet I feel strangely uncompelled to say much about it. When a film theorist makes a film you know you're in for a heavy time, but because I have such a deep interest in feminist cinema I held on for the ride and I'm ultimately glad I put in the time. The tight structure, of numbered sections, is offset by some genuinely bewildering choices. The 360 degree rotations, seemingly consistent, break down during the passage where they are driving, which seems shockingly sloppy; but then, as that central 'narrative' of the film starts to break down as well, becoming a mountain of dreams and indistinct associations, I felt some sort of symmetry between format and content. I recognize the intent of this film from the viewpoint of a female film theorist - that is it a film entirely about film itself, about the act of viewing, and the means of cinematic representation on a much more abstract level than anything I've ever experienced before. But by going halfway - juxtaposing a story, even if only for part of the film, and a fragmentary one at that, on this otherwise experimental image-essay - seems to reinforce the traditional means of film interpretation. I was starting to feel that the polemic about day care and trade unions was victimising the woman, but right when I started to feel disappointed, the aforementioned turn towards illusion occurred. This is truly a fascinating work to ponder, perhaps more fun to think about than to actually watch, but I'm feeling just a bit behind the curve. Sound was not an afterthought either - the dominant, Terry Riley-like organ strands seemed to sharpen my attention, while keeping with the soft, rounded non-linearity of the camerawork. And the messy, layered speech, often incomprehensible, was greatly enjoyable, but I always like that effect.  The final sequence, of the mercury drops in the labyrinth, seemed to beg a rudimentary interpretation - is it a vaginal stand-in? Sadly, after the 90 minute onslaught that is <i>Riddles of the Sphinx, </i>I realised that was the best I could do. You've outsmarted me, <i>Riddles of the Sphinx</i>, but you did so in a brilliant way.<br /><br />27 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming<br />Robert Aldrich, USA / West Germany , 1977<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Robert Aldrich's thriller is a bit far-fetched (the way that Lancaster was able to take over the missile silo was shockingly easy) and it seemed unsure of whether it wanted to be an action/thriller, political essay or psychological drama. But it kicked ass anyway, with great performances by Lancaster, Joseph Cotten, and Richard Widmark - and Charles Durning's hacky presidential schtick was perfect for the tone and milieu of this. Given the post-Watergate climate this was fairly good fun that managed to seemingly comment on a general lack of faith in government at the time, though to be honest, I was just onboard for the ride. The political commentary on this - that Vietnam was a giant deliberate lie - is pretty thin, though not untrue; still I wonder if it might had been more compelling if they had just left the National Security Council memo unstated in the film, thus creating some mystery. This ended pretty much the only way it could, which wasn't to say I loved that decision, but couldn't really suggest an alternative.<br /><br />28 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Le Deuxieme Souffle<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France , 1966<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This was among the more mellow Melville films I've seen, or maybe it just felt that way due to the length, and that there's over an hour of buildup before the crime really happens. This is like all the other Melvilles I've seen - we simultaneously see cops and baddies working against each other, with our sympathies vacillating between both sides. Lino Ventura, who was the lead, at times resembled an older DeNiro facially. As an anti-hero he was compelling, and motivated by a code of ethics despite his slimy, murderous nature, but since the film spent so much time setting up all of the plot elements it took awhile to even realise he was the main focus (despite his name being said a zillion times in the dialogue). Overall i enjoyed watching this, but I think the black and white Melvilles really can't compare to the visual richness of his colour films.<br /><br />01 May 2013<br />David Holzman&#x27;s Diary<br />Jim McBride, USA , 1967<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Another film in the 'films about film' film genre, <i>David Holzman's Diary</i> employs a lot of the same concepts in other films about camera and voyeurism, by stylistically situated in a late 60's 'underground cinema'/New York milieu. I really enjoyed this, which falls victim to some clichés of the faux-documentary style, but is well-written in a way that feels mostly natural. As Holzman descends into his own camera-driven psychosis, the film starts to allow itself to breathe and to let the low-key, black and white photography speak for itself. The last 'act' is particularly distinct in its framing and is almost believable at points. i think <i>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm </i>was perhaps a bit more challenging in a similar territory, but this is also a hidden gem.<br /><br />01 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Army of Shadows<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France / Italy , 1969<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I didn't intend to watch this because it's May Day, and the French resistance isn't exactly the same thing as the international workers of the world, but a sense of camaraderie and anti-Fascism pervaded ever second of <i>L'armée des ombres</i> so it was slightly appropriate. This was a real change from the usual Melville fare, which is not to say that any of his films are ordinary, but being set in World War II made it a different vibe than his cops and baddies stories usually are. This was tragic; absolutely beautiful; and gripping as well. It's quite an adventure film, yet incredible in how low-key it is. There's a submarine, parachuting, hiding from Nazis, and torture, yet all of the violence is kept off-camera, which might be even more powerful, when a few (or many) scars show. Lino Ventura is again fantastic and it's interesting how France under the Nazis doesn't seem like a war-torn country here - people still seem to be going about their middle-class lives as before, and Ventura's character is impeccably dressed through most of the film.<br /><br />03 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Take Shelter<br />Jeff Nichols, USA , 2011<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I supposed <i>Michael Shannon Yells At Cloud</i> wouldn't have been as good of a title. About halfway through <i>Take Shelter</i> I started to think again of <i>Safe</i>, and how this was like a version of that film, except with the feminist critique of domestic imprisonment replaced by a blue-collar salt-of-the-earth workingclassploitation element. And as <i>Safe</i>'s female viewpoint was the best thing about it, <i>Take Shelter</i> definitely felt like it was lacking something. But by the end, I felt that this was a good, possibly great film, and it's only misstep was emphasising this red state 'heartland' culture a bit too much. This is a film that is really an attack on the current American economic climate, but still, the constant window into these financial problems reduced the characters to clichés. And clichés don't help when a film is focused around something so personal that it may not even exist. Shannon is so fascinating to watch that he carried the film, and when his blowup finally comes about 90 minutes in, it's almost a "thank god we got that out of the way!" sense of relief. The digital video was clean and the effects were just tasteful enough to give this enough contemporary Gothic feel, like David Gordon Green's films before he stopped caring, and the whole atmosphere was soaked in that fire-and-brimstone Americana juice. It's like being trapped inside the first few Palace Brothers albums, and that's not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />05 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Alice ou la derni&#xE8;re fugue<br />Claude Chabrol, France , 1977<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Chabrol's film is supposed have something to do with <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>but it's only really loosely based on it. This is a dreamy, confusing fantasy which is what I was in the mood for, though the final summation was just a bit simplistic. This really takes its time - the first 30 minutes have essentially nothing happening - and I think the way the film starts, with the husband mid-conversation, is probably what I found most formally striking. I've seen a lot of surreal films and they all have their different styles - Chabrol's was very melancholy, and not at all concerned with visual stimulus, instead relying on mood through pacing, music, and facial expressions. This was quite an intimate film for something so inherently impossible, and I'm trying not to read anything into this regarding her marriage, such as this being some sort of judgement/commentary on her choice for self-assertion.<br /><br />06 April 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Room 237<br />Rodney Ascher, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br /><i>Room 237</i> was available as a lovely blue-ray rip to download, and Ville really wanted to see it, and so did Agnieszka, and I was happy to sit through this a second time, especially in the full glory of the Ptarmigan projection, which honestly was almost as good as the small cinema I saw this in the first time. The second time through was every bit as enjoyable, with the added bonus that I could let myself really fixate on the details of the images more myself, without having to focus as much on the narration. I stand by everything I said about this - it's an amazing film that really opens amazing questions about how we take in all art and culture. I definitely, definitely believe that the theories about Native Americans and the Holocaust are "true", though <i>Room 237</i> really questions what "true" even means beyond "Was the intent of Kubrick". But in that case, yes, I think this was Kubrick's intent (partially), though I'm not so concerned with what Kubrick intended; if someone thinks he made <i>The Shining</i> to confess that he faked the moon landing, and there's no such 'truth' to that, then I don't think it diminishes that person's interpretation of it. That said, Ryan's obsession with watching it backwards and forwards at the same time is nuts, but I totally love that he sees it that way and will defend his viewpoint, or rather his right to that interpretation, as furiously as I'd defend any of my own interpretations.<br /><br />06 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    John Dies at the End<br />Don Coscarelli, USA , 2012<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I think the times have come around to Don Coscarelli's sensibility - the horror/comedy thing has erupted in mainstream cinemas the past few years, meaning he should cash in. <i>John Dies at the End </i>is a definitely accessible film, and I actually enjoyed it a lot (whereas the other film I saw by him, <i>Bubba Ho-tep</i>, I really disliked, and I know I've never seen <i>Phantasm </i>but I've also never wanted to). This is well-constructed, funny but still exciting, and a good easy watch on a morning when I didn't feel like thinking much. It avoided easy misogyny or racial humour too, which feels commendable at this point, and the monsters were all creepy-crawly types so the violence had a unique tone. The drug subplot made it feel like a Philip K Dick story, and the leads were good too. Yep, all around thumbs-up here.<br /><br />07 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Upstream Color<br />Shane Carruth, USA , 2013<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />I'm in awe right now, having just watched this, and I wasn't going to write anything more here than one line, such as "holy fucking shit" or "this far exceeded my expectations, which were very high" but maybe I should try to get down what I'm feeling. Holy fucking shit. This far exceeded my expectations, which were very high. <i>Primer</i> is a film I love; so much more than a sci-fi/time-travel film, described best in a great review I read: it's really about the loss of trust, and the time-travel stuff just follows from that. But over the years, it's grown in my estimation to be not just a great film but one that really is unlike anything I've ever seen - the vibe, the feel, the way it's constructed, is such a distinct vision, yet it's singularity is easy to overlook when distracted by the complicated plot and amazing nature of it's low-budget (and subsequent success). But Shane Carruth essentially disappeared for 9 years and then surfaced with this, which he also made exactly the way he wanted to, without any studio interference. I have the tendency to hype things up in my mind, and when I heard about this I deliberately avoided reading anything about it; I decided to actually purchase it from iTunes since it supports Carruth, which is the first time I've ever actually bought a film that way. But then iTunes wouldn't let me watch it on the projector, so I ended up downloading a torrent anyway, which I guess is ethically OK since I did pay for it, but seriously, fuck iTunes. Anyway I've already typed all of this without actually saying anything about <i>Upstream Color</i>, but I'm not sure what I can actually say after only one viewing. So let me pile on the superlatives: this was way, way, better than <i>Primer</i>. The main impact that I felt here was an emotional one, which is not to say <i>Primer</i> was unemotional, but it's a subdued sort that is hard to connect to. Whereas <i>Upstream</i>, a film that is even less graspable than it's predecessor, is bathed in warm, romantic passion, even if it's a damaged, fragmentary one. When Brett left the room I cried a little but, but I'm not sure if I was crying because of the narrative or because I just felt such a power from the imagery, the construction, the sound, and my own amazement that someone could make art like this. The lead actress in this was so good that I expect she'll become a star - she certainly deserves to - and Carruth's own performance is stunning as well. I've been looking for a film (or any other form of art) that can capture the imagination and magic of Ben Marcus's writing, particularly <i>Notable American Women</i>, and this might be it. I should watch this many, many more times but like the time I took psilocybin mushrooms, maybe I'm happy with the singular experience. I'm going to stop typing now.<br /><br />08 May 2013<br />Suna no onna<br />Hiroshi Teshigahara, \nJapan , 1964<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Because this is written by Kobu Abe, I thought it would be extremely surreal and fucked up, but it was more of a thriller/horror film than I expected. Teshigahara put together a masterpiece of mood and drama, with the sand and water used to maximum visual dramatic effect. The acting was a bit forced at times, but I don't really understand the nuances of Japanese expressions so that's probably not a fair criticism. This was haunting, though less about longing and companionship than about freedom and dependency (though I suppose those themes are inter-related). As long as this was, it felt necessary to set the pace and the proper claustrophobia that the setting dictated.<br /><br />08 May 2013<br />Away We Go<br />Sam Mendes, USA / UK , 2009<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />An utterly horrible film. If I realised this was a Sam Mendes film I probably wouldn't have watched it (as I would still probably consider <i>American Beauty</i> my least favourite film of all time). I'm so not interested in the things that my fellow thirty-somethings are interested in - having children, starting families, etc. This was made extra worse by the clumsy attempts to add Apatow-styled risque jokes throughout, none of which were funny. Jim Gaffigan's small role, and the use of the VU's 'Oh Sweet Nothin' were the only points of this that were tolerable. Krasinski is like a shitty version of Mark Duplass, and hidden behind a beard, he lost his ability to convey empathy with his cute smiles, which was the only thing he had going for him. I fail to understand the popularity of Maya Rudolph, who is not funny, nor particularly likeable as a 'straight' character. I don't know when I will learn to stop bothering with shit like this; at least a Jason Statham film is decidedly lowbrow instead of grasping for an <i>NPR/Fresh Air</i>-type middlebrow respectability.<br /><br />11 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Grin Without a Cat<br />Chris Marker, France , 1977<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I watched the 1993 edit of this, which is only three hours instead of four, and I'm glad for the reprieve, though this was a brilliant work that I mostly enjoyed throughout. This was both like and unlike <i>Sans Soleil</i>; similar in the way it took a non-fiction structure while being evasive, impressionistic and non-committal, but dissimilar in the form of the images itself. And memory is the true subject here, just as in all of Marker's work that I've seen. Marker's achievement in finding this material is astounding, especially knowing there's an extra hour I didn't see and this was the pre-digital era. A lot of this is didactic and dull, as the nature of the topic would indicate. Yet, this is proto-Adam Curtis, stylistically, with surreal interludes and popular culture bits chucked in (though in a more restrained manner) and Marker's own viewpoint pulled back somewhat, allowing the images to tell the story. The story, though, is what didn't happen; this is a eulogy for socialism, yet if it puts forth any argument at all, it's that "real" socialism was never attempted. Everyone lost sight of the prize, so preoccupied with the machinations of personality and power, though this is not a moralistic shaming or illustration of corruption. There are no villains in this film, and the grand consequences of the 20th century are not the focus. An ideology is victimised, and at times I feel like Marker isn't mourning it so much as trying to understand how it happened. While I was being swept up in Che Guevara, Castro adjusting his microphones, the endless squabbling of 1967-68 French activists, and even Watergate, <i>Le fond de l'air est rough</i> started to spiral out of control, all while adhering to a strict visual construction (almost institutional in it's presentation). Marker's most overtly Marxist statements come in the final moments, the coda added in 1993, with the not-exactly-subtle images of wolves being shot from a plane. This is exactly what art can be, at its finest -- a way to examine history through subjective means, with a masterful ability for construction and an indefatigable voice.<br /><br />11 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Scenic Route<br />Mark Rappaport, USA , 1978<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Rappaport's little film is an interesting curiosity, but I didn't find it riveting. As a piece of avant-leaning filmmaking from late 70s America, it holds up, because I'm intrigued by that time period and Rappaport himself who is a strange and unrecognised figure in American cinema. The strict attention to artifice made this a tough watch in points, with the exaggerated representation of plot and classical allusions. It's a million miles away from being cynical or aloof, and thus felt even more like a fish out of water, especially compared to the arty cinema of today. Yet the dialogue and voiceover were so bland they seemed intentionally provocative, so there is an irony at play, though it's a different sort of irony than I was prepared for. This felt more like a work of performance art, with a broad theatricality that the cinematic treatment probably dampened instead of accentuated. As a female-centric film, written and directed by a man, it's probably easy to lob a criticism at it for being one-dimensional and pandering. If one were to apply that famous test about women in film - if they talk about anything beside men - then <i>The Scenic Route</i> would fail terribly. The only thing we learn about these characters is who they are sleeping with; we know nothing else about their identities, as they are only constructed by their relationships. But maybe that's precisely the point - not to make a comment on female representation in literature, but to set blinders around the narrative so no other concerns can filter in. I wasn't convinced, but there were very striking visuals - as striking as possible, given that they are mostly shot in one room and primarily use wallpaper for creative impact. I think I'm curious enough to try something else by Rappaport, though I'm not sure where to go next.<br /><br />13 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Other Side of Underneath<br />Jane Arden, UK , 1972<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Arden's film is pretty far-out, a much different beast than I expected. The first half, or maybe two-thirds, was a hypnotic, highly fractured work of psychosis on celluloid. Though a less kind reading could see it as an early version of <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> shot with underground film stylistic techniques applied. My feelings were somewhere in-between; I was enthusiastic for the bold stylistic choices, but I didn't find this moving, inspiring, or even all that interesting. From an intellectual standpoint I could probably convince myself that this is a sophisticated yet gonzo exploration of femininity in early 1970s Britain, as well as a critique of not just male-dominated institutions, but of the male-dictated art of film itself. But I could have probably written that before actually watching it; sitting through it did little for my own contemplations of such issues, which makes me wonder why I bothered. Certainly, this film's milieu and the fact it was directed by a woman gave it more importance than I would have attributed to it from the merits of the film itself. There were some dazzling sequences, for sure, but I was left unsure how to add it all up- which, if it was Arden's intention, given the subject matter, then kudos. I think this was an experimental theatre troupe performing, an all-female theatre who starred as the films beguiling young leads, and I can see how work like this could emerge from radical stage techniques. To her credit, Arden achieves something distinctly cinematic here, not merely documenting a theatrical work. The projection montages and nightmare scenes are as psychotropic as the best in horror cinema, though this clearly sees itself as far too sophisticated to fall into the horror genre. Yet many of its strategies, such as attempting to undercut the prurient with intensely disturbing psychologies, seem rote by today's standards. The evidence of the process of this film is all over it - the surely intense communal experiences, the raw sexuality, the shamanic approach to creation, and what's undeniably a blurring of boundaries between fiction and non-, especially evident in the final scenes outside. Yet I confess to getting bored multiple times, checking my email while I should have been enraptured by on-screen images which genuinely were unlike anything I had ever seen before. I'm sure in a few weeks I'll look back at this and decide it was one of the best things I've ever seen, but to get myself in the honest moment, I'm really just not sure what to make of it (which, in some ways, is the highest form of praise I can give a work of art).<br /><br />21 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Beaver<br />Jodie Foster, USA / United Arab Emirates , 2011<br />Location: Nida Art Colony room 208<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />The electricity was off all day for maintenance but I had enough battery life for one film, and for some odd reason I chose this. I remember when this came out, it was expected to be somewhat edgy based on the concept, but mostly because Mel Gibson starred in it, after his breakdown/freakout/anti-Semitic rants. But this was nothing like I expected -- I remembered it being previewed on comedy blogs, so I assumed it was a comedy, which it was not. Nor was it a challenging, introspective double-edged look at a celebrity and his problems, like <i>JCVD</i> or something like that. No, this was just a mediocre family-orientated drama that had a weird premise, which is continually made less and less quirky by the dull script, the clichéd plot devices, and the clunky editing. The only saving grace of this film, believe it or not, was Gibson's acting, which actually brought a convincing complexity to an otherwise unremarkable work. This is the second time I've been impressed by this douchebag's work, the first being his role as the psychiatrist in Robert Downey Jr.'s unnecessary remake of <i>The Singing Detective</i>. But was GIbson good enough to justify the time I wasted watching this? I couldn't even manage to fall asleep, sadly. And, Jodie Foster directed this, which is sort of weird. But the film itself is not weird, and I wish I had watched something else.<br /><br />22 May 2013<br />God's Country<br />Louis Malle, USA , 1986<br />Location: Nida Art Colony residency studio #3<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I should really start investing more time into the documentaries of Louis Malle, or maybe in his films overall. This looks at the small town of Glencoe, Minnesota, about 60 miles from Minneapolis, shot mostly in 1979 and then with an epilogue filmed in 1985. Malle approaches small-town Midwest America from an anthropological point-of-view, but because he engages the subjects in discussions personally, he's able to really get them to open up about their lives. It would have been so easy for him to make something mocking and exploitative, but there's no need -- he holds back, and lets a true, beautiful humanity shine through. Even when asking slightly more provocative questions about black people or homosexuality, he doesn't come across as a firebrand as much as someone who is genuinely curious. The result is neither judgemental nor boring, but oddly compelling. I was somewhat reminded of Louis CK's episode about Afghanistan, where he chose to hold back from any sort of political commentary and just let the situations explain themselves. Malle does this for the most part, though the epilogue appears to really critique Reagan's economic programmes, showing the impact of trickle-down economics on the Minnesota farmers after just one term of his administration. The final scene, with the father of the Vietnam activist talking about America's problem with greed, is explicitly opinion-based filmmaking and goes against what I said above, but I didn't mind it, because it's a beautiful scene and a great way to end this. Malle himself is really likeable, off-camera entirely in 1979 but there to warmly greet the people six years later. This film really is one of the most brilliant portrayals of the Midwest that I've ever seen, and put a warm smile on me throughout.<br /><br />23 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Lives of Performers<br />Yvonne Rainer, USA , 1972<br />Location: Nida Art Colony residency studio #3<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Being such a fan of <i>Journeys from Berlin/1971</i>, I had high expectations for <i>Lives of Performers</i>. This was every bit as challenging to watch, both because of it's formal experimentation and because it's a bit dull, but its exploration of the blurry lines between performance and reality didn't really speak much to me. I'm very much interested in the questions that plagued Rainer at this stage of her career, but her methodology did little to engage me, if anything driving me away from this as an interest. The plot was deliberately non-existent, meant to sneak away from understanding with every scene, and I watched this in several pieces despite it being fairly brief. The ending tableau is visually arresting, at least compared to the rest of the film and in context, but then my favourite Stones song ('No Expectations') suddenly starts blasting and it's all over. Very odd, but it doesn't add up to much; I'll take a brain intersection of psychoanalysis and political violence over this any day.<br /><br />25 May 2013<br />Tillsammans<br />Lukas Moodysson, Sweden / Denmark / Italy , 2000<br />Location: Nida Art Colony residency studio #3<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This has been on my list for some time but I never actually got around to watching it; I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. Moodysson's look at a 1970's post-hippie commune is fairly predictable. Of course we're going to see the pettiness of many of the lifestyle's habits, while also critiquing how anti-mainstream behaviour can affect children. That the children are more likeable and sophisticated than the adults wasn't anything surprising; having been around lifestyles like this plenty myself, I found the film's treatment to be fairly reductive, even though it tried its best to be sympathetic. The child actors were great, particularly the girl, and the film was easygoing enough that I didn't get bored. But as much as I hate to admit it, that mediocre Paul Rudd/Jennifer Aniston may have actually created a more realistic, less judgemental view of commune-based lifestyles. And it was significantly funnier as well.<br /><br />25 May 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Beeswax<br />Andrew Bujalski, USA , 2009<br />Location: Nida Art Colony residency studio #3<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />This was amazing, at least compared to the other Bujalski film i saw. I'm so used to Alex Karpovsky being an asshole on <i>Girls</i> that I couldn't help but read him as untrustworthy, even while playing a pretty all-around great guy. The twins in this film were both brilliant, and the Bujalski style managed to take similar concerns as <i>Funny Ha-Ha</i> (twenty-something girls, drifting through that decade) and inject it with narratives about dependency, trust, and ambition. The lo-fi style wasn't too lo-fi - here, meandering cameras and subtle, music-free sound mixes served to enhance the intimacy of the film. The paraplegic story wasn't a gimmick, nor did it take over from what this was. If anything, this felt like a beginning, and the non-conclusion, in a weird way, warmed my heart. Absolutely great.<br /><br />09 June 2013<br />Annie Hall<br />Woody Allen, USA , 1977<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Justin had never seen this so even though it was 4 AM we started watching it, which was a nice, easy bittersweet way to close a busy day. Both of us fell asleep 23 minutes before the end or so, so I finished watching this Sunday afternoon while listening to the birds singing outside. Not much more that can be said that hasn't been already; this is perfection, etcetera.<br /><br />09 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Cleo from 5 to 7<br />Agn&#xE8;s Varda, France / Italy , 1962<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>Cléo</i> is brilliant; moreso than I imagined it could be. Varda created a true French new wave <i>Ulysses</i>, down to the central 'chapter' focusing on the actions of the people she passes in Paris, just like the 'Lestrygonians' chapter. Also like <i>Ulysses</i>, this is a compendium of styles and moods, moving from pop music-based drama to pure romanticism, with this occultist overtone hanging over everything as is set in the opening scenes. Corinne Marchand does such a fantastic job of conveying a spoiled, superficial heroine that nonetheless evoked empathy in me. It's hard not to think of this as somewhat of a feminist take, not just because a woman made it but because of the way it privileges a female viewpoint and avoids the traditional leers of male-structured cinema. There's some really bizarre stuff happening in the margins, like the man on the street eating frogs or the baby carried by in an incubator. The films seems to flirt between light and heavy often within the same scene, and the weight of Cléo's future is immense, though this is a jaunty, fun film for the most part.<br /><br />09 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Incredible Burt Wonderstone<br />Don Scardino, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan new office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Way better than I expected, because it was actually funny. Constant tone shifts between cute, feelgood moments and really edgy funny stuff, but it worked enough to keep us entertained. Steve Carrell is only good once his character transforms into someone sympathetic; there's just no way he can sell a 'bad guy' role, so it doesn't really pick up until then. It's the most I've enjoyed Jim Carrey in years, but really it's Gandolfini who kills it. As broad comedies go this was definitely above average, because it's funny while avoiding easy, mean-spirited humour. The magic theme could have led to more bizarre and absurd humour but I guess this isn't the place for that. It made me want to watch that obscure Mitchell and Webb magician movie again.<br /><br />11 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Black Moon<br />Louis Malle, France / West Germany , 1975<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Malle's <i>Black Moon</i> is a stunning work of surrealism, but what does it mean? The obvious allegories seem too easy -- emerging sexuality, power, compromise -- but then, what else could it be? As one who is a fan of films like this, I'm starting to question what value they ultimately have in making me think and reflect upon the world. The imagery is great - I particularly enjoyed how this stayed rooted around a small house in the countryside, and used creepy insects and other animals to emphasise the disconnect between nature and civilisation. But when it's all over, apart from a pile of stunning images and a unique atmosphere, I don't know that I was inspired or moved. Of course this is more a product of my own personal changes than anything else, and I loved watching this. It's not without its troublesome aspects, as many of these films that feature a beautiful female protagonist have --Chabrol's <i>Alice</i>,  or <i>Valerie and Her Week of Wonders </i>or that Polanski film I never saw. Malle's vision isn't extremely exploitative, but it definitely comes from a very 'male' viewpoint, with Harrison's see-through blouse, breastfeeding scenes, and falling-down underwear. That duality of sexualising the hero is so bound up in French cinema that it's impossible to get away from it, and even Varda's <i>Cléo de 5 a 7</i> (which I watched yesterday) can be read that way if you're so inclined. Anyway, I also loved the juxtaposition between the dreamy, pastoral world and the horrible, 1970s violence outside of it, with the soldiers shooting each other along gender lines. It had that particularly dark 70s feel where the violence stems from boredom, mediocrity and system rather than pure evil, which in a way is even scarier. The pastoral landscape though is no less unpleasant - I haven't figured out yet if this is a horror film or fantasy piece. I could see myself watching this a few more times.<br /><br />15 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Down Terrace<br />Ben Wheatley, UK , 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I think I liked <i>Down Terrace </i>best of Ben Wheatley's three films; it was the most obviously a comedy, albeit an extremely fucking dark trip, and it dealt with a lot of the preoccupations of contemporary British cinema (crime, ugly working class domestic life, and withering traditions) while being extremely entertaining and not getting bogged down by any of these elements. I laughed a lot - the humour was not over-the-top or absurd, but really based in dry and realistic interactions between some very damaged, only slightly exaggerated people. The actors playing the main father and son characters were both phenomenal, and the use of traditional British folk music helped prevent the violence in this film from taking over and becoming too flashy. I wonder if i should watch <i>Kill List</i> again and see if it's actually a comedy and maybe I just didn't notice the first time.<br /><br />16 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks<br />Alex Gibney, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I didn't think I would find this interesting, but on the latest Harmontown podcast, Dan Harmon goes on and on about how great it is, so I thought it would be a nice way to wake up slowly on a Sunday afternoon. This was stunning, though I spent most of the film feeling like the filmmakers were missing the point about the value of Wikileaks; by the end, I realised what they were doing. The seemingly irrelevant focus on Assange the person was exactly the point -- that this focus on a person instead of a system was the fundamental problem on both sides of the argument. Assange's decline into a hypocritical egomaniac isn't surprising, nor is he portrayed with much sympathy, but the film suggests that this is inevitable in any such conflict, yet does so in a way that does not downplay the efforts of Wikileaks. Bradley Manning, in contrast, is portrayed as the true hero/victim that he likely is, and by the end we come to see that the Wikileaks story is about a much deeper theme than any one person can symbolise. In the wake of the PRISM whistleblowing, this is particularly interesting to view, and maybe hopefully some sort of lesson can be taken from this. I also liked how the NSA/CIA directors got to have their viewpoints represented, and they were much more nuanced than I would have expected.<br /><br />18 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Lock-Out<br />Antoni Padr&#xF3;s, Spain , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Padrós'<i>s Lock-Out</i> is only worth watching if you're interested in the products of this time which investigate political commitment against a failing European idealism (I am!) or the Spanish avant-garde under the dying days of Franco (I'm not, particularly). <i>Lock-Out</i> was over two hours long, shot on no-budget in high-contrast black and white, and often tedious in it's plotless explorations of ideology and gender roles. But Padrós keeps things light with a frequently shifting musical score, which sets the various scenes against opera, jazz, and pop forms, injecting an absurdity into the whole thing. I found this a curious piece, if not exactly exhilarating, though I started to question why I relate more to 40 year old art than contemporary work. It's not even about irony or commercialisation - there's more genuine, heartfelt expression being produced today than there was then, and this is a film bathed in irony (though relentless in its moral pursuits).<br /><br />18 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Femmes fatales<br />Bertrand Blier, France , 1976<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Men vs. women: the age-old battle. And also the understory of <i>Black Moon</i>, another French film I watched recently. Of all the Blier films I've seen, this is by far the most extreme in its satire. I wish I could say it was a masterpiece but it ended up feeling a bit like a more extreme version of <i>La grand bouffe</i>, though with food and sex swapped, and ascetic in terms of sex. The two protagonists are genuinely hilarious and some parts of this are utterly amazing, but the satirical commentary on gender relations is too thorny for me to completely at peace with it. Of course, exaggerated viewpoints are the way this works, but every female character in this film was just a cock-craving object, even when it's a film ostensibly about objectifying men. But: hilarious, genuinely boundary-pushing, and with the most ridiculous conclusion imaginable.<br /><br />19 June 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Gangster Squad<br />Ruben Fleischer, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />It's no surprise that <i>Gangster Squad</i> was lackluster, as the reviews of the time tipped me off. I'm enough of a fan of the west coast noir style that I wanted to watch it anyway, and this was all style and no substance. It wanted (I think) to parody the genre at times, but in a genre that is already somewhat self-parodic, this seemed especially pointless, with dialogue like "Who's the tomato?" and Sean Penn playing a dull, one-dimensional baddie whose viciousness isn't even interesting. Brolin and Gosling do an OK job at making their vigilante cop team feel heroic, though it's really Giovanni Ribisi who I enjoyed, (while the black and Mexican characters get zero personality/development). For a living cartoon, it was violent and quickly edited and I suppose it could have been more exploitative, so I'm glad that there wasn't Zack Snyder-style gore. The Chinatown scene is perhaps meant as some sort of reference or prequel to <i>Chinatown</i>, but as that's the best example of the genre and this may be the worst, it just served to remind me that I was wasting a perfectly good Wednesday night on the sofa with this. I should have just read a James Ellroy book instead.<br /><br />07 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    This Is the End<br />Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, USA , 2013<br />Location: Coca-Cola Plaza<br />Format: projection in cinema<br />It's nice to go sit in a cinema on a Sunday and for some reason Ags wants to come along even though she clearly had no interest in a film like this. I laughed consistently throughout, and I'm glad this avoided the ugly, nasty side of contemporayr comedy - even the jokes about rape walked a fine line and dealt with the subject delicately, if that can be believed. I put aside any sort of concerns that this film upholds Judeo-Christian mythology, because clearly that's just a premise to hang the jokes/comedy on -- and even the insider Hollywood circle-jerking wasn't bad. Strangely, this film got better as it left the "actors playing themselves" stuff behind and focused on being a compelling comedy-horror -- and I think of that genre, it ranks among the best, mostly because it's genuinely funny, and the horror was at the just the right level. But on the walk home, I started to think about how sad it is that these guys are the vanguard of cinematic comedy. I laugh like crazy any time Danny McBride says anything - <i>Eastbound and Down</i> has somehow transcended its form and become an infinitely returnable source of 'wisdom' - and I don't dislike any of these people. Yet I can't help but think about how in the past, the great comedians were about so much more than comedy. Woody Allen, Groucho Marx, Bob Newhart, Jerry Lewis -- their gifts were not just verbal/physical, but intellectual as well. A great comedian could convey a power and depth that no other art form could touch. The stars of <i>This is the End</i> are funny merely by their presence; I've just gotten used to them being around and being in everything, and the lines they deliver which they may or may not have written are delivered well, but it ends there. As funny as it was to see James Franco and Danny McBride arguing about ejaculation techniques, it's not an insightful, provocative comment about society or my own life or anything, really. Dick jokes are fine, and I'm thankful that this stayed away from brutal misogyny or excessive violence (seeing trailers for <i>Kick-Ass 2 </i>made me sick to my stomach, and I think I'm never going to watch a superhero film again, or at least not a supposed deconstruction of a superhero film, but I digress), but this was nothing more than light entertainment, not art. Michael Cera as a coked-up creep was hilarious, and the way that these actors played exaggerated versions of their public personas was what saved it, but they could have gone further. And it dragged a bit in the house scenes - a good 15 minutes could have been excised from this.<br /><br />08 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me<br />Drew DeNicola, Olivia Mori, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital download on monitor<br />I "rented" this from iTunes based on the rave reviews on Termbo but I'm not sure exactly what the fuck anyone was talking about. This was extremely standard, maybe even a bit below average, made in the way a student documentary would be. With apparently no surviving film of Big Star performing, the filmmaker used still photos, some of which were pretty amazing, and the occasional non-performance 16mm footage that was around. To this film's credit, the filmmaker did a great job of contextualising everything, and the film is almost about Memphis itself and it's weird musical history more than the band. Also the post-Big Star careers of Bell and Chilton aren't glossed over at all - and they did a pretty ok job of portraying Chilton's artistic decisions (at least as much as possible). Only about 10% of the talking heads had anything worthwhile to say. Jim Dickinson is fascinating and I wanted more unintelligible William Eggleston (and kudos for including excerpts of 'Stranded in Canton' which I still need to watch) and the famous alt-rockers are mostly kept to the bookends, so that's good, but still there's too many rock critics talking about how great the music is (and we're forced to watch one such douchebag play air drums), which I already know. I really, really love Big Star and it's always great to hear these songs, especially as the soundtrack included a lot of rare takes and other versions. But at times I felt like I'd rather just be looking at an online slideshow and listening to the records without the constant irrelevant interruptions. I thought the film would portray Bell as the troubled genius, and of course it does a little, but they really show Chilton as the absolute artist here, and that's done without overtly stating that opinion. Although maybe this is my own viewpoint coming through - the more I listen to <i>Dusted in Memphis</i> and <i>Like Flies on Sherbert</i> (which have been in my rotation lately) the more I start to see how 'complete' the guy's career was, even though it seems to be filled with tossed-off jokes and less than genuine enthusiasm for most of the last twenty years of his life. The fact that someone could make <i>Third</i> and then just move on like that is actually something we should all strive for. Chilton's decision to reform Big Star in the 90s was almost certainly motivated by money and the talking heads take great pains to avoid saying that, instead trying to talk about him marching to his own beat, etc. But no one wanted to state the truth, and this general timidity is what keeps this film from taking any chances and makes it yet another limp-dick hagiography. It was great to see Chilton's Panther Burns era included, including an amazing local TV appearance (with him introduced as "Axel Chitlon") which is by far the highlight of the whole film. This all builds up to a lame tribute concert with famous alt-rock people, which was supposedly done because "it's what Alex would have wanted" (my paraphrase) when probably nothing could be further from the truth. These music documentaries follow such a standard form that I really want to see something new with the structure. And the supposed 'tragedy' of Big Star (the band, not referring to Bell's death or anyone else's) is that they never got big, but actually they are a huge band, properly enshrined in the rock canon, and even at the time they got reviews and found fans. They just never became superstars - they never became the next Rolling Stones - and that's precisely why the resonated with so many people. The only true tragedy is that everyone's expectations were too high, just like they were for me with this film.<br /><br />08 July 2013<br />Before Sunrise<br />Richard Linklater, USA / Austria / Switzerland , 1995<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />I've never seen this or its sequel and now there's a third so I thought it might be time to catch up. Why did I bother? This has the same high-school philosophical discussions that I hated about <i>Waking Life</i>, though with a super annoying Ethan Hawke strutting about like a post-grunge douchebag and generally making me wish nothing but misery and suffering on his character. Delpy is cute but can't sell the trite, faux-introspective dialogue and this just drags on and on. Maybe I don't believe in romance anymore but I found this completely insufferable; I only finished it because I was lying in bed too lazy to get up and start my day. The highlight of this film was definitely the Unsane poster in the bar while they played pinball. I would have rather this left Hawke/Delpy and followed the two actors who they meet upon first arriving, <i>Slacker</i>-style. I don't think I'll ever watch the sequels and I should make a note to never watch <i>Slacker</i> again either, because I have fond memories of it, but I saw it when I was 15 so that's probably how I should leave it.<br /><br />10 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Games<br />Curtis Harrington, USA , 1967<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file via projector<br />Wow! What an incredible film. I've never seen anything by Harrington before but this makes me want to see everything. It's easy to read this as a basic feminist argument - the wife's unraveling comes through her own sexual repression, her loss of utility through being idle and wealthy, and her domestic space closing in and all that. But Harrington seems determined to keep switching things up whenever it starts to feel sensible, and the tone of this was always elusive. It reminded me of the <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> vibe, with the Ruth Gordon-like figure, affluent young couple, same time period and most of the film taking place inside a nice house. But I much, much preferred <i>Games</i> because it manages to parody a lot of cliches of thriller/horror films while being really something entirely different, and the artistic qualities of the film were off the charts. Harrington's use of the camera is as playful as the titular games, with lots of motion, trickery, and some really beautiful (and also some gonzo) montages. There's more doorway shots than the most recent season of <i>Mad Men</i> and we're frequently seeing the action through a window or other occluding device. The young Jimmy Caan is pretty smooth and the love between the two of them is made quite convincing, which makes everything all the more twisted. There's so many levels on which this works that I think I'll watch it again; Simone Signoret's scenes usually steal the show and have some great, great bits in them.<br /><br />12 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Parker<br />Taylor Hackford, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />I was going to this big culture festival at Patarei prison tonight, but then I realised that it costs 20€ for a ticket and it was just local people, not that I don't want to support local people but I didn't want to support it *that* much. So what's the next-best thing to do? Stay in and watch a Jason Statham movie! <i>Parker</i> is the latest adaptation of a character from some novels I've never read, though it doesn't really seem like much of a stretch from every other Jason Statham character - he's mysteriously, relentlessly competent, and lives by a code. This was a shitty film, of course, but could have transcended the average Statham fare if the dialogue had been slightly better written. As a thriller/heist film, the plot was good enough and Jennifer Lopez actually tries to act well (but can only do so much with the shitty dialogue she's given). The stunts and action sequences are fine - the hotel fight is particularly brutal, definitely the highlight - and Statham kicks ass, which is what he's supposed to do. Nick Nolte is a horribly grizzly, barely intelligible father figure, and the scenes in small town Ohio are pretty nice. The trailers for this had me hoping it would be a bit like <i>Fletch</i>, with the various disguises and accents, but that was under-explored (as funny as it is to see Statham attempting a Texas drawl). Definitely better than <i>The Mechanic</i> and probably on par with the best parts of the <i>Transporter</i> trilogy, and still a far cry from <i>The Bank Job.</i><br /><br />13 July 2013<br />The Friends of Eddie Coyle<br />Peter Yates, USA , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />For some reason I mistakenly thought this was a British film, but it's Boston all the way. The frumpy, middle-aged Mitchum is pretty sad-sack and still maintains something badass about him even though he's a far cry from <i>Night of the Hunter</i>. I would always be happy to have more Peter Boyle, but he finally emerged in the closing moments and saved the day. It's a great Boston film, with some awesome hockey scenes of a young Bobby Orr, gritty dialogue, and a few bank robberies as well. The perspective shifted throughout, suggesting an omnipresence for the viewer that turned out to be misleading. But this isn't a film for fancy tricks - it's a film to soak up the decrepit mid-70s American atmosphere. You couldn't make a more definitive '70s film' if you tried.<br /><br />14 July 2013<br />The Outfit<br />John Flynn, USA , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />Only in 1973 could a film be financed where the two male leads are Robert Duvall and Joe Don Baker. Though at this earlier stage in their careers, they are sort of handsome, if a far cry from the traditional leading man. <i>The Outfit</i> has a lot of scenes of Duvall shooting dudes and then Joe Don being his friendly accomplice, but the pleasures I found were in the way they engaged in social interactions with the various lowlifes and criminals attached to their world. The scene where they go to buy the car is hilariously staged, with the half-wit brother, evil/voluptuous wife, and mean dog -- and yet somehow they escape without any real harm coming to either of them. The finale is anti-climactic, to put it mildly, and I kept waiting for a twist that never came. This was a pan-and-scan version possibly from TV and I sort of wished it looked better, but I doubt I'd ever watch this again even if it was released in a better format. Which is not to say I didn't enjoy it - it was pretty great, as these things go - and quite thematically similar with films I've been watching for the last few days.<br /><br />16 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Angel City<br />Jon Jost, USA , 1977<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This is my first experience with Jon Jost apart from his short, <i>Canyon</i>, and I was way, way into this. This is a film about Los Angeles (a city which I've read so much about and seen so many films about, yet have never been to) built around a vapid murder mystery and shot on essentially no budget. This was a very experimental take on narrative form, often using the supposed plot as an excuse for performative experiments (such as having an intentionally bad actress practicing her lines and slowly breaking down) and poetic travelogues. The aerial and driving shots of the city, over which an impressionistic text is monotonously intoned, were mesmerising. By the end I didn't care at all about the mystery, but I loved the intentional-pretending-to-be-unintentional comedy of the lead actor, playing the private eye Frank Goya; the use of overlaid text and other visual gestures, and the lighthearted (yet intensely ambitious) feel. I'm definitely going to investigate more of his work immediately.<br /><br />18 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Offence<br />Sidney Lumet, UK / USA , 1972<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I never had the slightest idea that this film existed or was so intense. Connery is in full-on <i>Zardoz</i> mode in intensity and appearance, but you can see how a different plot and script can make such a difference. His performance in this was incredible - unquestionably the most powerful acting I've ever seen by Connery, and one that makes me really think of his as a great actor (as opposed to a great movie star). The setting and grisly content reminded me of the <i>Red Riding </i>quartet, or at least the first novel which is the only one I've read, though the police in this were far from corrupt and the drama was much more psychological. The final act of this was so compelling that I was pretty much frozen with attention, though actually the opening pre-credit sequence pretty much had me.<br /><br />19 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Birds<br />Alfred Hitchcock, USA , 1963<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />Is this a masterpiece of the horror genre, or just Hitchcock's version of <i>The Happening</i>? I've never seen this all the way through before, and I enjoyed it throughout because all Hitchcock films have at least some level of interesting/entertaining subtexts to enjoy. In this case, this tried to explore loneliness and independence, but with some awesomely grisly bird attacks and wonderfully dated-feeling green screen technology. Tippi Hedren gets a little bit annoying, but Rod Taylor's perfect for this somewhat wooden role. This probably left audiences unsatisfied, but that final shot is so, so beautiful. There's a nicely unrealised homosexual element to Taylor's character too, I think, though maybe I just perceive Hitch as always being somewhat devilish like that, and I expect the same deconstruction of masculinity found in <i>Vertigo</i> to appear in this other Northern California-set film. The town is so 100% white that it's impossible to look at this now without seeing some allegory about the stranger coming to town and disrupting their perfect community, even if the stranger (in this case) is an affluent blonde white woman.<br /><br />20 July 2013<br />Horrible Bosses<br />Seth Gordon, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I put this on to half-watch while doing menial things around the office - sewing up the couch cushions, filing receipts -- and I ended up abandoning my tasks to properly watch this. I did actually enjoy most of this, which is not to say that it was a masterpiece or even close, but it wasn't terrible, which is what I expected. The misogyny quotient was unpleasantly high, as it usually is when Jason Sudekis is involved. The total list of female characters with speaking roles is: oblivious prop (Charlie Day's fiancée), sex-crazed psychopath (Jennifer Aniston, with a small enough part that she managed to be funny), sex-crazed prop (Kevin Spacey's wife), and butt of a fat joke (woman at the office). The stereotypes could have been better - Jamie Foxx is full-on caricature but the <i>Snow Falling on Cedars </i>reveal is the film's funniest moment; Colin Farrell hints at some real comic chops but his character is an underused cartoon. Because Charlie Day is so funny, and played essentially a literate version of his character on <i>Always Sunny</i>, I kept finding myself laughing unexpectedly at his quips, and Jason Bateman still hasn't used up all the goodwill he generated from <i>Arrested Development</i>. If this had been done by more ambitious writers, this could be a great farce built around the same concept, but here it was just by-the-books mainstream comedy. But for a Saturday morning distraction, it worked.<br /><br />19 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Smashed<br />James Ponsoldt, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Ponsoldt's film is a real treat - in many ways a conventional 'independent' film of the era, with a soundtrack that could be in a Volkswagen commercial and focusing on 20somethings with a creative, arty lean to their lifestyles, but one that is so delicate and compelling that I felt at times like I was watching a documentary. This is a film that explores the role of romantic relationships in supporting or inhibiting recovery from addiction, which is a topic that's of interest to me (having one parent who quit drinking 20 years ago and another who did not). Winstead is superb and Aaron Paul is in full-on Jesse Pinkman mode, which is perfect for this setting, and I could have taken more of him. Amazingly, Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally appear without any comic element to their characters, and Offerman in particular really comes through and shows a range far beyond his usual self. While this is a thoughtful, probing film dealing with a serious topic, I felt it could have taken a few more chances. The off-kilter camera angles, swerving drunkenly at the beginning and gradually straightening out as Winstead does, are such an obvious technique that I found it more distracting than creative; still, the script is very carefully written and avoids easy characterisations. I emailed my Dad when this was over to recommend it as I'm curious how his own experience parallels this film.<br /><br />20 July 2013<br />            Hearts of the West<br />Howard Zieff, USA , 1975<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Doug recommended this very, very odd film which tried so hard to be a satirical comedy and managed to be neither funny nor satirical. A fresh-faced, naieve Jeff Bridges (who looked so much like a more attractive Tim Heidecker then) is obsessed with writing Westerns and ends up involved in B-movie productions of them in the 1930s. Alan Arkin's comic talents are irrepressible and the reason this was good; Andy Griffith was an odd casting choice and fails to convince as Bridges' mentor. Blythe Danner is sorta fetchin' in a Great Depression way, and the sheer oddity of the cast (a bizarrely-accented Donald Pleasance rounds it out) and my overall love for 70s 'forgotten yuks' made me love this. But it's a misstep in many ways, with one of the biggest being that I can't imagine what the audience would have been for this. The oft-told allegory of the innocent seduced by Hollywood is one thing, but Bridges fails to be seduced, really, and the whole thing comes full-circle without any payoff. Great!<br /><br />20 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Our Idiot Brother<br />Jesse Peretz, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I suspected this would be a two-star comedy where Rudd plays a broad, lazily-written character but instead found a fairly smart dramedy with a talented ensemble cast that almost achieves being memorable. The script does a good job of sketching characters who have exaggerated traits (bossy, promiscuous, dickish, etc.) but are more fleshed out than mere caricatures. Rudd's character, at the centre of it all, is actually probably the least fleshed out, but Rudd portrays him with such a humanity that it's easy to forget this is the same guy from <i>Anchorman</i> and lots of other dumb movies. The tone shifts between more comedic parts (which are good) and the family drama (which is so-so). Steve Coogan never seems to find his footing in American films and I don't really understand why. Most of the actors and actresses fall into what they usually do; Adam Scott as the everyman slacker (Scott is supposed to be a nerd here, like his character on <i>Parks and Rec</i>, which I also don't buy), Zooey Deschanel as the flighty pixie (though she's better than usual); TJ Miller as the doofus, and Elizabeth Banks being uptight and sharp. I didn't love this but it was certainly inoffensive; the tone shifts and juxtaposition between fairly realistic New York lifestyles and Rudd's utter obliviousness are sometimes jarring and I think this could have benefited from some script doctoring. But overall, not a bad time.<br /><br />21 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Bling Ring<br />Sofia Coppola, USA / UK / France / Germany / Japan , 2013<br />Location: Coca-Cola Plaza<br />Format: projection in cinema<br />Or, in Estonia, <i>Blinga ringa</i> which is a better title. Not sure how I really felt about this film; Coppola's style of pulling back and letting the film "speak" for itself, almost documentary style, echoed the vapidity of the characters, but I could have enjoyed more of a critique of this culture. Of course, there's not really anything for me to learn about how horrible celebrity-obsessed teenagers are; if there's any viewpoint in this film, maybe the suggestion is that bad parenting is to blame, given the whackjob nature of Leslie Mann's character and the relative lack of parenting elsewhere in the film. But this seems a bit too easy, much like the heists were. I got a bit bored during the (seemingly endless) scenes of robberies and trying on clothing; this brutal repetition was probably the point (or maybe I just have a fairly low tolerance for such scenes) but my interest wasn't sustained. There was maybe only one or two shots that were enjoyable, most memorable the long-distance through-the-windows scene of one robbery, untouched by soundtrack intrusions for a brief moment of calm during the whirlwind of blown-out pop music and other superficial sense-battery. Any curiosity I had in seeing <i>Spring Breakers</i> might be sated by this, though I suspect <i>Breakers</i> is the more interesting film.<br /><br />25 July 2013<br />Five Easy Pieces<br />Bob Rafelson, USA , 1970<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />It's crazy I've never seen this, given my longstanding interest in American cinema of the 1970s and its place among the pantheon of great films. It was pretty much as I expected, which was "great", though maybe a lot more distant from a counter-cultural context than I would have imagined. Nicholson's just a fuse that can explode at any point, not necessarily in violence, but in a mania that only he can bring to a role. I haven't seen <i>Easy Rider</i> in years, but this is actually a much more interesting premise, though still around the idea of 'dropping out', where it's presented much less attractively. It doesn't seem like any of the characters in this film grow or develop at all, which makes this a surreptitiously depressing exercise. At times, the tone of the script seems as aimless as Nicholson -- veering between comedic elements (such as when the hitchhikers are picked up) and heavy drama with nothing to differentiate. I don't know if I liked this as much as <i>The King of Marvin Gardens</i> but they're quite different beasts.<br /><br />26 July 2013<br />The Killing Kind<br />Curtis Harrington, USA , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Just a few years after <i>Games</i> and Harrington has sunk into low-budget sleaze with no-name actors, but this retains the same inventive brilliance and manages to transcend the genre entirely. It's a thriller with no thrills, or maybe a horror film where the only horror is Oedipal. The repressed sexuality from John Savage explodes in some really unpleasant ways, and it's hard to take much from <i>The Killing Kind</i> except a morbid fascination. This is a very dark, very uncommercial film and again features a heavyset older woman in a domineering lead role. I dug this in the most depraved of manners, and it will resonate with me far longer than the typical slasher/horror flick would. I will probably see all of Harrington's work now.<br /><br />27 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    RSO [Registered Sex Offender]<br />Bob Byington, USA , 2008<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This comedy was done in the mockumentary style and using consumer-grade camcorder, but it somehow worked. The premise, to explore the difficulty of a registered sex offender rehabilitating into society, was a good one, but this took the easy, comic route throughout. The lead character was brilliant, though - reminding me a lot of my friend McDowell, and I'm glad they didn't try to downplay his creepyness or make him more sympathetic. A lot of the setups were really easy, cheap comedy pieces and while actually funny, seemed too easy - yet McIver's brilliant disinterest managed to make it work. This was definitely lightweight and I'd like to see this topic tackled by a more serious filmmaker, but the same sense of absurdity I found in Byington's other film was present here, plus you had Nick Offerman and Andrew Bujalski bringing some professional chops to the role. I wouldn't recommend this or watch it again, but it was surprisingly watchable for a Saturday morning "just woke up, too lazy to start my day" exercise.<br /><br />27 July 2013<br />The Crazies<br />George A. Romero, \nUSA , 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I think <i>The Crazies</i> was pretty much perfect; Romero manages to act out all sorts of survivalist fantasies of people vs. army in a Western Pennsylvanian terrain, though the politics are fairly left wing. From the beginning you know there's no hope, and while these weren't exactly zombies the same sort of spreading terror is present as in the <i>Dead</i> films. I think the scariest scenes were shot in broad daylight, in big open fields. Though the acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, this nails the people's distrust of the government (just before Watergate) and their disillusionment with Vietnam into a perfect horror hybrid. And it's perfect that bureaucracy prevents the cure from being discovered, and cynicism from detecting the immune hero.<br /><br />28 July 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Goodbye Uncle Tom<br />Gualtiero Jacopetti, Franco Prosperi, Italy , 1971<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I had seen a few clips of this before so I should have known to expect a big-budget piece with surprisingly high production values. But nothing quite prepared me for this, a film that really can't be classified in any category whatsoever. Despite the closing credit of 'this film is a documentary', of course it's far from one, though it's adamant that all the text comes from historical sources. The imagery here is genuinely shocking, even in the context of a 'Mondo' movie; the violence and brutality is true, never cartoonish, and the directors are unwavering in their condemnation of slavery throughout. The ambiguity in this message happens because Jacopetti and Prosperi are exploitation filmmakers at heart, and they're unable to stop the camera from lingering on nude bodies or bloody beatings long enough to lend their viewpoint the proper gravitas. Though the castration was thankfully off-screen, everything else in here comes in classic Italian exploitation style, albeit with impeccable photography and an army of extras that must have been a feat to assemble. This is a long film, 136 minutes, and the endless scenes of interracial sex and forced breeding could have definitely been shorter, but then again, there's a reason people were buying tickets in 1971. I like how the film bounced between contemporary America and the historical recreations, even if it stopped to focus on drag queens and naked performance artists for awhile (seemingly forgetting which Mondo film this was supposed to be). The ending segment with the diaries of Nat Turner is incredibly intense and amazingly the part that was censored at the time (while rape, force-feeding, the aforementioned castration, and having teeth pulled out was apparently A-OK). Unforgettable.<br /><br />28 July 2013<br />Capturing the Friedmans<br />Andrew Jarecki, \nUSA , 2003<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />It's been a decade since I saw this but I had fond memories, and somehow the topic came up and I thought it would be worth revisiting. Few documentaries would hold up to a second viewing but this was every bit as compelling, and I went into it with a totally different viewpoint here, since now I know that Jarecki really did have a viewpoint and tried his damndest to make it seem unbiased. I've written before about how I think that's actually the most manipulative filmmaking of all, but maybe I was being too harsh. Others have written about the moral quandary of withholding information, either for or against Jesse Freidman's case, but I don't think Jarecki committed any great sin. This really is an artistically powerful documentary film and the ambiguity is much more than a marketing ploy - it's the essence of the film. Now it's been a decade, and recently Jesse Friedman attempted to have his conviction vacated, and an independent investigation team upheld the original ruling. I don't know what to believe - I only have the information presented to me in this film (and from the DVD special features), and surely the investigators had far more information. Obviously, taking the guilty plea fucked him over beyond repair and he'll never have the chance to properly go to trial, so the guy's life is essentially ruined, and that is certainly a tragedy if he's innocent. But no one can say for sure, and even though this makes a convincing filmic argument (in a restrained way), I have no place to judge myself. Stylistically, it's refreshing how this was relatively spare, with a few embellishments (the rotating top when talking about hypnosis, in particular) but no re-enactments (thankfully) and none of the flash and spectacle that seems to have infected documentary cinema today.<br /><br />03 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Hell Baby<br />Robert Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Most of y'all disliked this, and I'm completely sick of "horror-comedy" (though I will go see the new Edgar Wright film, when it opens) so I had low expectations which were again exceeded. I think that's the key to these dumb comedies - to not expect anything, and then you might laugh a bit. I did; there were some great absurdities here, and a good cast of comedic actors who can deliver their lines well. I'm pretty sure Lennon and Garant wrote this movie purely so they could play Vatican priests, yet they aren't quite comfortable in the roles - so much more could have been done. Scheer and Huebel, playing cops with each others' nametags, are mostly hilarious and actually manage to bring something new to the the "wacky cops" thing. Agreed that Corddry again fails to impress, here trying to play the straight man - I think his success on <i>The Daily Show</i> is because he was a dick in pointed, political pieces. When trying to riff on pure absurdity, he can't sustain himself longer than an 11-minute<i> Childrens Hospital</i> episode. Yet another <i>Exorcist</i> spoof; yet another film parodying the conventions of horror films which are already self-parody. Yawn, yawn, but a few bits were inspired ('pizza salad"!).<br /><br />14 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Paradise: Faith<br />Ulrich Seidl, Austria / Germany / France , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />The second part of Seidl's trilogy was just unpleasant to sit through, and did nothing for me emotionally, artistically or even as entertainment. It has a similar pace and construction as <i>Paradise: Love</i>, but set in drab Austrian flats instead of the lush colours of the Kenyan coast. As someone who already suffered enough under the misery of Catholicism, I didn't need Seidl to tell me that Christianity (and Catholicism in particular) is a torturous psychological hell that I hope one day the human race evolves beyond. Seeing this play out was slow and miserable, and at times I felt like I was flagellating myself as was the lead character. They should have called this <i>Paradise: Abuse</i>, as the last half-hour is just screaming (yet low-key) agony. Of course, I'll likely watch the third one because I like to complete things.<br /><br />15 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Mutual Appreciation<br />Andrew Bujalski, USA , 2005<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I've been reading tons of reviews of Bujalski's new film<i>,</i> <i>Computer Chess</i>, which unfortunately I can't see for awhile. I'm anxious, so I thought of watching the film of his I hadn't seen before, which has turned out to be my pick of his three. One of the reviews of <i>Chess</i> said that his earlier films, while seemingly about aimless 20-somethings, etc, are really full of examples of him playing with the medium of film, albeit in a low-budget way. So I went into <i>Mutual Appreciation</i> looking for evidence of formal experimentation, but found little, apart from the archaic camera and medium he shot it on. I think I was downplaying the plot for the first half, which seemed like a typical concern of the whole mumblecore/my generation of filmmakers -- guy in an indie band moves to the city, has feelings for his friend's girlfriend, is somewhat wrapped up in his own myopic self-awareness, etc. And yeah, this is fairly played-out subject matter at this point; while watching this I felt like I'd seen it a million times. But really, the more I thought about it, I've lived these exact sequences a million times in my younger life: going to a drummer's basement to feel out playing music together, going to some weird dude's apartment after a show and not quite being sure why you are there, wandering into a random party where some strange women want to put makeup on you. I didn't love this completely because of these moments, which I'm not sure are worthwhile enough experiences to make art from (and Bujalski really keeps a distance from making any commentary or resolutions). But somehow a partial balance of the plot/acting (where Bujalski himself was brilliant, the most I've enjoyed him as an actor by far and he sort of stole the spotlight of his own film) and the overall vibe (the black and white, often horrible-looking compositions, though I believe this was done expertly despite what it may seem) made this really incredibly satisfying.<br /><br />16 August 2013<br />The Guatemalan Handshake<br />Todd Rohal, \nUSA , 2006<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This oddity starred WIll Oldham (though he wisely stayed out of the picture as much as possible) and also had a small part by Cory McAbee, who also loaned his comic sensibility. A series of comedic misfires, this fails to hold itself together in even a slightly interesting manner, leaving it nothing more than a series of awkward set pieces built around things that I didn't find funny (awkward kids, weird cars, strange accents) and the occasional moment of obvious surrealism (a woman attending her own funeral). i stopped caring a half-hour in, and by the end of it I had completely lost interest, so the fireworks-and-demolition derby climax was of little interest. I like the small town Pennsylvania setting and I have a high tolerance for quirkiness, but this wasn't even as good as a Quentin Dupieux film.<br /><br />16 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Quick Change<br />Howard Franklin, Bill Murray, USA , 1990<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />It's been at least twenty years since I've seen this, and not only does it hold up well, but I actually remembered most of it. Except my memory was that they didn't get away with it, which didn't really matter. Randy Quaid was less enjoyable that I expected but Murray kills it, and Robards is a good foil. Murray's clown bank robber is just brilliantly assholish and once they actually get out of the bank it loses a bit of steam. This is a film that would be completely impossible today due to current communications technology, as are most things I watch probably, but at least that should prevent a remake. This was probably overshadowed by <i>Groundhog Day</i> (which is amazing) and <i>What About Bob? </i>(which is not as good as <i>Quick Change</i>, or at least I don't think so). Nice small roles by Norman from <i>The Wire</i>, as well as Stanley Tucci and Phil Hartman (RIP!).<br /><br />10 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Alexander the Last<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I've finally seen something by Joe Swanberg and it was pretty impressive in an understated way. This is a film that moves around a good bit, but following an intangible emotional intensity throughout. The lead actress brought everything to the role, and this emphasised sensations over plot or actions. Maybe this could be seen as lazy filmmaking, but I was impressed by its seriousness and how warm it was. This was probably the first of the so-called 'mumblecore' films I've seen that actually had a lot of mumbling in it, but the technical composition wasn't sloppy or amateurish - if anything, the crisp digital images were carefully assembled to put the most emotional character forth from each frame. This isn't radical filmmaking, but just the next descension from whatever Cassavetes started with <i>Faces</i>. I was talking with Juuso last night about it feels like the vanguard of European cinema (Von Trier, Carax, Haneke, Seidl for example) now is so concerned with pushing boundaries, making grand statements, and transgressive visions, while what I've liked best about recent America cinema is the exact opposite. This is cinema of the mundane, an introspection that looks for pleasures in the small places and leaves the bombast behind. It's odd how this seems to be a role reversal from what I'd expect from these continents but maybe this is just what I've been watching and not indicative of the whole of cinema.<br /><br />18 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Aaltra<br />Gustave de Kervern, Beno&#xEE;t Del&#xE9;pine, Belgium / France , 2004<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Talk about 'black comedy' - this was so deadpan that it felt somewhat derivative, and with the plot taking the characters to Finland it seems like a bit of Kaurismäki worship for sure (and he has a cameo in this after all). But the French language and the rival/buddy dichotomy made this an update of <i>Les valseuses</i>, as Blier's style of humour is very much alive and well. The crisp monochrome photography gave this the air of an art film, at first reminding me of Veiko Õunpuu's last film, though that's soon abandoned for a series of comic adventures, some successful and some not. A few moments had me in stitches, and the final gag (which the entire film is essentially a long buildup towards) is such a great comic payoff that I ultimately decided I loved this film.<br /><br />18 August 2013<br />When We Were Kings<br />Leon Gast, USA , 1996<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This is often atop lists of 'best sports documentaries', but the joy of <i>When We Were Kings </i>lies in the archival footage - namely, the music of James Brown/BB King and the taunting boasts of Muhammad Ali. It's shocking that this was released in 1996, because it feels like an item from a million years ago - the film stock used even for the later interviews dates it incredible, almost like it was artificially aged. The talking heads are kept to a minimum here, allowing the footage from Zaïre '74 to tell everything. Having read the Norman Mailer account, this was a perfect complement, with Mailer and Plimpton making their presence felt but not in an overbearing way. The footage of the fight itself isn't that much of it - only about five minutes of screen time - but that's plenty, and they do a good job of explaining Ali's tactical genius. There's little of Foreman in Zaïre, and it's understandable giving how much Ali dominated the proceedings. There's some pontificating about Ali's role as a "political leader" which I've always thought was pretty dubious, for as great and important as it was for Ali to be the voice of protest against Vietnam, he was far from informed. Foreman's ego is no slouch either but it's actually dwarfed by Ali's in the run-up to the fight; Foreman attempts to portray himself as the high-road taking, humble hero (as would anyone against Ali) though it's not the most convincing performance. Ali's act is one of entertainment and it's put into context more when you see the reporters laughing and Ali, like any star of show business, feeding off the energy of the crowd and riffing a bit. The ethics of associating with the Mubutu regime are only slightly addressed here, glossed over in favour of hot air proclaiming the Zaïre festival as a great advance in black culture. Despite all this, I was riveted by this.<br /><br />20 August 2013<br />Clear History<br />Greg Mottola, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan blue room<br />Format: digital file on iPad<br />Watched while bottling homebrew. Though a made-for-TV movie, this was far far better than 90% of cinematic comedies. It actually makes sense that they wouldn't bother with a theatrical release, because the comedy film, if not completely dead, is certainly a dinosaur on its way out. This didn't stylistically differ from a theatrical film, though. Mottola is a pretty decent director and while this was largely improvised (the script was apparently 35 pages), it felt as cohesive as a great episode of <i>Curb</i>, and Michael Keaton is such a pleasure to see these days. It's nice to see McBride playing a slightly different character than he usually does, though he still hasn't gone against type or anything yet.<br /><br />21 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Un Flic<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France / Italy , 1972<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Melville's last film is much more distant than his others, maybe because it was the final chapter for him? Alain Delon returns with the same glowing charisma as in <i>Le Samouraï</i>, but here on the other side of the law. As much as I enjoy everything by Melville, his colour films are the winners. The man was a visual genius, and <i>Un Flic</i> is bathed in grey and blue shades, employing a cool feel of Paris in the rain. There's a lot of shots of empty, lonely urban streets and there's so little backstory to any of the characters (Delon's romance with Deneuve is only fleeting and not given much screen time) that the whole film seems almost anti-human. The heist on the train is the highlight, and even that is fairly subdued - plus the scale model helicopter/train shots were so fake looking that I found it hard to suppress my laughter. Like <i>Le Samuraï</i>, we get some lovely indoor police station office/bureaucracy shots, though without the same feeling of being in a maze.<br /><br />21 August 2013<br />A Fantastic Fear of Everything<br />Crispian Mills, Chris Hopewell, UK , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This was pretty dreadful - a Simon Pegg vehicle obviously intended to show the macabre stylistic sensibilities of the filmmakers, but they forgot to put a story in there. Most of this film centres around Pegg's attempt to do laundry and when the actual 'thriller' element comes in, it doesn't really fit. The climax is a claymation fantasy and I don't think I laughed once through the whole thing. Pegg is such an affable performer that I actually felt bad for him.<br /><br />28 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Price Check<br />Michael Walker, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Not much purpose to this - unless you're really interested in how supermarkets market themselves - beyond Parker Posey just spazzing out for 90 minutes. Her performance is awesome, and funny enough to make this feel like 'comedy'. The attempts to have ageing characters cling onto their past loves in music reminded me of Paul Rudd's equally bland character in <i>This is 40</i>, though with Dean Wareham substituted for Graham Parker. I spent this film flipping between extremely entertained (Posey really brings a subtlety to her mania) and extremely bored whenever she wasn't on-screen.<br /><br />28 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Pain &#x26; Gain<br />Michael Bay, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I think this is the first Michael Bay film I've ever seen and it was every bit as repellant as I expected. Yet, at the same time, I can't deny the man's talent at making compelling entertainment. This had the same high-velocity editing and camera gimmickry that populates many of today's motion pictures, yet it's a bit closer to the benevolent Edgar Wright style than whomever directed <i>Crank 2: High Voltage</i>. I really dislike Mark Wahlberg but this is probably the best performance of his I've seen - he's perfect as this dimwitted meathead, who doesn't have to sell the comedy because it's in the situations, not the delivery. The Rock I am a fan of (call it a guilty pleasure) and once again, he's way too good for a script this dumb, but sells it well. This is based on a true story and the boneheads-attempting-crime thing has been done many, many times but in Bay's hands it loses any ability to function as art, seeming to miss its own point. This satire practically writes itself, but Bay seems unconcerned with any sort of viewpoint - it's all about racist, sexist and homophobic cheapshots. I admit that I laughed a few times, but usually felt terrible for doing so. In the hands of a more sophisticated auteur, we could have something better, but I guess the Coens already made that and it was called <i>Burn After Reading</i>. While that film's dark cynicism was (in my opinion) justified by its commentary (and was way funnier), <i>Pain &amp; Gain</i> is a steroid-laden mess, too vacuous to even make an attempt. Watched while waiting for a long database migration script to complete.<br /><br />30 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    LOL<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2006<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I keep wanting to dismiss these 'mumblecore' films as slight and throwaway, but <i>LOL</i> was probably the best exploration of sexuality in the digital age that I've ever seen. Since it's shot on consumer cameras and looks worse than amateur, it's easy to be deceived; however, the acting and editing was so carefully constructed that I saw this as a very well-made product. You couldn't capture 2005 more perfectly - the flip phones and experimental pop music and all that - and while this is a fairy straight, seemingly surface-level story, Swanberg manages to get quite a lot out of these performers. Greta Gerwig, who we only get the voice of (and still photos), inhabits this film like the energetic spirit desperate to bring some life to it. But the male protagonists are preoccupied and distant. The online erotic content is done so well, on both sides - the vacant stares are a better commentary than anything written could be. No one gets anywhere; all the female characters are trapped in stasis, and this ends up being truly depressing; a film where the sadness is infused throughout, rather than central to anything that 'happens'. On to <i>Drinking Buddies</i> next.<br /><br />30 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Drinking Buddies<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I've seen three films by Swanberg and they've run the gamut from no-budget amateurism (<i>LOL</i>) to this, which is as professional as any other indie film (with <i>Alexander the Last</i> positioned perfectly in between, at least in terms of production values). And my lukewarm reception (or given the lead character's name, Luke-warm, ha ha) to this made me realise how much the style of the first two films made me enjoy them more. Without the very bare artifice of consumer DV, <i>Drinking Buddies</i> felt much more conventional than I would have liked. Of course, the polish and shine here is every bit as artificial, even more so, but the baseline for how a film is 'supposed' to be made has conditioned me, after 30 years of seeing films, to see clean edits, crisp sound and in-focus framing as so normal that I forget it's even a film. So there's an interesting meta- level, but what about <i>Drinking Buddies</i> itself? The title made me think this would be an exploration of alcoholism and dependency like <i>Smashed</i> was, but instead it was a romantic drama where alcohol played a role - but Swanberg was non-judgemental in his behaviour. This is the first time I've ever actually noticed Olivia Wilde in anything, or rather, she shines with a flamboyant personality and serious acting chops, though I don't know I should expect that from <i>Burt Wonderstone. </i>This leaves 'mumblecore' as far behind in the rear-view as the Duplass brothers have, but again, without that artifice I found myself disinterested. I'm not a fan of will-they-won't-they stories (though I guess <i>Alexander the Last</i> also had that) and I'm also not crazy about the girl from <i>Up in the Air</i>. But like that film, this doesn't try to give the audience some satisfying payoff of resolution. It seems that all three of the Swanberg films I've seen (and maybe others from this 'scene', though I have to think about it more) reject any traditional character growth or epiphanies, instead suggesting an unending reality of people making the same mistakes and avoiding their problems. This is pretty goddam pessimistic, but probably quite close to my view of human interaction in 2013. I saw Chris Swanson was the music supervisor and the soundtrack was (I assume) recent Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar stuff, none of which I recognised except for when the first song from Richard Youngs' <i>Sapphie </i>comes in at a crucial moment, and there's a great example of music choice pushing my own buttons - it seemed like the most emotional moment in the whole movie, but that's of course because I drew an association via that song to my own life.<br /><br />31 August 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Brown&#x27;s Requiem<br />Jason Freeland, USA , 1998<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I took a break from a coding marathon to indulge in this completely forgotten film, an adaptation of James Ellroy's first novel starring Michael Rooker and featuring a young Selma Blair, Kevin Corrigan, and the guy who played Curly in the recent <i>Three Stooges</i> film. I haven't read the novel but if the screenplay adapted the dialogue straight, then Ellroy sure developed a lot between this and <i>American Tabloid</i>. There's no sense of a detective story being deconstructed here, as director Jason Freeland seemed to be paying tribute to films like <i>Chinatown</i>. I suspect this was financed in an attempt to capitalise on <i>LA Confidential</i>'s success, but instead of setting it as a period piece (even the early 80s, when the book was written, might have been nice), <i>Brown's Requiem</i> takes place in late 90s LA, an LA still inhabited by scumbags and lowlifes, but a visually unimpressive one for sure. Rooker is awesome and does what he can with the script, which merges a brilliant plot with terrible dialogue and sticks an awkward voiceover narration throughout, maybe as an attempt to make things more coherent. Some of the twists are so choreographed that they almost feel insulting, but I admit that I was engaged with the plot enough despite the B-movie execution and overindulgence of clichés.<br /><br />02 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Magic Magic<br />Sebasti&#xE1;n Silva, Chile / USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I really enjoyed this, and it kept me unsure about what it was going to be throughout the entire thing. I think this has been overshadowed by the other film that Silva shot with Cera, which I look forward to when it comes out on video. Cera's played against type a few times now but this is the first performance of his where he has no remaining traces of George MIchael. Juno Temple's crazy act is gripping, and the climax was a genuine surprise to me and rather beautiful in its execution. There's so many overtones of conventional horror/thriller films, but it never commits to any and left me genuine unsure where things were gonna go.<br /><br />04 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Rapture-Palooza<br />Paul Middleditch, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />For a terrible comedy, this was an OK premise - reminding me of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's <i>Good Omens</i>. By casting Robinson as the embodiment of pure evil, it allowed the filmmakers to cram as many horrible sexist dick/vagina jokes into this film as possible without looking like they were endorsing said attitudes. It's a copout and admittedly Robinson delivers the sleaze well, but all of the clever bits were in the depictions of post-Rapture Seattle (with pothead wraiths, and potty-mouthed crows) and not in the characterisations, which were thin and dull. I'm not crazy about Anna Kendrick and she can't really carry a film by herself, but the bit roles of Tom Lennon, Paul Scheer, and Rob Huebel made this slightly better than reprehensible. Huebel was actually pretty great, and while this seemed to reinforce Christianity at the beginning, it resolved in a nonsensical manner. But I'm grasping for compliments. It served as OK fodder while cleaning the office which is I guess the best that one can say about something like this.<br /><br />04 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Crystal Fairy<br />Sebasti&#xE1;n Silva, Chile , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Shot on the side just for fun while making <i>Magic Magic</i>, <i>Crystal Fairy and the Magical Cactus and 2012</i> transcends the first film by being something more simple and loose. Having watched Cera turn heel three times in a row now (if you count <i>This is the End</i>), his character here is by far the most nuanced and sympathetic of them. But it's Gaby Hoffmann's Crystal Fairy who is totally fucking astounding. For the first half I just thought this was easy comedy - her character is mostly cliché, though I have met many people exactly like her - and the odd-couple dynamic with Cera was fun, because it never pushed things too far and the Chilean brothers worked as fantastic ballast. But when they get to the beach it enters a far more complex emotional area and these passing relationships are brought to a full study, yet one that just sketches and leaves the rest up to the viewer. The drug trip is done realistically too, without resorting to cheap effects or comedy. This film is a comedy, I think, though about details rather than ha-ha moments. Crystal Fairy's climactic revelation around the campfire is the one mis-step, as it seems to make things all come together a bit much a clean epiphany; her telling the American researcher her real name was actually far more powerful, and the film could have just ended there. Still, there's something really great about this, and maybe it's just because of how realistic the two American characters seemed and the filmmaker's wisdom in (mostly) leaving things be.<br /><br />09 September 2013<br />Disconnect<br />Henry Alex Rubin, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I am struggling to think of one word to sum this up and I keep coming back to 'turd'. It's been over a decade since I've seen Daron, but I kept thinking about how much more fun this would be to watch with him. I guess this film really had a lot to say about cyberbullying and identity theft, and I should have paid closer attention to it so I don't make similar mistakes. This is some sort of cautionary tale about how we use digital representations of the self, or how they use us, written with a subtle moralising and an "aren't I clever?" way of connecting three separate stories. Jason Bateman is top-billed and I kept wondering why though he became more prominent in the last third of the film. He's phoning it in, for the most part, and even though he's such a sympathetic actor I have to seriously question him choice in taking this role. After recently watching Swanberg's <i>LOL</i>, even though it's a 100% different film, I can't help but think how successful that was at illustrating our changing values about intimacy w/r/t social media. Or maybe I only say that cause I liked that film and I hated this one and I like making easy comparisons.<br /><br />09 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Coffee Town<br />Brad Copeland, USA , 2013<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />A comedy about coffee starring Glenn Howerton, Steve Little and Ben Schwartz? Sign me up! Except why did I expect this to be good?  I should have known when the first image was "A film by College Humour.com". My enjoyment of these actors was tempered by the utterly mediocre script and dependence on cheap gay jokes (doing that thing all comedies do now where they masquerade homophobic jokes as an empty critique of homophobia) and mocking Downs Syndrome (which also does the same thing - tries to empower the character somewhat, but he still has fucking Downs Syndrome and isn't in the film for any other reason). I did laugh more than I'm admitting - Steve Little's character is stupid to the point of insanity, and Ben Schwartz takes the Dennis Reynolds sociopath/rapist vive and crosses it with a nice dose of Jean-Ralphio. This leaves little for Howerton to do except play the straight man, and while he has a witty delivery, a Dennis without the D.E.N.N.I.S. system isn't much of a Dennis, if you get my drift.  Josh Groban was pretty great in this.<br /><br />10 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Bad Milo<br />Jacob Vaughan, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br /><i>Bad Milo</i> was pretty all-right. I wonder why it took so long for Ken Marino to get a starring role - he was the hunkiest and most affable member of <i>The State</i> and the one that seemed most poised for breakout, but I guess the lucky winner was, hmmm, Michael Ian Black? Anyway, yet another horror comedy and I almost didn't want to watch it but the running time was short and I was sleepy and had no stamina for anything longer or more serious - and while far from 'serious', this was way more on the side of horror than comedy, though not scary at all, and when it tried to be funny it was in a way that was almost gentle. It was a good move not to make this a gross-out film - the concept is gross enough, but the ass entry/exit was shot as tastefully as possible and the humour avoided the easy path of scatology. This wasn't a masterpiece and the psychology was thin, but ever since he appeared in <i>Tim &amp; Eric</i> I've just adored Erik Charles Nielsen, and it was also nice to see the guy from <i>Baghead</i> get to star in something that used nice lenses.<br /><br />12 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Silver Bullets<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This is a tricky one; it shifted gears so suddenly, or at least I thought so. By the time it was over I wasn't sure what I had just watched. Swanberg continues to impress me; all four of his films deal with the issue of performative sexuality within oneself, in different ways. Like <i>Alexander the Last</i> this is concerned with the nature of acting and creation, and the intimacy that develops through these acts. Swanberg's character delivers a speech about how he doesn't actually want to make films but doesn't know what else to do, and his prolific output suggests this may not be fiction; at the end, when the relationship is examined in a post-mortem we're asked if it was worth it because of the film-product that comes out. So much of this film required me to be attuned to a different frequency than I'm used to, and I found myself questioning the formal construction at points. For all of the talk of low-budget/mumblecore being the root of Swanberg's ethos, I've seen now (in four different films) an artist with an incredibly unique approach to the visual elements of cinema. There were scenes that emphasised background objects such as lamps in the most intensely bizarre ways, all overly focused, ghoulishly lit and foregrounded obtusely. And the actors, always the hallmark of a Swanberg film, gave it all and often seemed to be ignored. That this is a film about making a horror/B-movie must be relevant; that genre's approach to camera angles and lighting was applied to very different subject matter, and it's crazy how other-worldly it felt at times. Though the music was often overbearing, this was maybe the best thing I've seen yet by this director - and certainly the most formally distinctive of the whole 'mumblecore' movement (which I hate lumping together, but you know what I mean).<br /><br />16 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Impolex<br />Alex Ross Perry, USA , 2009<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Wow, a sorta-adaptation of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>? How did I not know about this sooner? I guess because it's terrible, but that's no excuse. It was a good thing to watch on the eve of the release of Pynchon's new book, I suppose, even if it was a chore to get through. Where do I begin? I'm glad that if someone is going to tackle <i>GR</i>, they would do it in a manner that is fragmented and only loosely based on the novel - you'd be a fool to attempt the entire scope of the book. But this ended up feeling more like a loose, absurdist sketch trying to namedrop as many references to the novel as is possible. I don't mind the no-budget bullshit look - have a bunch of kids run around in the forest and make a film for nothing, I'm okay with that. I didn't mind the Slothrop character, who talked in a Norm McDonald impersonation throughout and was vaguely likeable. Eugene Mirman as the voice of the octopus was pretty underwhelming, and this failed to even be engaging as a bit of absurdity. Hey look, there's a banana, and you've mentioned <i>The White Visitation</i>. This does not a good film make; the attempts to draw some emotional connection out of Slothrop and Katje culminates in a long Molly Bloom-style soliloquy by Sheil which fails to be moving as it bears little relation to the rest of the film. This feels like something I would have made in college with my friends, down to the production values, except I would have spelled Imipolex correctly.<br /><br />20 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    All Is Bright<br />Phil Morrison, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />The premise sounded great and there could have been a fun, funny film based around the idea of Pauls Rudd and Giamatti selling Christmas trees in New York. But this was marred by its insistence on injecting heartwarming moments throughout, and slight trespassing into many questionable areas (a chronicle of down-and-out economic woes, buddy comedy, a bad remake of <i>Straight Time</i>, and it is actually a Christmas film which I somehow didn't realise when I read the blurb about it). One or two genuine chuckles here, but for the most part it was horrible. I am totally selling low on the Paul Giamatti dramedy these days.<br /><br />21 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Touchy Feely<br />Lynn Shelton, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Lynn Shelton finally missteps here. I appreciate what she was trying to do - there's a lot of difficult balancing here, as this film is about intimacy, healing and what can't be spoken or seen. Josh Pais is a great comic character actor and I always enjoy him when he turns up in various things, and when he's called on for humour, he's great - the scene of him going to receive Reiki the first time is absolutely hilarious. But his character is fairly one-note, as he plays the repressed, awkward man with an unarticulated tragedy/trauma in his past so straight that even the glimpses of epiphany that he experiences feel unnatural. Rosemary DeWitt excels, as she's a great actress, but I just couldn't make myself like this. Though at least for a film that concerns itself so much with new age lies such as Reiki, it doesn't endorse those practices and thus I could still try to enjoy the film. Ellen Page is cast in a character so much younger than she actually is, that I found it unconvincing, and I had to suffer through a performance of a shitty indie-folk song that I couldn't tell if it was meant to be meaningful or not. If this was the first film I saw by Shelton I would never, ever, go back to check out her earlier films, which are great. As I felt with <i>Drinking Buddies</i>, when this wave of low-budget American filmmakers gets more established technically and financially, the results usually skew towards middle-of-the-road (the Duplass brothers being an exception).<br /><br />22 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Quiet City<br />Aaron Katz, USA , 2007<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Another gentle film with no real drama or plot - this time, a woman visiting a friend in New York ends up spending the weekend with an aimless guy, non-romantically, as they have dull conversations and go to a party. I've been really watching a run of these lately, mostly because they're usually under 90 minutes, and I figured I'd check out what Aaron Katz was all about. The lack of a compelling story left me unengaged, wondering a bit why I was bothering, as this lacked the visual mood experimentation of Swanberg's work or Bujalski's subtle mastery. Maybe I was looking too hard and the pleasures of <i>Quiet City</i> were given away by the title - Katz attempts to film a New York City that is between the commotion, with shots lingering endlessly on sun and sunset, skies, and other natural occurrences. This isn't a bad film by any means, but it's hard to recommend this for any reason. I maybe was just as floating in my mid-20s, but I spent the majority of them in the UK so the experiences of all of these characters in all of these films feel strangely familiar, yet uncanny.<br /><br />23 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Invisible Adversaries<br />Valie Export, Austria , 1977<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Wow, what an amazing film. I haven't seen it since '99 but have long considered it an influence, though in recent years that was based more on vague recollection than actual content. Export's film is really unlike anything else, and it attempts so many things that it would be easy to call it 'overreaching' if I criticised films that way, but I delight in ambition and this does things in a manner that is so pure 'art film' it can be taken as a pure experiment in style if nothing else. The alien invasion theme is so minor, really only being a presence rather than a plot point, and it serves as a backdrop to explore so many other themes: the body, intimacy, a woman's sense of self, alienation, changing urban environments, a criticism of Second Republic Austria, etc. Apart from some overly long scenes about parking tickets that I didn't understand the purpose of, the other set pieces are engaging. Occasionally visually thrilling (mirrors transform this into something truly uncanny; the ice-skating sequence is stunning); oddly erotic (though the intimacy here, while realistic, is really most striking in contrast to the troubled aspects of their relationship); the bits that feel like leftover performance art (running around the fountain in Vienna with cardboard cutouts; the bodies on the street next to the tram; the posed photographs-as-classic paintings) take on many possibilities in the context of these themes. There's a very sad core to this, as it really is about a relationship that fails; the elaborately staged banal arguments about watering the flowers get tedious, but have a realism that's deeper than the arguments in <i>Le Mépris</i> or especially <i>Possession</i>, even moreso when juxtaposed against the general fantasy/weirdness of the rest of this film. As a 'feminist film' (a vague term, sure, but given Export's pedigree and the themes at play here, that's not a stretch) this is unparalleled; as a film in general, it's pretty fucking magnificent.<br /><br />28 September 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Cockfighter<br />Monte Hellman, USA , 1974<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I love Warren Oates but this was a film where he was silent throughout, playing a man who decided not to speak until he won the cockfighter of the year contest. As a vegetarian with animal rights sympathies, the actual fights in this film were absolutely brutal to watch, though photographed well. You know there were no special effects, no disclaimers about "no actual animals were harmed in the production of this film" - the SPCA even appears in a minor plot point. The film itself is classic 70's atmosphere, a Roger Corman production that just rolls along without any real climax of development. Oates's body language is so exaggerated as he tries to communicate without speaking, and it's all for what? It's a great performance anyway even if I wondered at times why I was watching - I guess the portrait of the Southern cockfighting scene was fascinating if nothing else.<br /><br />02 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Post Tenebras Lux<br />Carlos Reygadas, Mexico / France / Netherlands / Germany , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>Post Tenebras Lux</i> is among the most striking works of contemporary cinema in recent years, and I'd rank it alongside <i>Upstream Color</i> with the best films I've seen this year. It's not a film I can recommend for everyone, and my engagement with it admittedly followed an ebb and flow: the opening sequences, with the child in the dark and the animals up through the first appearance of the glowing red demon, were so spellbinding that I gave myself completely to them. As the 'story' started to unfold, I found myself struggling to piece things together, and only when I gave in and took this as something to experience rather than interpret did I again feel the power. Additionally, the strange optical distortion on the outdoor scenes made me think that perhaps I was supposed to be wearing 3D glasses for those shots; in the end, I came to take this as an odd touch that's inseparable from this film's visual splendour (as well as the non-widescreen aspect ratio). There's certainly lots of biography here, and this can be taken as a meditation on family, desire and time. What seems like fantasy or non-sequitur someone emotes something that builds up to create a mood; still, the rugby game at the end is completely impossible to explain in any context. Maybe trying to invoke such a reading feels like a misstep, but then I don't want to be uncritical just because I am dazzled by spooky ambience and incredible (yet not baroque) imagery. But this affected me, immensely, and I'll watch it many more times, I suspect.<br /><br />02 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Mud<br />Jeff Nichols, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I ultimately found <i>Mud</i> to be an extremely satisfying work of entertainment. It was smart enough to avoid clichés, though ultimately concludes in a standard manner. I just really really enjoy Matthew McConaughey, even though his character here was pretty bland. The writers attempted to draw more complexity around him, but he can't be any more than a bad seed whose weakness is women. While this structure would typically cause me to yawn, I somehow sat through <i>Mud</i> in a state of pure entertainment. The kid actors are pretty good, and the opening scenes of this film are clearly influenced by the same adventurous wonder that so many of the films I grew up with had (<i>The Goonies, The Explorers</i>).  It's essentially a feel-good family film, which proclaims the strength of family relations over romantic ones - the pessimism towards traditional Hollywood "true love" plots is perhaps its one bold stance. Plus, Joe Don Baker, barely recognisable at this stage in his life!<br /><br />05 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Happiness<br />Todd Solondz, USA , 1998<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I was the last person in the world who never saw this; not for any reason, I just never got around to it. Solondz makes films in a manner that makes it hard for me to enjoy them; everything is bathed in irony, particularly the sets and the costumes, and the intentionally wooden yet earnest performances leave me feeling distant. But maybe that's the point? I liked the way this juxtaposes truly dark humour with heavy drama; the scene where the paedophile is confessing to his son dances on a line of good taste, and its genuinely exciting for it. But as a chronicle of human misery, it takes broad swings and avoids dealing with anything in a constructive manner. I think there's more insight into the misery of the human condition in a single throwaway joke on <i>Louie</i> than in this entire film's too-long 134 minutes. But this was 1998, where such vulnerability was more taboo, and thus Solondz cloak of irony feels of-its-time, and I can forgive this. Of course, the paedo's wife is the most truly tragic character here, repeatedly convincing herself that she is an exciting, successful person when she's probably the most hopeless of them all. More Ben Gazzara would have been nice, but that's true in all films. I will watch the sequel soon.<br /><br />06 October 2013<br />Le temps du loup<br />Michael Haneke, France / Austria / Germany , 2003<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I should have written about this when I did my master's dissertation, as it's about a disaster/apocalypse where the actual reason for the crisis is never articulated. Haneke chooses to focus on the rural side of post-apocalyptic narrative, and on the small-scale family setting. This wasn't as much fun as it sounded like it would be, being a series of drawn-out vignettes about the friendship between the daughter and a local boy, and the power struggles of the settlers. Power is really what I took the most here - it's a film about how people organise themselves, and how they trust and fear each other. There wasn't as much improvisation or exploration of how privilege makes one complacent as I expected, which is not a bad thing; still, I found myself impatient as the end approached. Knowing that there would be no hope or resolution, I just wanted it to be over.<br /><br />07 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Freeloaders<br />Dan Rosen, USA , 2012<br />Location: M/S Mariella cabin 2056<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />Shitty. Is there any worse presence in contemporary comedy than Broken Lizard? They made one funny film (<i>Super Troopers</i>), which isn't even anything special but came at a time when the mainstream comedyscape was slim pickings (pre-Apatow, pre-McKay/Ferrell). Their sequels have all been boring, as they aren't funny enough to sustain a film on writing and performance alone, and they are strangely conservative when it comes to the raunchy humour. <i>Freeloaders </i>follows from this, occupying perhaps an even more odd nether-zone of comedy. The Broken Lizard guys outsourced this one, only appearing in cameos, and built the film around no-name comedy actors (playing boring archetypes: the nice everyman guy, the flamboyant black man, the slutty party girl, the wild card) and the presence of Adam Duritz from Counting Crows, who not only plays himself but executive produced this odd, odd vanity trip. The only funny parts were Dave Foley playing himself (and really truly playing himself, if you've ever listened to him talk about his brutal divorce on <i>WTF</i>) and even that was a stretch.<br /><br />07 October 2013<br />Paris, Texas<br />Wim Wenders, \nWest Germany / \nFrance / \nUK , 1984<br />Location: M/S Mariella<br />Format: digital file on laptop<br />I never saw this before. Actually, I don't think I've ever seen anything by Wim Wenders. My first girlfriend was from Paris, Texas which makes this one of the few places in America I've actually visited. The film, however, never ventures into Paris, but jumps between south Texas and LA over a long, yet satisfying 145 minutes. The first act of this is slow, gritty big-sky noir, with Stockwell and HDS in proper 'road movie' form. It changes quite abruptly, unfolding with increasing emotional depth, never shocking, and never going off the rails. All of the characters in this film behave rationally; there's no point that anything really upsetting happens; there's not really any conflict at all. The big buildup is to the strange conversations between Kinski and Stanton, and it's as masterful a dramatic scene as you'll ever see. I've passed up the soundtrack to this a million times, but if I'm ever at Jerry's again I'll grab it, for Ry Cooder does well. The road movie part sounds just like the theme music to <i>Breaking Bad</i> and as the film opens up its human core, the guitar slides follow into something beautiful and blossoming.  I really want to see that documentary about HDS now; it just played in the Helsinki festival but I missed it.<br /><br />14 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Zero Charisma<br />Katie Graham, Andrew Matthews, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Nerdist made this film and I wanted something light, and it worked; I actually liked this way more than I expected. It's not high drama, nor is it sophisticated; yet it's not superficial either, and if Nerdist are planning to work exclusively in films that explore nerd culture, they've made a good start. The frustration and pain that someone might experience in this lifestyle is portrayed well, though it does tend to exaggerate the 'cool hipster' vs nerd stereotypes; but that's probably the point. The lead actor, Sam Eidson, is actually fantastic and delivers something above and beyond the script. This is a fairly one-dimensional premise, with fairly one-dimensional acting (outside of Eidson), but it somehow feels more multifaceted than it should be. It's not really a comedy, either - funny in a few points, trying to be in a few others - and it doesn't try to get easy laughs by making fun of these guys for being awkward with women, etc. Eidson manages to wrap a lot into his performance, even if the backstory is already prepared by popular culture, etc.<br /><br />18 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Computer Chess<br />Andrew Bujalski, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>Computer Chess </i>is really unlike anything I've ever seen. It's a very, very weird film - the concept, the style, and the execution all suggest a decision-making process unlike any film contemporaries. Bujalski isn't overly meticulous, nor he is visceral like David Lynch, but it's not sloppy either. I read a lot about this before seeing it (which didn't influence my enjoyment, I don't think) and thought this sounded like a total departure from his first few films. Upon actually seeing it, I felt a lot of continuing themes and similar stylistic choices, despite shooting this with vintage equipment and basing it around such a bizarre premise. For a film about computers playing chess, belief is a major theme, and it almost seems like Bujalski is playing God here, populating this hotel with an entire society of archetypes and residents. <i>Computer Chess</i> would shift at times from moments of almost lucid surrealism (particularly the colour sequence) to grounded, thoughtful meditations, and while it's a film built around technology as a concept, it has relatively little overt commentary to offer on our present-day existence. My biggest criticism would lie in the acting; especially after the great performances in <i>Beeswax, </i>Bujalski seems to be letting that slip somewhat - the Papageorge character is exaggerated and mysterious, and Peter, closest thing to a protagonist this film has, is almost too dry and distant. I suspect on future watchings I'll pick up on more. I think Bujalski is really trying to find a radical new form of expression in cinema, and has been since his first film - and as <i>Computer Chess</i> is his most experimental venture yet, it's daring makes this more apparent than the character driven dramas of <i>Mutual Appreciation</i>, <i>Funny Ha Ha</i> and <i>Beeswax. </i>I read something arguing the opposite - that those films were at times bored with their own scripts, and Bujalski was just using the whole 'mumblecore' setting as a canvas to explore the visual element. Here, this is more apparent, with the 4:3 framing and strict limitations of the equipment, and the bizarro concept as well.<br /><br />22 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Harlan County U.S.A.<br />Barbara Kopple, USA , 1976<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I wasn't surprised to find <i>Harlan County, USA</i> so engrossing - it usually ranks high on lists of the best documentary films ever made. What I found surprising was how emotionally invested I became watching it, moved to tears at points. Kopple's construction can probably raise all sorts of questions about propaganda and viewpoint, but I'm happy to throw those concerns out the window and just bask in the glory of a masterpiece. This is all 16mm and archival footage, but it comes together in an incredibly humanistic way. The faces, oh the faces! Her camera zooms in on Eastern Kentucky's most weathered, emotive and complex visages, and let's 'face' it, these aren't attractive people - revealing a power accentuated by the sheer force of their conviction. There's just enough of this to keep the historical content from overwhelming the film, though we learn few names - the solidarity is the point. The Joseph Yablonski murder is covered well, with great archival footage, reminding me of this dark period in my region's own past. Kopple spends almost as much time focusing on the wives and women of Harlan County, and their role in the strike, as on the workers themselves, which may be due to the mostly female production team, and that's great. That the strike ends, only to have the union leaders vote away the right to strike a year later, is a punishing, crippling coda. It's easy to say the American labour is dead, but this is a crucial insight into its final gasps. The sad, pathetic state of American labour today just makes me depressed. The people in this film fight together for their own benefit, their actual lives - and they come together in true solidarity, before their lifestyles have been chipped away at by decades of vapid pop culture and consumerism. My own life is so fucking worthless; nothing I do matters, nothing any of us do is meaningful. I would say the contrast between <i>Harlan County</i> and my own sheltered happy European artist life would make me give up hope, except that I already lost it a long time ago.<br /><br />27 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Kings of Summer<br />Jordan Vogt-Roberts, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />My brother recommended this, and I was delighted by it. What sounded like a typical coming-of-age story on paper was realised as a true crowd-pleaser, blending the wide-eyed wonder of <i>Goonies</i> with contemporary cinematography, a little bit of twee aesthetics, and a genuinely funny script. Despite the feelgood nature, it never panders; the stakes are light, but it's not fluff; the kids are heroes, but also there's never any doubt that they are misguided, because their parents are actually pretty OK as parents go. At times it felt like it played things slightly too much for laughs, as if there could be no mistaking this for anything but a comedy, but since the humour was actually solid (not mean, racist, homophobic or formulaic) I didn't mind. Using some of the most welcome faces in contemporary comedy helped too - there's not an actor here who I don't enjoy (Rajskub, Middleditch, Tony Hale, Mullally...). Biaggio is the new McLovin', a character who was written sympathetically but genuinely weird, and the two lead kids give beautiful, understated performances. If this had been made 6-7 years ago, it would have starred Cera and/or Eisenberg, and I'm glad that it wasn't. Offerman killed it, managing to stick to his type while injecting a massive amount of misery and bitterness. Kumail also excelled in his cameo ("My American name is Gary") and the overall construction of this was more or less perfect. I would have enjoyed more Hannibal Burress but that's always true.<br /><br />30 October 2013<br />Casino<br />Martin Scorsese, USA / France , 1995<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I'm not really sure why I watched this. I think <i>Goodfellas</i> is probably the most overrated film of all time, and this was like a second-rate version of it. Why the fuck did this need to be almost three hours long? I wish the entire DeNiro/Sharon Stone marriage plot had been excised, and then maybe this would have been more enjoyable. Instead it was just the cliché of what I imagine Scorcese films to be like (since I haven't actually seen that many). DeNiro is still credible at this point but everything seemed so predictable that I was pretty exhausted by the end, had no surprises, and the plot wasn't even very interesting. The best thing going for this was the late 70s/early 80s setting, with great cars, clothes and interior design. I'm not interested in the myth of Vegas in the slightest, nor does mob violence do much for me, so I can just chalk this up to a learning experience (to not bother). I've still never seen <i>Mean Streets</i> but it's hard to raise the interest in it; how could this be so bad but <i>King of Comedy</i> and <i>After Hours</i> be so good?<br /><br />30 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Way Way Back<br />Nat Faxon, Jim Rash, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Nat Faxon and Jim "Dean Pelton" Rash had a critical hit on their hands with their screenplay for <i>The Descendants </i>(not about the SST band) and followed it up with this, where they direct (and act) as well. That style of "NPR movie" is in full effect - or maybe a better term would be 'white people movie', since the thought of a black person watching this is hilarious to me. I actually see a lot of films from this genre - they are eminently watchable, smarter than most of what American film offers, but so safe and middlebrow that it's actually agitating. This is a coming-of-age film, which makes it even easier to push those buttons, and I think it paled in comparison to <i>Kings of Summer</i>, though both were about escape and both had a strict summer setting. The difference is that <i>Kings of Summer</i> was actually very funny, and this was more melancholy. When Sam Rockwell just goes off, it's uplifting, though this pales compared to his performance in <i>Seven Psychopaths</i>; Steve Carrell is nice to see as a nasty, unlikeable character for once, and Toni Colette is a great actress in any situation. But <i>The Way Way Back</i> is just too easy, using the accessible realm of teen awkwardness as an easy pathway to false profundity. Every scene is drenched in the nostalgia of a collective consciousness (at least if you're a middle class white American in your thirties); only an iPod reveals this as being set in contemporary times, otherwise it could be 1982. My criticism is really because I want more from film - I want art that provokes, screams and bursts from the frame. <i>The Way Way Back</i> has such a pleasant vibe that it's occasionally very false; there were bits of dialogue that I found hard to imagine anyone as intelligent as Jim Rash writing without being aware of its pandering nature. But a film is an entertainment product after all, and they know exactly how to construct within the constraints of the genre. Sometimes "NPR films" can reach a bit further, transcending the trappings of the genre and creating something actually quite magical. (I guess Hal Hartley's <i>Simple Men</i>, a film I really truly love, would class into this genre today.) I really like Jim Rash and I haven't lost any respect for him because he made this, but it's nothing more than mediocrity dressed in fancy garments.<br /><br />31 October 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Dealin&#x27; with Idiots<br />Jeff Garlin, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Jeff Garlin made this simple film that is a mostly plotless, roaming series of character sketches, featuring lots of comedy goods and no actual tension. I really enjoyed this, because I didn't expect much; Garlin is so likeable, and it's actually funny; long parts of this are just Odenkirk, Willard and Smoove doing what they do best, and the little league story is a nice, easy backdrop to hang these improvisations on. As pet projects go, I wish there were more like this.<br /><br />03 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Los Angeles Plays Itself<br />Thom Andersen, USA , 2003<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Thom Andersen's essay film does everything I'd want from such a film - it clearly communicates a viewpoint, which is personal and strange, while letting images do the majority of illustration. I've never been to Los Angeles (I use the full name here, instead of 'LA', which he finds perjorative) and I've read so much of the literature about it now that it feels strange to only know it as a series of images. But that suits the nature of <i>Los Angeles Plays Itself</i>, which seeks to correct the vision of the city as portrayed by cinema. The number of films he excerpts here is staggering, some high art and some incredibly not (Stallone's <i>Cobra</i> has a great role here, as an example of impossible geography, which I hate to inform Mr. Andersen is not just something that happens to Los Angeles). Formally, it's a bit like <i>Room 237</i>, but with a unified voice and much larger scope. Despite Andersen's criticisms, his love of cinema bleeds through. He seems to highlight <i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, and <i>LA Confidential</i> as the definitive Los Angeles films of the 70s, 80s and 90s respectively. His frustration with all of these films (<i>Chinatown</i> is an example of myth-making and historical inaccuracy through the way it portrays the history of the aqueduct; <i>LA Confidential</i> is excoriated for the same thing w/r/t the police corruption in the 1950s, but also for the way it uses Neutra's Lowell Health House to symbolise decadence) is clear, but there's also some admiration, and grudging admissions of, for example, Curtis Hanson agreeing with him. Andersen has a great eye for architecture and his overall argument - that the modernist architecture of Los Angeles should be celebrated, not villianised -- is sound. But I can't help thinking that the values system of the entertainment industry is to blame for these decisions; the films itself are just a scapegoat. The last section of the film looks at Charles Burnett and other African-American neorealist filmmakers who depict a side of Los Angeles never seen in Hollywood, and it makes a compelling case for a pluralistic vision - and an uplifting note to end on (even if the films themselves do not seem particularly uplifting). At 170 minutes, <i>Los Angeles Plays Itself</i> is a long exercise, and perhaps the monotone narration will lull some to sleep. I found it riveting - honestly, I could have gone on for another hour - which probably speaks to my tastes. Supposedly a legitimate release (with HD upgrades) will happen soon, as rights prevented this from ever getting released "for real" (though it seems to me like it would fall perfectly under "fair use").<br /><br />06 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Frances Ha<br />Noah Baumbach, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I like all of Baumbach's films in some way, with some more than others, and thus was really anticipating this being great. And it was extremely enjoyable, but much lighter fare than I expected. The presence of Adam Driver, Brooklyn, and a plot around a confused, drifting 27 year old makes this feel like an arthouse version of <i>Girls</i>, which is fine. It was actually funny, but not overwhelmingly so; the six years of distance I have between these characters is enough to make this bittersweet without being mocking (moreso than <i>Girls</i>) and despite the presence of Gerwig, this doesn't feel like a grown-up Joe Swanberg or Andrew Bujalski film. Instead, it's not a million miles away from the last Baumbach/Gerwig pairing, except it deals with the issue of ageing from the other side. It's nice that a film can be based around female characters without making dating or relationships central (but without explicitly denying them). Gerwig is great in this, I guess; she does what she does so well that it makes me wonder about her range. As she wrote the screenplay, I'm sure the material is close to hear heart, yet it's not hard to imagine Zooey Deschanel or some such interchangeable twee actress stepping into the role transparently. I think she'll be a much more interesting actress in ten years, if she's still around. The sequence where she goes home to Sacramento for holidays with her family is by far the most dazzling part of this film, edited to allow no scene to last more than a few seconds and capturing something that is simultaneously familiar and sad; maybe it's even better when juxtaposed with the immediate subsequent decline back in New York. The style of the film is such a nod to the classics that it almost feels generic, but that Sacramento portion is just so stunning (and featuring the real Gerwig parents) that I think it made the whole experience for me.<br /><br />07 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Pictures of Superheroes<br />Don Swaynos, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Being a somewhat odd/lost day, I decided to be lazy and watch an absurd comedy. Absurd this was, occupying the same slow, anything-goes nonsensical universe that <i>Somebody Up There Likes Me</i> and <i>Wrong</i> exist it. I liked this better than either of those, because it became about the attitude and not so much about the jokes, which occasionally reached, but generally were successful. It adds up to nothing, but that's the lesson here. This could feel dark and cynical, but it was so funny (to me) that it actually picked up my spirits if anything.<br /><br />07 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Road Movie<br />Joseph Strick, USA , 1974<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />If you like long, almost pornographic shots of rust belt industrial scenery, or small Ohio town (I do, I do!) then there will be a lot to enjoy in <i>Road Movie</i>. An odd B-movie, this is about a hooker who hangs around with two independent truckers. The screenplay was adapted by a female writer and so i thought we might get a somewhat feminist take on prostitution, but nope - this is ugly, brutal and embodies the essence of the sleazy 70s. At least she isn't a hooker with a heart of gold - instead, she's a hooker with extreme problems, and her fucked-up relationship with these truckers doesn't help. Some topics, such as truck driver unionisation issues, are delved into, but there's little to take away from this, a film that is almost plotless and certainly lacking any traditional dramatic structure. Watching this feels a bit like being stuck out on Route 19 somewhere for 90 minutes. Loved it.<br /><br />08 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The World&#x27;s End<br />Edgar Wright, UK , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />The most enjoyable of the Pegg/Frost/Wright collaborations, this managed to push all of the right buttons apart from some pacing issues in the first act. The humour is quick, funny, and accessible without being too easy; the kinetic action sequences are the most dazzling of anything Wright's done. Nick Frost actually seems like a pretty good actor, and Pegg's stunted adult act almost wears thin but is saved by situating his heyday in early 90s UK culture (including a Sisters of Mercy tattoo) and by the film, once it becomes an action/adventure, doesn't need to dedicate any more time to the personal drama. The supporting cast was great, especially Paddy Considine. A lot of American comedies are trying to backslide into a more enlightened time by still employing homophobic and misogynist humour, just attributing it to "bad" characters which allows the jokes to stay in, but attempts to skirt around the ethics. And admittedly, I laugh sometimes at it. What I really liked here was that Pegg's character tries this with his friends early on, and not only do they all get pissed off at him, but the jokes aren't even funny, so Pegg and Wright aren't trying to have it both ways.<br /><br />09 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Ideology<br />Sophie Fiennes, UK / Ireland , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Has it really been this long since the first one? This time there's more of a focus on one topic, with the cinematic clips used to illustrate a point but not being about cinema itself. I think this is the best way to take Zizek - fun, creative, and quirky - but most importantly, it ties together his ideas about politics and culture with psychoanalysis, but not too much of the latter. It's not just about staying accessible, but having the right balance, because having read a lot of the guy's books, almost none of it has been worth the time since I'm not interested in pursuing Lacanian research. I was delighted by the choices here, particularly Frankenheimer's <i>Seconds</i> and <i>They Live</i>, not just because I love those films but because it actually provided a more coherent narrative. No <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>, though. I have been thinking a lot about the topic of ideology with regards to my experiences in Estonia, and while this was just a dilettante-level brushing of the surface, it made me think about larger issues in Western culture that I may have missed due to my semi-exile the past few years. I don't know if I'm going to follow this up with any "serious" reading on the topic but maybe I should.<br /><br />10 November 2013<br />Shaun of the Dead<br />Edgar Wright, \nUK / \nFrance , 2004<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />A lazy Sunday watch. I was nonplussed when I first saw this (so much that it apparently didn't even make it into my PBT) but I enjoyed it more the next time round though I still think it's the weakest of the Wright/Pegg collaborations. I forgot how actually decent the zombie action is, especially at the end, and the humour is enjoyable enough that I can forgive this for spawning a whole new era of zom-coms. Wright's kinetic style is actually subdued - <i>Spaced</i> had more visual experimentation, and <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> takes his fetish for artifice to its fullest and most realised potential - but there are still some great tracking shots, like the earlier scenes of Pegg walking around oblivious. I like how the Pegg/Frost dichotomy is flipped around somewhat in <i>The World's End</i> but it's also a much stronger film, emotionally graduated beyond the "slackers rule!" territory started in <i>Spaced</i> and with much better action sequences as well.<br /><br />13 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    We&#x27;re the Millers<br />Rawson Marshall Thurber, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Fiction can sometimes have the power to explore truth greater than nonfiction or documentary. <i>We're the Millers</i> is a subtle critique of American border policy, a well as an in-depth exploration of the socioeconomic status of Mexicans. Like <i>The Wire,</i> both sides of the law are portrayed without moral judgement, but this film goes further than the show did in capturing the day-to-day experiences of those in the nexus of the drug trade. And in a far shorter running time! Masquerading as a lighthearted comedy, director Rawson Marshall Thurber shows that he is clearly a descendent of great American humourist James Thurber -- and with the same ability to embed compassion, humility and pathos within a witty aside. Jason Sudekis is astounding, a breakout role for him, but he'll be passed over at Oscar time because he's so overshadowed by Jennifer Aniston's "tough stripper with brains" role - a satirical comment on such female archetypes, employing sexuality and a sharp tongue in an unholy alliance - a true <i>tour de force</i>. Though it doesn't get much screen time, I was blown away by Thurber's depiction of the Mexican drug village - a maquiladora of tranquility, showing how a fully functioning social experiment can exist amongst the political chaos of modern-day Mexico. On top of all of this we get a critique of the family structure - the existential loneliness of commitment, as exemplified by Offerman and Hahn's character, versus the fluid, postmodern dynamic of the faux-Millers. While humankind's inherent desire for structure is explored in a sophisticated manner, the ending brilliantly suggests the happiness can be found in the temporary - a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood reinforcement of family values. Overall, this is a subversive masterpiece - a true testament to what film can achieve, and a landmark accomplishment of the cinematic form.<br /><br />16 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    X-Men: The Last Stand<br />Brett Ratner, Canada / USA / UK , 2006<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Part of my<i> X-Men</i> weekend. I realised halfway through watching this that I had seen it before but never listed it here. I think I blocked out much of it, though it's not as mediocre as it could be. Thankfully, Cyclops gets killed off right away and while I liked the "she thinks it's the 1850s" aspect of the original comics Dark Phoenix saga, I understand that changes have to be made for Hollywood screenplay adaptation purposes. The makers of these films have to walk a fine line, trying to satisfy the obsessive fanboy types while also drawing in mass audiences, and I guess it works. The lame moral about tolerance dominates all of these films. What happened to Nightcrawler though? I'm surprised by how much I checked out of this once Patrick Stewart was gone, and while Jean Grey is probably the most interesting character in Marvel history, this film just makes her "really powerful". It feels like they could have stuck more obscure characters into the margins of these films if they had tried harder. I also think Halle Berry is a horrible actress, and she gives the audience no reason to care about her except that she is cool looking. Having just read the Marvel history, and realising how much my sympathies lie with Claremont's "the fight scenes are bullshit" attitude, this seemed to be far too much action and not even mutant hijinks. (Claremont does have a cameo in the opening scenes though).<br /><br />17 November 2013<br />X-Men: First Class<br />Matthew Vaughn, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I'm into the idea of a period piece <i>X-Men</i> film, and the alternate history of the Cuban missile crisis makes this have a playful, smirking edge underneath all the faux gravitas (a bit like <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>, maybe). This was probably the best of the whole series, though I barely remember the first two at this point. Michael Fassbender is far too good of an actor to deserve the atrocious dialogue he's saddled with; McAvoy plays Xavier as arrogant and smarmy, and I absolutely hated him throughout (but maybe I just don't like McAvoy). When I was 12 years old, Havok was my favourite X-Man because he seemed the most dark and tormented, and slightly obscure; Wolverine's dark and tormented nature was a bit too obvious, and the rest of dark and tormented characters all took a backseat to this X-Man who was probably the most powerful superhero of all, yet relegated to a backup role and constantly miserable over his fucked up relationship with Polaris. But in the film, Alex Summers is just a jock, slightly bullying, and not nearly as fleshed out as the young Hank McCoy (excellent) or young Mystique (not excellent, despite Jennifer Lawrence). It felt a bit like a wasted opportunity, but I guess you're already into X-Men revisionism when you only keep Beast from the true original lineup and put in new school characters like Mystique and have Magneto working for them. At least they kept the general look of the original yellow and blue costumes from back in '63. This was actually an extremely well-plotted film, with enough Hollywood gloss (CGi-driven battles, explosions, Kevin Bacon as the baddie, etc.) to be satisfying and it's not dumb, though the dialogue is. January Jones is so absolutely terrible at her chosen profession that it's amazing she's made it this far (and they gave her some strangely large boobs, maybe also with CGI?). If the studio continues to pump out a film like this every few years, I'll keep watching them, cause it appeals to the inner 12 year old inside.<br /><br />27 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    A Field in England<br />Ben Wheatley, UK , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />i don't know what to make of <i>A Field in England</i>. I'm pretty sure that Ben Wheatley is something remarkable, even if I've enjoyed each of his chronological works less than the previous one, because he's clearly trying to explore territory no one else is doing in British cinema, all while keeping his creations accessible. This isn't that accessible, being a period drama set in a muddy field with lengthy hallucinations, but at least features some recognisable actors and a somewhat brief running time. All of Wheatley's films have maintained a very very dark humour while examining English geography, whether it be <i>Down Terrace</i>'s urban tenements or the malevolent countrysides of the other films. The conceit of this film - the period setting and confusing plot - take a backseat to the visceral, emotional impact of the violence and grime, something only hinted at with <i>Kill List</i>'s darkest moments. There's no way I would watch this again, or even really recommend it, but Wheatley definitely shoots to the top of my list of filmmakers whose next work I highly anticipate.<br /><br />27 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Hunger Games<br />Gary Ross, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I have no idea why I watched this. This was really, really poorly made and a confusing, somewhat unethical mess that I assume will resolve somewhat when the sequels come out. The premise is pretty straight-forward, having been done a zillion times before. The plot was probably novel to many readers/viewers but it just seemed to be a hybrid of <i>Most Dangerous Game, Battle Royale, Series 7: The Contenders, Lord of the Flies, The Truman Show, Cabin in the Woods</i> and lots of <i>Death Race 2000 </i>-- but I still think my favourite film in this "genre" is <i>La decima vittima</i>. Jennifer Lawrence is so supremely watchable that I got through this, but the running time was way, way too long, padded out by needless flashbacks to earlier parts of the film which made me think that possibly my .mp4 file was corrupted. (Oh, problems of a compulsive film downloader). Again, not having read the books (and trust me, that ain't happening) I may be misunderstanding a lot, but this was very clunky even in its self-contained existence. The film takes so long to get started, with seemingly endless exposition, yet still manages to not be enough, especially in terms of the love triangle. We also learn, repeatedly, about how one must court 'sponsors', even speding a good 30 minutes of the film portraying this courting, only to see sponsorship take place once in the actual game -- and if I understood right, it was a gift sent by Woody Harrelson's character anyway. To the credit of the writer and filmmakers, I thought it was a pretty good dystopia, as film dystopias go - it didn't bog us down too much in its politics or backstory, and managed to maintain a nice balance of totalitarian menace and consumer fantasy within its construction, and a dark-yet-goofy aesthetic. Said menace, however, could have been more menacing in the film - the message is quite mixed, as instead of destroying the horrible system, Lawrence wins it. (Again, I'm sure this will be addressed in the sequels). I didn't have a huge problem with children killing children, as that's the entire point -- but it's awful this was rated PG-13 whereas the mild display of human sexuality will earn an R. And Lawrence's character ends up killing others, in self-defense, sure, but seemingly without much guilt - I was sort of imagining that as a Hollywood hero, she would somehow take a moral high ground. In a way it's refreshing that they didn't cop out on the brutality, but then they didn't make it hurt. Violence, to me, is only acceptable in cinema when there's an emotional gutpunch attached. Apart from the little black girl, there's no death in this film that contains any psychic pain. Lawrence, Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz (!) were a joy to watch. Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson were not.<br /><br />29 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Zone<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />It's been awhile since I've watched any Swanberg so I jumped at this one, which I guess is a trilogy with <i>Art History </i>and <i>Silver Bullets</i>. The first 45 minutes of this were mesmerising, a map of intimacy unlike anything I've ever seen in cinema. I found myself swept away without any concern for plot, meaning or resolution. And then, everything changes, and this turns into the most "meta" of films, and I say that having seen lots of metafiction. When Swanberg himself took centre stage, I admit I found myself underwhelmed by the themes (which I thought were explored better in <i>Alexander the Last</i> and <i>Silver Bullets</i>). The heavy-handed intervention of the filmmaker in his own film here made this most interesting in a <i>Symbiopsycotaxiplasm</i> manner, whcih is probably not what's intended -- where the question is about what is real and what is fiction; however, I was still into this, partially because of the obvious soul-searching laid bare in the final scenes. Even if it's  bit contrived, I think my admiration for Swanberg's work went up after seeing this. And the eroticism is pretty full-on here, which actually utilised the warmth between the director and actors to enhance the pornographic, even as we are shown how fictitious the intimacy is. The iPhone footage really worked, and it felt a million levels beyond <i>LOL</i>. I'm going to watch <i>Art History</i> next and I'll just keep going until my appetite for his work is finally quenched.<br /><br />30 November 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Avengers Assemble<br />Joss Whedon, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>Avengers</i> was exactly what I heard - a fun romp made palatable by Joss Whedon's light-hearted script, which never takes itself too seriously. This was actually funny - not just "superhero movie funny", but genuinely so, and because of that I enjoyed this, although the plot didn't interest me at all. None of these characters do much for me (I'm realising that my superhero interests pretty much start and end with X-Men) but Ruffalo and Downey inject enough humanity into them to keep it moving. Whedon clearly remembers that comic books are supposed to be comic, and thus the gods and monsters attacking the earth weren't enough to have me tune out. The post-credits shot of the characters at a kebab shop was great.<br /><br />30 November 2013<br />Gentlemen Broncos<br />Jared Hess, USA , 2009<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I hated <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> but for some reason decided to give this a shot. The first half-hour or so had me, but then Hess refused to let it evolve into anything more than a collection of easy jokes and forced awkwardness. Both this and <i>Dynamite</i> were built around a mocking attack on misfits, with the mean streak removed but no genuine admiration substituted. It's empty, and the only non-Jemaine Clement funny parts were just like fifth-rate Tim and Eric humour. This guy is like a more benevolent Todd Solondz. except without anything beneath the surface. Clement's exaggerated character was entertaining, and kept me semi-engaged - but then a deus ex machina comes along and just wraps everything up quickly, almost like Hess was as bored making this as I was watching it.<br /><br />30 November 2013<br />Dark Horse<br />Todd Solondz, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I was trying to get to sleep early as I had a 7:30 AM boat, but couldn't, so I put on this trek through utter human misery. Solondz once again makes us endure a bunch of unhappy people, portrayed somewhat as anti-heroes, but without the slightest bit of sympathy. This reminded me of <i>A Serious Man</i> in its relentlessness, except with far less artistry and a sense of humour that failed to make me laugh, maybe not even once. Mia Farrow and Christopher Walken were somewhat out of water here, as they should have been in a better film. If I sound really negative about this that's because I really didn't care for it or see any value in watching it.<br /><br />04 December 2013<br />Primer<br />Shane Carruth, \nUSA , 2004<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file on projector<br />I wonder if I'll ever get tired of <i>Primer</i>. Ags had never seen it, so even though it was 1:30 AM we started watching it and somehow I stayed awake; it's a short running time, after all, but not the easiest film to watch when you are tired. I think the copy I downloaded wasn't the greatest rip; I remember this being crisper, even though it's a 16mm work all the way. I found myself focusing on the awkward elements of this film stylistically - the narrating by Aaron(2), the very bizarre editing, etc. The first 20 minutes of this is really insane, unlike anything ever to come before it, and probably unlike anything after except perhaps <i>Upstream Color</i>. Despite the distance and emotionless characterisations, I found myself really affected this time because I was seeing this as about a loss of trust, more than it was about time-travel. Afterwards I fell asleep poring over that crazy obsessive timetable which someone put online and actually think I 'understand' <i>Primer</i>'s plot now, more than ever before at least. This remains an absolutely remarkable achievement and one of my favourite films ever.<br /><br />06 December 2013<br />That's My Boy<br />Sean Anders, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Getting through the Adam Sandler challenge is going to be more difficult than I thought. An R-rated Sandler flick is probably much harder to enjoy than one aimed at kids. I've never seen any of his films besides <i>Punch Drunk Love </i>and <i>Funny People</i> but got exactly what I expected; no surprises here, except maybe how low the lowest common denominator can be. I like Andy Samberg (<i>Brooklyn Nine Nine</i> has been my guilty pleasure of TV this autumn) and his presence really saved this - as he genuinely tried to play the straight man with empathy and pathos, and mostly succeeds despite what he's given to work with. Sandler goes through the whole film (and I assume his whole career) in the man-child mode, this time afflicted with a terrible Boston accent. The film began with a gay joke, and then a juvenile handjob comment, and from that it went downhill. The misogyny and cheap racial stereotypes were just par for the course. But I found myself laughing often, mostly at the fact I was watching it, or the bizarre cameos of Rex Ryan and Dan Patrick. I watched a lot of Police Academy films when I was a kid and I guess this stuff is the modern day equivalent. It was actually a challenge figuring out which parts were made intentionally dumber by smart people, and I stopped counting all the unnecessary tags, like Will Forte saying "A pubic hair!" for no reason except to make an 11 year old laugh. It would be interesting to look at the psychology of Sandler's characters, except I guess <i>Punch Drunk Love</i> already did that. Samberg really is too talented for this crap (not to mention James Caan and Susan Sarandon!) but at least he was there, and hopefully made major bank for doing this.<br /><br />06 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Jack and Jill<br />Dennis Dugan, USA , 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />So. Removed from the gross-out, intentional offensiveness, Adam Sandler films are just really... broad. It was hard to hate<i> Jack and Jill</i> but certainly hard to enjoy it also. Built entirely around the concept that Adam Sandler in drag was funny, the film created a far-fetched plot about a megalomaniacal Al Pacino, as himself, falling in love with the She-Sandler and everyone learns the true value of family and happiness at the end. The only thing surprising about this, to me, was that Sandler actually <i>is</i> funny in drag; despite the overly broad attempts at humour, he still manages to infuse a bit of pathos into this ridiculous hybrid of Tootsie and Dana Carvey's Church Lady, and I must admit I chuckled a few times. I was thankful when it ended, and I am in no way excited to watch <i>Grown Ups 2</i>, the final film of the Adam Sandler challenge.<br /><br />09 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Grown Ups 2<br />Dennis Dugan, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />OK, I did it - three Adam Sandler films in four days. The programmer of this insane challenge suggested this viewing order, which went from bad to worse, or offensive to family-friendly, or something - the point is, I found myself longing for the dick jokes of <i>That's my Boy </i>after about a half-hour of this. But eventually I gave in, and realised that this is a masterpiece - an American vision, celebrating community while pastiching classics of arthouse cinema into a palatable format. The most obvious antecedent to <i>Grown Ups 2</i> is that of Fellini's <i>Amarcord</i>, except instead of a thundering Nino Rota score, we get the J. Geils Band. But like <i>Amarcord</i>, <i>Grown Ups 2</i> is a series of vignettes about modern life, the challenges of maturity, and the changing values of masculinity - but transposed from rural Italy to postmodern America. Sandler's Lenny Feder is the true anti-hero, a man written out of the plot; he's overshadowed by Chris Rock's blackness, David Spader's freewheeling independence, and Kevin James's pure mass; the responsible, creative white male in America finds his world closing in, much like Walter White in <i>Breaking Bad</i>. But Feder doesn't turn to crime or drugs; instead, he turns to himself, and finds in family a reinforcement of the same American suburban values that auteur Dennis Dugan is obviously critiquing. Irony? Or should we celebrate this genteel conviction? This is a rich tapestry of American life circa 2013, and like the masterpieces of John Cassavetes, these men are struggling, finding simple pleasures in asserting their independence through visits to K-Mart, jumping into swimming holes, etc. Their subdued libidos of suburban life are a not-so-hidden subtext throughout; Dugan populates the film exclusively with large-breasted, yet married women; their cleavages overflowing, the male wish fulfillment is restricted to wishful thinking over juice boxes (except for Jon Lovitz's physical manifestation of these desires - a character who is perhaps a spectre or hallucination). Likewise, gay rights are addressed in a sensitive and nuanced way, as this town is one where gay men are comfortable being out of the closet, and school bus drivers have a fluid sense of their own sexual boundaries. But sex aside, <i>Grown Ups 2</i> is a masterpiece of memory; a personal vision. The overwhelming stench of rotting nostalgia is like a worm inside this apple; the penultimate scene, as the grown-ups look over their old high school yearbook, is shot with the same wistful confusion as Wim Wenders' <i>Paris, Texas</i>. Yes, these are memories, captured forever as photographs, but were they real? And do they mean anything anymore? While this enough would be a bittersweet reality to leave the perfect 'movie magic' in my heart, Dugan and Sandler take things even further: by staging a massive, violent eruption between the partygoers at Sandler's house and a gang of white-bread fraternity goers. This hostility simmers beneath the surface of the entire film, the dark reality behind the picket fences - it's as pure of an <i>homage</i> to <i>Blue Velvet</i> as I've ever seen, and the ensuing chaos is immaculately choreographed. I have ever seen anything combining Lynch's ugly subconscious with Fellini's provincial celebrations before; surely the scene where Shaquille O'Neal throws someone over a house is meant to the supernatural uberman inside us all, the "Bob" of <i>Twin Peaks</i>, to make another Lynch comparison. That the film's chief antagonist meets his demise via deer antlers even suggests a longing for a primeval return to nature - which recalls the great film experimentalists of Bruce Baillie or Joseph Cornell. Hopefully this work will get it's dues when the awards come around.<br /><br />15 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Tyrannosaur<br />Paddy Considine, UK , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Paddy Considine as auteur is surprisingly austere; <i>Tyrannosaur </i>is a true study in Yorkshire misery that's generally well-done, if maybe hitting its points a little too predictably. Peter Mullan is stunning, bringing the lead role all of the complex gravitas it needs, and Olivia Colman is great here without any comic presence, working through some truly difficult scenes. It looked like a fairly standard redemption story, and thus I was pleasantly surprised by what I guess you would call the 'twist' - but I don't know how much I would want to watch this again. It's well-done, though I'm not always in the mood to wallow in British tough nastiness. I suppose it's a relief that this one didn't rely on a gangster/crime plot. The quality of the acting alone is enough to carry this, but I mostly found myself happy that I didn't live in the UK any longer. I suspect this is a lot what Mike Leigh films are like, though I've never actually seen a Mike Leigh film (note to self: watch some Mike Leigh films).<br /><br />16 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    It&#x27;s a Disaster<br />Todd Berger, USA , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>It's a Disaster</i> was an incredibly pleasant surprise; a comedy about the end of the world that unlike Seth Rogen or Edgar Wright's efforts, actually relied on awkwardness as a comedic factor and eschewed special effects entirely. From the opening scene, with David Cross and Julia Styles debating whether or not to listen to the end of the <i>1812 Overture</i> on the radio, I was laughing; the beats are perfect, the drama relatively low, and there's no copouts towards religion or morality. It's low-key in that <i>Melvin Goes to Dinner</i> way, and it doesn't wear out its welcome. The characters are slightly exaggerated and all sort of unlikeable, but not enough to be caricatures, and probably a quite believable set of personality traits for people who have supposedly been friends for a decade. The twist at the end, if it's a twist, is great.<br /><br />15 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Prince Avalanche<br />David Gordon Green, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I'm not going to call this a "return to form" for David Gordon Green because I don't think there's anything wrong with him making silly comedy films, if that is what he wants to do. This wasn't <i>The Sitter</i>, but it wasn't <i>George Washington </i>either. It's a simple film, by which I don't mean slight; built around the dynamics of Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch, and with a striking setting, it juggles light comedic interactions with more serious character studies. Now I like Paul Rudd as much as everyone else, and it's nice to see him flex his wings a bit (this is probably his most challenging role, emotionally) but I think his limitations as a dramatic actor were evident here. The one stunning part of this film is where Rudd comes across a woman whose house burnt down, which I later read was not an actress but an actual victim of the wildfires who they came across while filming. This is a beautiful, dream-like sequence that uses cinema's potential for manipulating memory as well as anything I've ever seen. The cinematography stays rooted in a wistful deep ecology, making Hirsch's horny banter a jarring juxtaposition. I have to say I really loved this overall and it's definitely better than <i>Your Highness</i>. The dramatic arc of Rudd's mood swings (as well as the way this was edited) honestly reminded me of <i>Eastbound and Down</i>, though maybe I'm just reaching for a connection here.<br /><br />22 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Imposter<br />Bart Layton, UK , 2012<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />A true exercise in documentary manipulation, <i>The Imposter</i> is such an insane story that it remains compelling throughout, despite the shady nature of the filmmaker himself. Layton puts the imposter front and centre in this film, and he's a charming, fascinating figure (which is no doubt the secret to his success as a con artist). I fell for his attempts to build sympathy before twisting it around back against the family, with his big accusation. At least Layton's own bias is obvious; the lacks the morally ambiguous beauty of <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> though that's the obvious comparison. He uses every trick in the book to ratchet up the suspense, building up to the big reveal of the private investigator digging a hole in someone's yard. At this point I've just come to accept the re-enactments as the language of most non-fiction film these, days, which is a shame, because I'm not fond of them in general. They're done OK here, not too cute or obtrusive -- but if the director had a bit more artistic sense I think this would be better, particularly if he followed the 'less is more' strategy. There's apparently a new documentary about the MOVE bombings in Philadelphia which is made with only original footage and no narration or talking heads; I think I'm going to have to check that out as a stylistic antidote to this.<br /><br />23 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Wrong Cops<br />Quentin Dupieux, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Dupieux does it again, which is: making an under-90 minute collection of absurd nonsense, which somehow wears thin by the end, even though it has such a short running time. This is a spin-off of <i>Wrong</i> and was built mostly around Mark Burnham's oafish douchebag cop, Duke. The biggest difference between this and his other two films is that <i>Wrong Cops</i> goes very, very broad. And with mixed success. The potential for true, absurd surrealism is mostly wasted, though there are a few brilliant moments. I don't know if Dupieux thought he was going to break through the mainstream here, but this is a sloppily-assembled film which looks in some scenes absolutely terrible - there's little post-processing to hide the bare DV quality, and a few times the camera zooms in like a kid is adjusting the lens. (Which is really a shame, because another thing I like about <i>Wrong</i> is its striking, well-composed visual sense). Despite cheap, easy jokes about weed and boobs, I wouldn't say this is garbage;. Burnham's great - a real comic talent - and Marilyn Manson absolutely destroys in his scenes. Eric Wareheim is always good as a creep, though he tries to steal the picture with <i>Tim &amp; Eric</i> style behaviour. What I really couldn't understand is some of the unfinished jokes - setups that seemed like they could get really weird (and certainly would in <i>Wrong</i>) but here are just tossed off time wasters, like Duke and Steve Little yelling at the kid in the diner. Little is good here, actually distinguishing himself from Stevie Janowski, and looking a lot like Bill Simmons. But ultimately this is a disappointment. What I liked so much about <i>Wrong</i> was its absolutely throw-out-the-rulebook weirdness; without that, its just an easy comedy with offbeat actors. Dupieux's problem is that he's not actually very funny; he has to wrap his humour in nonsense and a strange atmosphere in order to deliver. I guess he was trying to show he's more, hmmm, I guess not mature, but maybe doesn't need absurd nonsense as a crutch. Unfortunately, the absurd nonsense is the only thing I'm looking for.<br /><br />24 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Art History<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br /><i>Art History</i> is the first part (I think) of a trilogy with <i>Silver Bullets</i> and <i>The Zone</i>, essentially all the same plot where Swanberg plays himself as a filmmaker and the plot, if you can call it that, revolves around the tension of acting in sexually explicit situations. This is probably the most erotic of the three films and also the one that goes the shortest in exploring the consequences of that topic. I guess at this point it feels crazy to have watched 3 films like this, which are slightly different in construct but ultimately could have been done as one film. But then, perhaps, maybe it's interesting to see an artist going through something and revising a topic/obsession. I think all of his films that I've seen have dealt centrally with artifice and sexuality, and the intimacy between the people in this one is probably the most genuine and convincing of them all. There's a few moments here where Swanberg's genius is evident: the night swimming pool scenes, and the amplified sounds of furniture bumping and other domestic sounds, during the 'off-camera' sex scene (which sounded like the first Lambkin/Lescaleet CD at points).<br /><br />24 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Execution in Autumn<br />Hsing Lee, Taiwan , 1972<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />My Christmas Eve was spent reading and staring a screens. I watched this, followed by the Amazon series <i>Alpha House</i> which was a strange shift in tone. <i>Execution in Autumn</i> is a Taiwanese period piece, set in the Han dynasty (so somewhere between 200 BCE and 200 AD, but I had to look that up) and following the story of a man imprisoned for murder whose grandmother tries desperate to free him. This takes on the style of Hollywood melodrama, with moving string music and closeups on tear-drenched faces, but I admit I found it rather compelling. The set was beautiful - the prison was constructed mostly out of wood and the costuming and facial hair made this feel like a kung-fu movie, but without any kung-fu (and I'm sorry to say that's the best comparison I can make for Chinese cinema). I'm not sure what the lesson learned is - that parents should be harsh disciplinarians? - and I don't completely understand if the lead character is supposed to be someone we feel sympathy for, as his crimes aren't exactly justified. Nonetheless, this was a welcome diversion.<br /><br />25 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Extraordinary Adventures of Ad&#xE8;le Blanc-Sec<br />Luc Besson, France , 2010<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I felt like a fun, big-budget adventure film and was thinking about <i>Tintin</i> but couldn't quite bring myself to watch it. This adaptation of a similar comic, French instead of Belgian but from the same time period, was done in big crowd-pleasing style by Luc Besson. His debt to American cinema is saturated throughout , as Spielberg's influence is all over this. The Egyptian adventure in the first act is a pure synthesis of <i>Raider of the Lost Ark</i> with some <i>Goonies</i>, and it made me long for the feeling Indiana Jones gave me as a youth.  Unfortunately, the final half hour turns more <i>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i>, with re-animated mummies inexplicably speaking French. It's cute though, and the overall Frenchness of it made it tolerable. The Blanc-Sec character is a strong protagonist who doesn't need relationships or men to define herself (hooray, it passes the Bechdel test!) though she certainly isn't denied sexuality. The two plots are rather clumsily stitched together and I would have enjoyed a bit more pterodactyl and a bit less mummies, yet I can't really complain for it was good at what it was. And the ending is a wonderfully evil way to end a film, which would never ever happen in America. Overall I guess I felt a bit like I would feel watching a <i>National Treasure</i> movie, which is 33 years old and unable to really fall into the adventure wholeheartedly but trying to appreciate well-crafted entertainment.<br /><br />25 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Mauvais sang<br />Leos Carax, France , 1986<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This was absolutely fucking amazing; a film that justifies why one should bother making films after so many have been made before. There were so many reference points here, yet none so overwhelming that it dwarfed what Carax achieved artistically, which was an intense exploration of youth and commitment designed around a thrilling plot and with an incredible visual style. My only real knowledge of mid-80s French cinema is Godard, and around this time he was going back towards his noir influences with films like <i>Prénom Carmen </i>and <i>Détective</i>. There's a lot of that on display here, but not too much to feel derivative or overly postmodern. <i>Mauvais sang</i> is like a really complex beer with a lot of flavours, but perfectly balanced. In all seriousness, this film was as close to perfect as I've ever seen. There's so much to love - Denis Lavant's fiery, passionate performance vs Michel PIccoli's understated, distant one; the strange framing, extreme closeups and bizarre spatial sense; the long sequence of Binoche and Lavant at night, with the David Bowie breakdown in the middle. These are all things that could easy tip the scales into hacky arthouse shit or incoherent rambling but Carax holds it all together. From the opening scene, this announces itself as something groundbreaking, even if it is a pastiche of other forms. It's audacious when it goes big (the action sequence, the parachute sequence, Lavant flipping over the car) and when it goes small (the interior scenes, the aforementioned Bowie-fueled rage). Carax even throws in some seemingly unstable decisions, like making the police inspector a wacky goofball slapstick character, totally incongruous with the rest of the tone of the film -- and yet it works. In the plot, there's no ambiguity, yet there's nothing proscriptive about it either. I'm probably just raving here, but that's because this really blew me away.<br /><br />25 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Warm Bodies<br />Jonathan Levine, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I was committed to watching a bunch of films today, but after <i>Mauvais sang</i> my brain was reeling and I wanted something light to take it down a notch. (Oh, what's happened to me? In the past I would have probably tried to watch increasingly difficult work in an attempt to induce some sort of cinematic psychosis in myself. Now I take the easy way out). <i>Warm Bodies</i> is another effort in the mainstreaming of zombie films and one that I'm sure would infuriate zombie purists as it has not only hope, but a straight-up happy ending and is about zombies being cured. Well, the only thing worse than being a zombie is being a zombie purist so I just tried to enjoy this, and I didn't mind it at all. The teenage romance angle was a bit heavy-handed for me cause I do hate that shit, but every time I started to get overly saturated with cheap saccharine, it would shift to a half-decent suspense/action sequence. The acting was actually good, or as good as a zombie comedy could be, and it was a decent enough way to pass the time.<br /><br />26 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The Garden of the Finzi-Continis<br />Vittorio De Sica, Italy / West Germany , 1970<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />This is a cinematic classic though I didn't really know much about it, and I never finished <i>Bicycle Thieves</i> so I've actually never seen anything by de Sica before. This proceeded very much in a classical form, and the exploration of class and identity still holds up well. It's interesting to see how late 30's Italian Jews resemble American WASPs from New England in the current era, or maybe I just see tennis whites and nothing else. For as traditional of a "drama" as this is, there's a definite sense of fear and enclosure in the final 20 minutes, as the Nazi/Fascist regime slowly closes in. I found myself wondering what they were going to end it on, and the choice seems a bit off but I guess it had to stop somewhere. This upper-class denial of reality is probably one fairly unique to the era, and in some ways this probably can stand against other critiques of wealthy lifestyle, even Sofia Coppola's work in some ways.<br /><br />26 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    The American Friend<br />Wim Wenders, West Germany / France , 1977<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />A pleasant surprise. I expected a gritty, European noir and it was in some ways, though Wenders has a way of lighting interior scenes (at least comparing this to <i>Paris, Texas</i> which is really the only other work of his that I know) which is spooky and supernatural. Lots of greens and reds, often from visible light sources in the frame which cast a realistic pallor over everything - I loved it. The plot was good - I didn't realise until it was over that it's a "Ripley" adventure, with Hopper perfect as the bene/malevolent title character and Bruno Ganz as the real centrepiece. I didn't let myself get too wrapped up in the plot, which is a web of deceit, and probably falls apart upon close scrutiny (how anyone could fall for the medical results being doctored is absurd). In many ways, this is just like <i>Breaking Bad</i>. This wasn't half as great as <i>Paris, Texas</i> though I don't think much could be.<br /><br />26 December 2013<br />\n    \n    \n    Martha Marcy May Marlene<br />Sean Durkin, USA , 2011<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Despite my reservations about the way this dealt with the cult, <i>Martha Marcy May Marlene</i> was overall fantastic. At first I was hesitant that this was another film portraying intentional communities as vampiric sex cults that occupy gullible people like parasites all for one power-hungry leader. And after a few scenes I was thinking how that stupid comedy with Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston is so far the only film I've ever seen that shows intentional communities as having some positive traits. But there's a difference between a 'cult' and an 'intentional community' and once I realised that this film was going full-on "cult" I accepted it and actually began to appreciate how it showed John Hawkes manipulating the confused young women under his thumb. The way he would appeal to their weaknesses, telling the thrice-titular that she is a teacher and a leader (where clearly she is nothing of the sort) as well as his intense charisma - it's certainly something I've seen even in more benign, non-cult situation. Elizabeth Olsen is fantastic here and the film is far darker that it seems on the surface, though it doesn't seem like a light romp to begin with. The bifurcated structure is essential to how great this was, as it reveals things to the viewer when appropriate, almost like a horror film (and indeed, the dark turn towards violence at the end wasn't particularly necessary but delivered some adrenaline which certainly didn't hurt). The visual segues became a little bit much for me, starting to make me feel battered and perhaps in the mindset of Olsen's character. And the ending provides just enough ambiguity to make this fun, without said ambiguity being particularly necessary. On top of everything, you get two Jackson C. Frank songs.<br /><br />02 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    The Secret Life of Walter Mitty<br />Ben Stiller, USA , 2013<br />Location: Solaris Kino<br />Format: cinema projection<br />Recovering from the flu, and even more importantly recovering from 7 days of Fictiocracy, I escaped to the multiplex to indulge in Ben Stiller's big-budget fantasy, which is itself about escapism. I have never found Stiller to be anything close to a comic genius, but I would say he is comically competent, even if I don't think he's particularly imaginative. Seeing a great classic film re-made this way was disappointing, because as much as the film is about dreaming and achieving your potential, <i>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</i> is remarkably pedestrian. It's a family-friendly film all the way, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it's billed as a comedy and it isn't actually funny apart from 2 or 3 jokes which rose above the tame boundaries. The visual look of the film is its greatest achievement - not just the epic tourist photography of Greenland or Iceland, but the muted blues and grays of the <i>Life</i> magazine office, a look straight out of that forgotten Zach Galifianakis film, <i>Visioneers</i>. But visual grandeur alone is not enough; the film played it so safe that it failed to give Stiller's Mitty any personality, which maybe was supposed to be the point, but the journey/epiphany experience so central to films like this made it evident that something was missing. Stiller can't be bland, even though he is kinda bland, because he doesn't think he's bland (does that make any sense)? His performance is erratic and subdued while somehow still trying too hard. Beyond him, we have Adam Scott failing to convince me that he's a dick, and Patton Oswalt probably giving the best overall performance in the film. Kathryn Hahn is just starting to annoy me and Sean Penn basically phoned it in; I did think Kristin Wiig was likeable as the love interest, but the whole dating website/dream girl shit just fell flat. For a film that supposedly celebrates celluloid film (and judging from the background shots of Mittys apartment, vinyl LPs) and experiential gusto that can't be marketed or digitised, it sure relied on digital effects and product placement; how much did Papa John's and Cinnabon pay to co-finance this film? Such corporate integration into art is so complete in 2014 that it's barely noticeable, yet it seems counter to the fuzzy, intangible (and weakly committed-to) ethics at the core of this film - that the sublime has been rendered irrelevant in the name of profit.<br /><br />02 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    All the Light in the Sky<br />Joe Swanberg, USA , 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: digital file projected on wall<br />I suspected this might be a "return to form" after <i>Drinking Buddies</i>, the form being no-budget experimentalism like <i>The Zone</i>. While this lacked the star power of <i>Drinking Buddies</i>, it felt similarly in awe of the potential of its own plot(lessness), as if the relationships between friends being potentially romantic was a groundbreaking new idea. And visually, it was stunning. I suspect Swanberg was inspired to make this film because of the beachfront apartment that its lead character inhabits. The ocean is a presence throughout the film, providing a perhaps heavy analogy to time and aging, which Jane Adams deals with. This is a younger filmmaker, making a film with an actress who cowrote it, and thus the simplicity/complexity of her character is not only believable, but it's almost shockingly real. The same Swanbergisms are on display throughout; sexuality, surfaces, and odd timing. But he's happy to just film the sea or the titular sky for moments at a time, giving this a placid naturalism that makes it quite palatable. Adams is stunning here; I can't say enough about how intense her performance is, even though it's the lightest I've ever seen.<br /><br />07 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    22nd of May<br />Koen Mortier, Belgium / Netherlands , 2010<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Holy unengaging! Mortier's previous film, <i>Ex Drummer</i>, was a devilishly entertaining romp that regardless of its flaws was extremely memorable. In <i>22 mei</i>, he shifts gears as far as possible, instead creating a very serious narrative about terrorism, guilt and innocence. This was trying to do a Dostoevsky thing, I think, but with a lot of parallel timelines or maybe just fantasy sequences piling up. As the event of the film continued to unfold and re-fold itself, I was really struggling to pay attention. I think I even dozed off by the end. I'm not sure if this is Mortier's fault for making a boring film or just my own failure to pay attention; perhaps there are some lingering illness/sleep issues for me too. Either way, I didn't care about this in the slightest.<br /><br />09 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    A.C.O.D.<br />Stu Zicherman, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />It's innocuous, yeah, and followed a fairly predictable plot, but I enjoyed <i>A.C.O.D. </i>throughout. This isn't so much due to Adam Scott, who was fine (playing a character similar in tics and uptightness to his <i>Parks and Rec</i> role, so the backstory felt already there) but because of Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara. They're such a pleasure to watch that I'm sure I could enjoy them in anything. O'Hara, Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler are comedic actors who I'm so used to seeing go into extreme wackiness mode, so this realistic narrative which forced them to be more controlled was intriguing, but they all handled it well and actually probably brought even more to the film. This had other strong performances, and a script that was actually funny, and I found myself invested enough in the characters to stay with it. Light entertainment, sure, but at least it was reasonably intelligent, not mean-spirited, and tried to transcend mere comedy without becoming heavy-handed.<br /><br />09 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    Her<br />Spike Jonze, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />Wow, what a stunning accomplishment. <i>Her</i> isn't perfect, but it's a lot more than it seems at first. At first I thought this was something like an episode of <i>Black Mirror</i> or an unwritten Philip K Dick novel, wrapped up in the technological novelty of the premise. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing here - even outdoing his performance in <i>The Master</i> or at least having the virtue of accessibility and warmth this time around; and Jonze hits all the marks right, from the impeccably framed and shot future world (one of the most strangely appealing of any cinematic future I've seen) to the perfectly written dialogue, with every hesitation and beat down to a science. Initially, I felt that this was a bit of cinematic snake oil for an easy, obvious satirical observation about our obsession with technology, but the satire seemed hidden behind a wall of genuine concern and sympathy for the character(s) - surely, in a few years this would seem hopelessly dated, like old 60's counterculture films or even Red scare commie plots seem now. But at some point I realised that <i>Her</i>, like anything else this masterful, correctly views technology as a layer - a novel one, sure, but not the meat of the story. This is really a film about love and intimacy, and it's incredibly universal despite the apparent distance of its main narrative device. There's no satire at all, and Jonze was actually quite brave in making something so sincere. Phoenix is presented without judgement, except by Rooney Mara, whose character is the one truly out of step with <i>Her</i>'s world. It's an over the top emotional film - the Nic Roeg-style flashbacks are almost unbearably sad, steeped in loss and regret, and it's to Phoenix's credit again that he carries this baggage without letting it overwhelm him. His demeanour shifts as the story demands, and by putting us right in his brain, Jonze sweeps us along for this torrent of feeling. I really would say this is the closest cinematic equivalent to David Foster Wallace, or at least what he was trying to achieve in his writing and felt he never could. For something so relentlessly futuristic-modern on the surface, <i>Her</i> is ultimately a classical construction all the way through. Maybe my biggest criticism is that it doesn't seem to offer anything except a reinforcement of traditional approaches to dealing with love and loss; this is a minor point though, because the film's main point isn't loss, but a questioning of what the relationship between any two people is and could be. (I wrote "humans" instead of "people" in the previous sentence, though clearly when dealing with this film, both words fail). Overall: brilliant.<br /><br />10 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    The Wolf of Wall Street<br />Martin Scorsese, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />I semi-recently watched <i>Casino</i> and found <i>Wolf of Wall Street </i>to be essentially a retread, replacing the violence of the former with comedy; DeNiro with DiCaprio; Sharon Stone with whomever that was; Pesci with Jonah Hill. That's an oversimplification, and I did (mostly) enjoy <i>Wolf</i> while I (mostly) hated <i>Casino</i>, but that's maybe a matter of taste: I'll generally take laughs over violence if given the choice. I knew before watching this that it's been lauded as a year's best, Oscar favourite, etc. so I had a slight bias against it - childish, I know. I think that the current generation of critics were weaned on Scorsese films, so many feel like an overblown, testosterone-driven blast of grandeur equals "great acting". Having just watched <i>Her</i>, which is about the polar opposite in terms of Phoenix's performance, I can see merits in both approaches - one more look-at-me performative vs. one more subtle - but I think it takes far more talent to excel in the subdued roles. In <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i>, nothing is subdued, which is the point. DiCaprio works, I guess, because I generally find him so unlikeable and this character certainly was. But I am tired of this style of tough-guy bombast being heralded as the pinnacle of American cinema. It's filtered into a new generation of actors, with the mania evident in some of Robert Downey Jr. or Sam Rockwell's performances, but those guys cut it with a bit of contemporary reflection: not only irony but a more complex psychology than <i>Raging Bull</i>, for sure. There's none of that here - no vulnerability for DiCaprio or Hill, and that's fine because this is just an entertaining lark. But why does it have to be 3 hours? You could have cut out at least 45 minutes of repetitive debauchery, or just cut out the downfall entirely. Gordon Gecko is namedropped here and it's hard not to think about Stone's <i>Wall Street</i>; both of these films are supposed to be critical of the Wall Street excess, but both fail I think. <i>Wall Street</i> because Stone's a shitty filmmaker, and <i>Wolf of Wall Street </i>because there's a prurient fascination (and latent admiration) of the crimes and excesses of Belfort and gang. Yeah, there's supposedly a morality tale in there somewhere but it's easy to get lost amongst the cocaine, yachts and hookers. And for as outrageous as Belfort's story is, his lowbrow style is an outlier - the criminals like Lloyd Blankfein, who still walk this earth unpunished for their treachery, is far less entertaining. But the injustice is that there have been no major prosecutions for the recent Wall Street crimes since 2008, and Scorsese's film makes no comment on that. In fact, it's hard to take away anything from this except some laughter, and even the funny exchanges feel like scripts rejected from <i>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i> with more profanity. Like <i>Casino</i>, the female characters only exist to amplify and then challenge the swagger of the main character. There's nothing remotely close to a feminine consciousness represented here. The script isn't even well balanced; it's hard to understand why any scene is included or not, unless it's shocking or funny. The quaalude-drenched climax, if that is the climax, is some great physical comedy, but by this point I'd already lost interest. Usually I find decline more entertaining than ascent, but the ruination in this rags-to-riches-to-ruin story was so sloppy and uneven that I just wanted it to be over.<br /><br />10 January 2014<br />\n    \n    \n    American Hustle<br />David O. Russell, USA , 2013<br />Location: V96<br />Format: digital file on computer monitor<br />David O. Russell continues to disappoint, though I enjoyed this far more than his last two films since those were formulaic Hollywood pablum, and this at least had a fun, convoluted plot and Louis CK. But wow, what a mess. There's so many "big" actors packed into this that they're either fighting for the spotlight (Bale, Cooper, Adams) or woefully underused (Renner). It reminded me a bit of <i>Tropic Thunder</i> in that sense (and that sense only). But my God, Jennifer Lawrence is fucking brilliant in this film; she just soars over everything else like a mad eagle, and her sparks are so uplifting that it let me forgive the messy edges. I would have liked to see this veer more towards the Coen Brothers than Scorsese; having watched it in the same day as <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i>, I'm finding myself totally sick of New Jersey accents and tough-guy talk. But if the Coens had made this, the farce elements would be amplified beyond credibility, casting these characters as pure cartoons. In <i>American Hustle</i>, Russell's afraid to commit them too far into caricature, which is less preferable for me, because an almost-totally-ridiculous character is just sort of frustrating. (But there are a few scenes, like the interactions between Cooper and Louis CK, that do get into pure slapstick/screwball territory, which is why I felt this was so overall uneven). Bale is an undeniable talent, but it seemed almost like they tried too hard to emphasise his schlubby appearance. His relationship with Adams is believable, but is a "con man with a heart of gold" and better than a "hooker with a heart of gold"? I'm afraid to go back and watch <i>Three Kings</i> again because I'll probably find as much to tear apart in that as I do in these recent Russell disasters. Well, I'm being unfair - <i>American Hustle</i> far from a disaster - just too long and sloppy, which is essentially my complaint of every highly-acclaimed film. Maybe this was just a big excuse to get these actors into the fashion and aesthetic of the <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> era; that was done pretty well, and with a great soundtrack too. Can they give the Oscar to Adams or Lawrence's cleavage? Note: I would like to see Alessandro Nivola in more things; he was brilliant in <i>Ginger and Rosa</i> though barely present here.<br /><br />
