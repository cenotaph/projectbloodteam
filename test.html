It<br /><br /><br /><br />8 June 2003<br />3 Women<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1977<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A stunning film, possibly Altman's best, that is unlike anything else I've ever seen him do.  Amazingly creepy, hypnotic, and dreamlike, yet still focused on the superficiality of American popular culture.  Sissy Spacek is so unsettling that I'll never think of her the same way.  The plot has just the right amount of resolution to enhance its surreality.  Lots of symbolism, too, moreso than Altman usually sticks in.  I hope this comes out on DVD soon.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 June 2003<br />Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br />Michael Ian Black / Michael Showalter / David Wain, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />okay - I have now watched Stella with probably every single person I know.  Does that mean I can stop watching it now?<br /><br /><br /><br />15 June 2003<br />Possession<br />Andrzej Zulawski, France / West Germany, 1981<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />An incredible film that is really over the top and intense, yet full of ambiguity and surreality.  I'd like to see more by this director; this film is something that's been resonating with me all day even though it's such a fantastical plot.  The marraige breakup parts are comparable to Contempt in how visceral they are.  The horror film aspect is not overdone, which places this on the list of unconventional horror films I really like.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 June 2003<br />Chairman of the Board<br />Alex Zamm, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Bolam<br />What an amazing, strange feeling it is to list this on my spreadsheet.  Watching this was an in-joke between Bolam and I for about a year, and we finally watched it, and it was actually pretty funny.  It was a similar type of humour to UHF, and Carrot Top actually was funny when he wasn't doing his stupid inventions. <br /><br /><br /><br />17 June 2003<br />Secret d&#233;fense<br />Jacques Rivette, France, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I've wanted to see more Rivette since "Celine and Julie" is one of my all-time faves.  This is a very different type of story - starkly realistic and edgy - yet paced in the same lethargic manner.  It felt like half of the movie was just the main character taking trains and subways - which was sort of chilling and a nice commentary on public and private space, but at 166 minutes it got tiring.  The pacing however seems to be what his films are all about.  The acting was superb and the story was actually a very basic mystery but drawn out for maximum impact.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 June 2003<br />Batoru rowaiaru<br />Kinji Fukasaku, Japan, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Perverse entertainment like only the Japanese can come up with.  The "morals" to this film are pretty simplistic but the real fun is in the execution(s).  Beat Takeshi is amazing, too.  There should be a video game version of this.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 June 2003<br />Batoru rowaiaru<br />Kinji Fukasaku, Japan, 2000<br />Location: Liz's<br />Format: <br />Company: Liz, Pat<br />Watching this with other people is really fun - especially Pat.  Liz didn't seem too freaked out by it because it was so cartoonish and ridiculous. <br /><br /><br /><br />23 June 2003<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Kirker<br />Jason and I are now truly "friends" because we have watched this together.

Night Shyamalan, USA, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Pat and Liz<br />Oh my god - this was the most unbelieveably shitty thing I have seen in a long time.  Tomko lent it to me about 16 months ago, saying how it was "totally intense" but it was so fucking lame I felt guilty wasting 107 minutes watching it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />29 June 2003<br />Withnail &#38; I<br />Bruce Robinson, UK, 1987<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Caleb and Mike<br />I've watched this so many times yet I am never sick of it.  It is truly a masterpiece, and funny too.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2003<br />Stalker<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, West Germany / Soviet Union, 1979<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Incredibly haunting, and visually stunning.  I felt drawn to the Zone just as the characters were, and although the ending monologue seemed a little misplaced I loved this film, even more than Solaris I think.  Tarkovsky can do so much with a miniscule budget.  <br /><br /><br /><br />12 July 2003<br />Rushmore<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Darcy, Bill Fulmer<br />This is the most I have ever enjoyed Rushmore; perhaps it's when watching with Darcy or when sandwiched between the other two, but while I have always really liked this film, I loved it more than ever this time.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 July 2003<br />The Royal Tenenbaums<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 2001<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Darcy, Bill Fulmer, Miriam<br />Again, every time I watch this I love it more and more.  Definitely a masterpiece, I can actually enjoy all of it's overblown greatness.  I hope The Life Aquatic is even more ambitious.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 July 2003<br />Bottle Rocket<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 1996<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Darcy, Bill Fulmer<br />The first of the insane Wes Anderson triple feature.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 July 2003<br />Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl<br />Gore Verbinski, USA, 2003<br />Location: Manor<br />Format: <br />Company: Mom, Dad, Anthony, Miriam<br />Fun family movie outing.  This was a good mix of Evil Dead and swordfighting movies, and while a bit long provided 2 hours of solid entertainment.  The projectionist fell asleep in typical Squirrel Hill theater fashion, but that's part of the charm.  I do have to wonder just how good of an idea is it to base movies on amusement park rides?<br /><br /><br /><br />16 July 2003<br />Caddyshack<br />Harold Ramis, USA, 1980<br />Location: Andy's<br />Format: <br />Company: Andy, Miriam, Shahrzad<br />Not as funny as I remembered it being, but still pretty enjoyable.  Chevy Chase was totally in his prime, and there's enough weird, nonsensical Rodney Dangerfield parts to make it pretty entertaining.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 July 2003<br />J'irai comme un cheval fou<br />Fernando Arrabal, France, 1973<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A cornerstone of surrealist cinema, this is a classic example of film as a subversive art.   The imagery is shocking even when held against Bunuel or Jodorowsky; the story was captivating and there was a good bit of humour too.  Only touching on bigger themes like religion and morality, this movie really looked at the ideas of society and friendship - I guess it's actually a buddy movie in a way.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 July 2003<br />Kingpin<br />Bobby Farrelly / Peter Farrelly, USA, 1996<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: McDowell, Jeff<br />a funny movie, and a good one to watch with Jeff and McDowell.  I can't believe I've never seen this before.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 July 2003<br />The Godfather: Part II<br />Francis Ford Coppola, USA, 1974<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Thought I don't think it was as good as the first one, it was still really good, and again I don't know why I waited so long to finally see this.  Al Pacino was pretty amazing as he spiralled into evil, and my only complaint was that there wasn't enough DeNiro in it.  Also, it wasn't as violent.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2003<br />Viva la muerte<br />Fernando Arrabal, France / Tunisia, 1971<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Arrabal's first film is an undisputed masterpiece.  Though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as "Cheval Fou," this is probably because I missed some of the end of this film, since the DVD was skipping and not playing correctly.  Dealing with themes of death and religion, this is a brutal view of Franco's Spain through the eyes of a child, as he struggles to understand power, betrayal, corruption, sexuality, and violence.  The fantasy sequences are tinted to distinguish them from reality, unlike "Cheval Fou," and makes them less immediate.  The imagery is still shocking, though the impact is perhaps a bit softened due to the visual processing.  The boy, Fando, is astounding in his role and his demons are explored in a true surrealist fashion.  Frequently cutting to the creepy music (which is also in "Cheval Fou") and the Topor drawings, this film isn't subtle in it's discussion, choosing to hit the viewer over the head (moreso than Bunuel, even).  There is a bit less of a narrative focus here, using a "plot" only loosely to carry the ideas.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 August 2003<br />Careful<br />Guy Maddin, Canada, 1992<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Maddin is a very interesting, creative director who definitely has his own territory staked out though it's laden with references to past film - a sort of recombinatory originality perhaps?  This film I found hard to enjoy at the beginning though by the end I was more appreciative of it.  I certainly loved the art direction - the extremely soft look of old films, symbolic colors and beautiful shots of snow, etc.  However the actual direction - the way the actors spoke, the off-putting dubbed dialog- took a lot of getting used to and it wasn't something i felt comfortable with.  The story was an interesting deep Canadian/Bavarian look at Freudian psychodrama, and despite the exaggerated characters, there was a good deal of human emotion in it.  Of course, fairy tales are always heavy on the emotional.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 August 2003<br />Jubilee<br />Derek Jarman, UK, 1977<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I wish I could have seen this when I was in 8th grade and I was reading England's Dreaming and listening to the Sex Pistols.  This is a very important document of the punk movement in England, at least as filtered through Vivian Westwood, Jordan, and Derek Jarman's strange vision.  If forced to describe this movie to someone, I would probably say that it's the filmic version of Sam Delaney's "Dhalgren," only British.  The world where punk wins is mired in the excesses of the time, but the fear and terror of that time is certainly evident even despite the sillyness.  Given how this occurs on the verge of the right-wing revolution in Thatcherite Britain, it really makes the original punk obsession with Nazi Germany and fascism seem more terrible - though it's toned down in the movie.   Of course the characters are bogged down by the immature worldview of UK '77 punk, but Jarman puts in a pretty good effort, certainly showing that he was more than just a mindless follower.  I could probably write more about this film, but I'll keep this semi-short.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 August 2003<br />All the Real Girls<br />David Gordon Green, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this film.  David Gordon Green definitely established himself as a real talent with George Washington, and he took a more normal, almost adolescent topic here and dissected it in a similar way.  While lacking the southern rural mysticism of GW, this film strikes an emotional note, especially with me given the current state of my personal life.  While every frame was breathtakingly beautiful, this came off as a bit less of Terence Malick-worship and more of a unique identity.  And while I am surprised he chose a plot like this, the film advances through the story in a way that made me really put down all of my artistic pretenses and empathize with the characters.  The really amazing thing about this film was that acting, though - the dialog between Paul and Noel is so incredibly real, honest, awkward, genuine - that I can't even imagine how they went from a script.  While at times the narrative reminded me of early Hal Hartley movies, this really stood out as a fantastic sophmore effort.  I wonder how his "Confederacy of Dunces" will turn out - with him trying a comic hand.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 August 2003<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: Pete's<br />Format: <br />Company: Pete, Ange<br />What comments can I possibly leave about this film after I have watched it 15 times?  Note: pete and ange are now fully my friends.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 August 2003<br />Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, Le<br />Luis Bu&#241;uel, France / Italy / Spain, 1972<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Jocelyn Horner<br />Watching this for the first time in awhile, it's still totally great and funny but I realize just how much the actor's mannerisms amuse me, like Senechal's cool arrogance and the daffy lady's vacant expressions.  Like many other comedies I love, the characters' excesses just get better with time. I was having trouble staying awake though cause we watched it at 3 AM.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 September 2003<br />Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br />Michael Ian Black / Michael Showalter / David Wain, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Jocelyn<br />Well, Jocelyn passed the litmus test of "enjoying Stella".  <br /><br /><br /><br />7 September 2003<br />Vall&#233;e, La<br />Barbet Schroeder, France, 1972<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A remarkable artifact of it's era - in some ways this is the most "hippie" of all movies.  The Pink Floyd soundtrack notwithstanding, this is a fascinating insight into the attitudes of the fringest of cultures from this period.  And while the film seemd immature and awkwardly dialogued in this way, Nestor Alamendros' cinematography was a compelling reason for me to stay with it.  Perhaps this is a more subdued take on The Holy Mountain - this would have been a perfect film to watch when we talked about "the other" in my postmodern art class a few years back.  The pulse of excitement that goes through the end of this movie is like a Herzog film, but I can't imagine how I would have enjoyed it more had Popul Vuh or Brainticket done the soundtrack instead.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 September 2003<br />Cremaster 5<br />Matthew Barney, USA, 1997<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Done in the style of an opera, this wasn't nearly as much fun to sit through as #4.  Of course there were some redeemable elements and the cinematography was beautiful, but I can't hang with the opera thing.  It was hard for me to avoid comparing it to "Baby of Macon," just in terms of the baroqueness.  After watching this I decided not to sit through #1 and #2 until another night.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 September 2003<br />Cremaster 4<br />Matthew Barney, USA / France / UK, 1995<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />The more I thought about this after the fact the more I enjoyed it; of course the creepy psychosexual elements are always fun, but the pure strangeness of it was captivating enough to make me get through it.  It was very well edited and had a low budget feel to it.  There isn't much here breaking ground beyond surrealism, but hey, what would you do if you were trying to make an experimental film in the mid 90's?<br /><br /><br /><br />23 September 2003<br />Cremaster 1<br />Matthew Barney, USA, 1996<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian, Pete, Ange<br />Like the feminine counterpart to 4, 1 succeeds because it's filmed in the Boise State stadium on blue turf and uses the Goodyear blimps to it's advantage.  Of course it was totally fucking long, with 40 minutes feeling like three hours, and I kept looking at my watch to see when it would be over.  The creepy sexuality is in full effect here, laden with tension and kitchiness as well.  <br /><br /><br /><br />23 September 2003<br />Cremaster 2<br />Matthew Barney, USA, 1999<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian, Pete, Ange<br />Cremaster 2 is a spectacular work that was the most beautiful and dark one to look at it; at the same time, it's the most inpenetrable at first glance.  After seeing it, it really isn't that inpenetrable but when I was watching it I felt totally lost.  There are lots of ideas here, and this is really a first-rate experimental film - and casting Norman Mailer is fucking brilliant.  This has me very anxious to see 3!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />30 September 2003<br />Cremaster 3<br />Matthew Barney, USA, 2002<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: Pete, Adam, etc.<br />After finishing the cycle I am rather drained.  This was an incredible experience, even though all of these films are somewhat flawed; they are still remarkable.  I will probably always think of Cremaster when I think of this turbulent time in my life.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 October 2003<br />Goodfellas<br />Martin Scorsese, USA, 1990<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />The article in the Believer made me want to see this; I expected some heavy shit like the Godfather but it was actually a lot more lighthearted, so casual in it's violence that it almost became cartoonish.  Watching DeNiro in anything is always a pleasure, and I always enjoy depictions of Italian-American culture.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 October 2003<br />Secretary<br />Steven Shainberg, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I dug this for it's creepyness - especially James Spader, who was amazingly creepy - until the end, when I felt it went into a too typical romantic ending. But then thinking about it later, I realized that's the beauty of it - that it has a happy ending, and doesn't have any type of moralizing or negative consequences to 'dark' behavior - showing that people with bizarre fetishes can live together happily.  Which is somewhat commendable.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 October 2003<br />Analyze This<br />Harold Ramis, USA / Australia, 1999<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Sat on the couch and watched this during my "sick" day.  Not particularly funny - both Crystal and Deniro have been far better, and some of the jokes were just pathetic.  I expect better from Harold Ramis, though he will probably never beat "Groundhog Day".  I really just watched this so I could watch the sequel with Brian.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 October 2003<br />Bijit&#226; Q<br />Takashi Miike, Japan, 2001<br />Location: Brian's<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />On the surface, this was one of the most fucked up films I have ever seen, and the dogma/verite style only added to it.  Underneath, this was a really delving look at paternity, love, violence, and voyeurism.  The father figure, feeling the typical masculine weakness about his son being bullied, resorts to a documenting his son's downfall and his own attempted heroism.  In a sense, it's like that Levitra commercial about throwing the football through the tire swing.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 October 2003<br />Analyze That<br />Harold Ramis, USA / Australia, 2002<br />Location: Brian's<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />We watched this because his mom inexplicably bought it for him, and we thought it would be funny.  Boy, this was horrible.  There serious was nothing good about it.  The funniest joke was in the first 10 minutes and the rest of it was utter hell to sit through.  Usually I can enjoy a bad movie but this had nothing redeemable.  I didn't think Deniro and Crystal could get any worse than the first one, but they do.  Brian and I slugged it out though.  Watching these back to back over two days was more intense than I bargained for.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 October 2003<br />The Independent<br />Stephen Kessler, USA, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A big disappointment, considering how long I wanted to see this.  Not that it was terrible, but it wasn't nearly as funny as it looked.  It gets bonus points for having a handful of Mr. Show actors, and for being shot in a very low budget manner itself, but this has basically no re-viewing value.  <br /><br /><br /><br />13 October 2003<br />Koroshiya 1<br />Takashi Miike, Japan / Hong Kong / South Korea, 2001<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />While definitely a study on violence, this had less subtext than Visitor Q and was just about as entertaining. Due to the excellent acting, I really felt that Ichi despised killing, even as he sliced open a whore's throat.  The violence in this film was practically cartoonish, though still horrifying, and the art direction and editing was really slick and entertaining.  The character of Kakihara was fantastic - maybe they will make a prequel with him in it?  I think I'm gonna start dressing like Kakihara.  Or Ichi.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 October 2003<br />Gummo<br />Harmony Korine, USA, 1997<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />As much as I wanted to hate it, I really enjoyed it.  I guess I was surprised at how artistic it was.  The white trash shock value stuff neither shocked nor amused me; I guess I enjoyed this because of the performances he coaxed out of these people, most of whom were not actors.  Cousin Ira was incredible - the scene with him lifting weights while his mother tapdances (actually any scene with him and his mother, like the hairwashing scene) was full of unrecognized drama, tension, and weird bursts of nostalgia.  I don't think it's as good of a film as George Washington but it's definitely mining the same territory though with more of an Altman influence than I thought it would.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 October 2003<br />A Zed &#38; Two Noughts<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands, 1985<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Lisa<br />It was nice watching this with Lisa.  I'm getting psyched/re-obsessed for the Greenaway DVD's, which should ship to me in just a few days!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />18 October 2003<br />Hafi&#240;<br />Baltasar Korm&#225;kur, Iceland / France / Norway, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I wasn't blown away by this, but I enjoyed it certainly more than 101 Reykavik.  It had a strange John Sayles feel to it, though maybe I just think that because it was about the fishing industry in a small town (like "Limbo").  Actually it's easily described as The Celebration crossed with The House of Yes with maybe some ideas from the Corrections thrown in.  And Iceland is always interesting, interesting enough to keep my interest in a movie that would have failed were it American.  This also felt so much like an obvious "mature" second effort, at least compared to Reykavik.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 October 2003<br />The Hills Have Eyes<br />Wes Craven, USA, 1977<br />Location: Pete's<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian, Pete, Ange<br />I expected this to be really intense and good, because it sounded like it would be and Doug is really into it.  Instead I found a really mediocre slasher film with nothing remarkable about it except for Michael Berryman looking creepy.  This had a real "Manos, The Hands of Fate" feel to it, and would have been painful to sit through alone.  There was some definite edgyness to it, but I didn't even really find the situation to be that original, and the only effective moments were due to the editing being so bad and confusing.  It was fun to crack jokes during this movie.  Great title, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 October 2003<br />Buffet froid<br />Bertrand Blier, France, 1979<br />Location: Heather's<br />Format: <br />Company: Ang, Pete, Heather, Tim<br />Watching this again was great, though Heather's apartment was so hot I was falling asleep and my feet were itching.  I realized what a homage to Bunuel this film is, even down to the lack of a musical score.  The way shots will be repeated to confuse the viewer as to whether or not they are watching a dream is straight out of Discreet Charm.  There's more obvious humour here, even down to visual gags like the weapons, etc.  <br /><br /><br /><br />25 October 2003<br />Katakuri-ke no k&#244;fuku<br />Takashi Miike, Japan, 2001<br />Location: Stettinius Tavern<br />Format: <br />Company: Spencer<br />This made me think "If this film was American, would I hate it?"  Probably.  Because there's a certain novelty to off-the-wall Japanese stuff that doesn't really translate to off-the-wall American stuff.  I mean, if Charlie Kaufmann wrote this it would be just like "Human Nature" and I'd hate it.  But it's pretty damn funny, and the art direction was great, and actually the cast acted really well.  It's nice to see a Miike film that is only slightly fucked up, and not really violent at all.  And it's gonna be a great one to watch with other people.  Also Spencer asked the question "What does Miike really bring to cinema that is new?"  Also I tried to think of an American parallel to him, and I thought of a combination of Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 October 2003<br />Don't Look Now<br />Nicolas Roeg, Italy / UK, 1973<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Lisa<br />This film looks great on DVD.  The parts where the rain hits the pond are dazzling, and shows how Roeg can create a hallucinatory effect even in more understated moments.  Lisa didn't enjoy this, which shocked me because I think it's such an incredible film.  I am embarassed that I actually found this scary the first time I saw it.  What was I thinking?  The third time it was just funny.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 October 2003<br />Schizopolis<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 1996<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I really liked this!  Some of the humour really failed, as it embraced the worst CMU-type "zany madcap" stuff.  But for the most part this felt like a film adaptation of a Mark Leyner novel, but which actually worked.  And surprisingly, Soderbergh is a great actor and I wish he was in more stuff.  And I actually got a weird "Putney Swope" vibe from it, in the sense that it's totally selfaware that it's a movie and just tries to be ridiculous.  And it's as much of a document of it's time period as PS, maybe even more so because I felt like I was reading suck.com at times.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 October 2003<br />Traffic<br />Steven Soderbergh, Germany / USA, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I feel like I am understanding Soderbergh now, for as crappy as "The Limey" was, "Traffic" and "Schizopolis" more than make up for it.  This is a great ensemble film that remained intelligent throughout; and it presented a well-rounded, yet critical view of the drug war while still being entertaining.  The handheld camerawork was perfect and not overdone; the tinting was also just right, without making the film feel overstylized.  There was a really great cast here and even weak links like Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones performed well under Soderbergh's direction.  Soderbergh seems to have the ability to take what would be a horrible Hollywood film and make it actually good.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 October 2003<br />28 Days Later...<br />Danny Boyle, UK, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I didn't even think about it, but it was a good film to watch on Halloween alone in my dark living room.  A grand entertainment that was true to the spirit of great zombie movies, yet infused with a hip, trendy element.  The violence was great - nothing spectacular except the main guy pushing his thumbs into the guy's eye sockets is like right out of Ichi the Killer.  A shade of "The Quiet Earth" and a great debt to "Dawn of the Dead" of course.  It was also interesting how the black female was the aggressive leader at the beginning, but as the movie progressed she seemed to reveal feminine weaknesses and retreat into her "role" in a horror movie.  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 November 2003<br />Elf<br />Jon Favreau, USA, 2003<br />Location: Robinson Town Center<br />Format: <br />Company: Al Hoff<br />This was a magical holiday masterpiece, heartwarming and pure, and by the end I was even convinced of Santa Claus' existence.  No, wait, that's "Miracle on 34th Street" I'm thinking about -- this was a utter load of steaming horseshit, without any deviation from formula.  There weren't even any clever jokes for adults wedged in.  It did feature both Big Fat Bernie Gale and LaFleur, however.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 November 2003<br />Lost in Translation<br />Sofia Coppola, USA / Japan, 2003<br />Location: Denis<br />Format: <br />Company: Mom, Dad, Lisa<br />I went into this expecting an all-out laughfest like Rushmore, for the poster made me think it was going to be a Bill Murray comedic vehicle.  Instead, I'm treated to probably the strongst acting of his career, and Scarlet Johansson is also superb.  Coppola sets this up like an Altman film - with a very loose script, or at least it felt loose, with low dialogue and lots of facial expressions.  The obvious parallels to my forthcoming life (re: being in Japan with nothing to do) also hit me rather hard.  Highly recommended.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 November 2003<br />Katakuri-ke no k&#244;fuku<br />Takashi Miike, Japan, 2001<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Mcdowell, Brian, Alicia<br />Very fun the second time, especially while consuming excessive quantities of beer.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 November 2003<br />Chopper<br />Andrew Dominik, Australia, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I was very impressed with Eric Bana - he carried this movie with lots of humour and a remarkable portrayal of the real life Chopper (as the DVD special features showed).  I didn't think this was amazing, though it was well-done, and offered a good look into seedy Australian culture.  I'm not going to run out and see the Hulk but he really was fantastic in this.  And it was funny enough to keep my interest.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2003<br />Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself<br />Lone Scherfig, Denmark / UK / Sweden / France, 2002<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />A good film that I expected to be a "dark comedy"; while it was definitely bleak, there are only some funny parts (though they are actually very funny) in the first half before the movie shifts to an overwrought tearjerker.  But it's done very well, and the quirks of the characters push the story along so it never gets boring.  The scenes of Glasgow were nice, and served to hammer in the extreme poverty of these characters.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2003<br />Dead or Alive: Hanzaisha<br />Takashi Miike, Japan, 1999<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />Not nearly up to par with the other Miike stuff I've seen, this was nonetheless pretty fun, even though I had trouble following the story.  The first five minutes were dazzling and the ending was ludicrous in a good way.  The middle dragged a bit, though the scene where a girl drowns in shit was quite memorable.  I'll still rent Dead or Alive 2 and 3 when they come in.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2003<br />Horns and Halos<br />Michael Galinsky / Suki Hawley, USA, 2002<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A low-budget, somewhat punk rock documentary about the "Fortunate Son" book that actually was pretty well done.  It was surprisingly fair to both sides of the controversy, showing how fucked up the publisher/author are and not avoiding their weaknesses.  Shot on camcorder, this was probably most fascinating because it showed how seat-of-the-pants Soft Skull Press was.  <br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2003<br />Solaris<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />It's hard to not compare Soderbergh's "Solaris" to Tarkovsky, even though it's supposed to be a remake of the Lem novel, not the film.  But there were definite shots that were homages to Tarkovsky, most notably the water on the window near the end.  Soderbergh's take isn't really as different as I expected it to be.  Though almost an hour shorter than Tarkovsky's, it actually feels slower.   I expected this to be a action-packed sci-fi movie, but SS kept it very cerebral and arty.  Clooney is okay, probably better than anything else I have seen him in (though that's not saying much) but I really hated the other guy in this movie.  This probably comes up as the least interesting of the three remakes I've watched this weekend (though I never saw the original 'Quiet American').<br /><br /><br /><br />9 November 2003<br />The Singing Detective<br />Keith Gordon, USA, 2003<br />Location: Regent Sq.<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I went in expecting to hate this, but I actually found it very well done.  I just watched the original series last month, so I was somewhat excited to see how Americans would screw it up.  And they didn't really screw it up too bad, but of course Dennis Potter did write the script - which was almost exactly the same as the BBC series, with a few American references thrust in.  I don't know why they bothered changing Marlow's name, but then leaving everything else exactly the same.  Mel Gibson was astounding - I didn't even recognize him - and it was nice to see the one thug from the Coen brothers movies.  But the main question nagging me with this film is: Why bother to remake something that is already perfect? Why try to compress a 7 hour mini series into 109 minutes?  What did Keith Gordon want to do here?  Simply make a homage to a series that he loved?  Maybe I enjoyed this because it made me think so much about the original series.  I guess we are inspired by art that we love, and a remake is a way to make something we love more personal.  But it's such a fine line to cross, because it's so hard to do it successfully; one can merely duplicate something, or one can really give it their own mark.  I certainly understand remaking films that are in a foreign language or really old, because you can introduce something to a new audience.  But this was neither foreign-language nor old.  But maybe I shouldn't view this as a remake, but a film adaptation of a television miniseries.  That's really what it is, yet I cannot help by think of it as a bastardized American remake (although a good one).  As good as Robert Downey Jr. is, he's  no Michael Gambon.  But this remake did hit some of the key scenes in the original, such as the word association game between Gibbon and Marlow, and the ending "At Swim Two Birds" part.  The chemistry between Gibbon and Marlow, which was one of my favorite parts of the original, was accurately captured.  But so many storylines and subplots were excised in the name of time, that it almost reduces the whole thing to "The Singing Detective for Dummies".  The shortening of the story also quickens Marlow's recovery, and it loses some of the impact.  I guess I would only recommend this to people who have seen the series already, because the thought of someone only watching this and feeling like they've got the whole experience saddens me.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 November 2003<br />The Quiet American<br />Phillip Noyce, Germany / USA / UK / Australia / France, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Rented on Mrs. Sweetapple's recommendation, this was a very intelligent, moving drama. I was never totally thrilled by it, but I can't say anything bad about it; even Brendan Fraser was good.  The political undercurrent was very much to my liking, and I especially liked how the film raised the question about when killing is justified - if it can stop future atrocities, etc. - or even if they can be stopped. Graham Greene novels make good movies I guess.  This is the third remake I have watched in two days.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 November 2003<br />Blue Vinyl<br />Daniel B. Gold / Judith Helfand, , 2002<br />Location: Harris<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A documentary about the evil environmental hazard that vinyl is, "Blue Vinyl" had the potential to be awful, self-indulgent and annoying, but it turned out to be quite accomplished.  A very personal documentary, it actually presented a lot of information and made it's points in an intelligent way.  Judith Helfand is like a less obnoxious Michael Moore, and I got used to her annoying voice after about fifteen minutes and enjoyed the film quite a bit.  The animation sequences were very well done and there was enough entertainment that it didn't get too dry.  I also realized how the "personal documentary" is basically a license to make the most biased films imaginable.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 November 2003<br />Stone Reader<br />Mark Moskowitz, USA, 2002<br />Location: Regent Sq.<br />Format: <br />Company: Doug Stewart<br />Wow.  This is probably my favorite film of the year, because it spoke to me so much.  Mark Moskowitz is a lifelong reader, who really loves literature; his search for Dow Mossman mirrors the many times I have tried to find out information about an obscure book or music artist (Milkbottle H, anyone)?  And the film is done in such a fantastic personal style - very remniscent of Ross McElwee, of course, but with a very peaceful confidence.  Some critics may think the scenes of Moskowitz raking leaves or cleaning his pool are superfluous, but to me they spoke of the calmer approaches of middle-class life, like NIcholson Baker's latest novel.  And the joy of reading is the undercurrent throughout this film - the experiences we base our lives around, the way books make a difference.  Moskowitz's anecdote about discovering Catch 22 as a boy is heartwarming, and he wisely uses footage of his own son exploring an amusement park.  There's nothing tricky, clever, avant-garde or innovative about this film (and it's brief attempts at self-referentiality are mere distractions) but that is perhaps why it succeeds so much.  When I interviewed for Dalkey Archive, i felt like there was a whole literary culture that I was just discovering, linked by a passion for reading.  This film is an exploration of that culture, and it was incredible to experience.  The scene where Moskowitz films his own bookshelves, talking about his organization system, is not just self-indulgence - it is my life!  My life and his life and Dow Mossman's life, and the book crtiic in Maine and all of the people in this film who I just want to talk to in real life.  As exciting as it was to hear references to Joseph McElroy in a movie theater, it was first and foremost a film about Mark Moskowitz, and me, and Andy, and everyone else who is moved by books.  If I am living like Moskowitz when I am his age, then I am no longer scared about the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 November 2003<br />Ratcatcher<br />Lynne Ramsay, UK / France, 1999<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />stunning, lyrical scottish film<br /><br /><br /><br />13 November 2003<br />8 femmes<br />Fran&#231;ois Ozon, France / Italy, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I remembered this film because Bob Burns recommended it last year when it played here, so I rented it.  Big mistake.  This was a classic murder mystery full of embarassing revelations and dumb plot twists, all structured around 8 of the finest French actresses working together.  Although I think I am in love with Ludivine Sagnier now, this film was actually hard to finish watching.  Did I mention it was a musical, but not in a clever ironic way like Miike would do?  Totally campy, and structured around lively colors, I still thought it sucked.  <br /><br /><br /><br />13 November 2003<br />Valseuses, Les<br />Bertrand Blier, France, 1974<br />Location: work<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />I finally get around to renting another Betrand Blier film, and I am not disappointed!  This wasn't as absurd as "Buffet Froid" but a lot more fucked up.  Gerard Depardieu and his friend just go throughout the movie being the biggest assholes ever without any real plot, conflict or resolution, and you know what?  It's hilarious.  Violence, stupidity and misogyny in that very very black European way.  Totally fun and genuinely funny, if you have a peverse sense of humour.  It's not quite as perverse as Visitor Q, but it's pretty close for it's time.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 November 2003<br />The Burning Wall<br />Hava Kohav Beller, USA, 2002<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: Lisa, Brian<br />This was like watching the history channel for two hours - an interesting history of East Germany, but I was led to believe that it would focus more on the surveillance techniques of the secret police, etc.  Perhaps the film festival's writeup was misleading, or perhaps I didn't read it enough.  It was very well done, yet dry, and I found it interesting how noted East German activist Robert Havemann was tapping some really young ass.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 November 2003<br />Owning Mahowny<br />Richard Kwietniowski, Canada / UK, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Daron Gardner was superb in this film, a low-key tale of gambling addiction.  It was depressing, but not as depressing as I thought; the story was fairly interesting, but it was really Daron's performance in the lead role which kept me so interested.   Many of the other characters were cheesy, exaggerated and far from, er, exemplary;; but Daron's subtlety was captivating.  The second best film about gambling addiction I have ever seen!<br /><br /><br /><br />16 November 2003<br />Intolerable Cruelty<br />Joel Coen / Ethan Coen, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Pete<br />Very funny; though not one of the Coen brother's best, I was continually laughing from the silly characters and dumb jokes.  George Clooney and Catherine Z-J are completely awful, though I  might even admit Clooney is growing on me (or maybe it's just cause I've seen him so much I'm used to him, like an annoying uncle).  Wheezy Jones was great, and even the overdone Baron character was funny because it was so completely ridiculous.  Great entertainment if not great art.  I bet the cinematography would look great if it wasn't a bootleg copy I got from the Internet.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 November 2003<br />Melvin Goes to Dinner<br />Bob Odenkirk, USA, 2003<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: <br />Company: none and many<br />Bob Odenkirk directed this take on "My Dinner with Andre" that focuses around a dinner conversation; the dialogue is everything and it's extremely well-written, as natural as anything I've ever seen.  The main actor/writer is a very honest spokesperson and the interests and obsessions of the characters touch down on my mid-twenties personality crisis with a pretty astounding resonance.  It's funny at times, and would be even without the cameos by Jack Black/David Cross/et al; but it's that subtle type of humour, like Melvin saying "Dude" with just the right inflection - it's that natural humour in people's personalities that is nailed dead-on here that I liked best.  The plot twists at the end seemed a bit unnecessary, though it was put together very well; the conversations alone could have carried the film.  Filmmakers just projected a DVD; way to go, dickheads.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 November 2003<br />Hugo Pool<br />Robert Downey Sr., USA, 1997<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />Out of boredom I've decided to catch up on all of the shitty Blockbuter Outlet videos I've accumulated over the past few years.  I started with this, a recent Robert Downey Sr. movie, and I was surprised.  There are many elements of the oddball, Putney Swope style of humour present in this movie - far more than you'd imagine.  Robert Downey Jr. and Malcolm McDowell are so ridiculous in their roles that it makes the film at least continually amusing - to the point where you can overlook the horrible performances by Alyssa Milano and just about everyone else.  But despite these goofy elements, the film still plays by the rules too much.  Of course a lot has changed in 30 years, and I can't expect him to make a Putney Swope again. So if you're a huge Downey fan it's definitely worth seeing - B movies have been a lot worse.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 November 2003<br />Captain Ron<br />Thom Eberhardt, USA, 1992<br />Location: Miracles<br />Format: <br />Company: lots<br />Captain Ron isn't really that bad either.  Okay, I know this doesn't sound believable, but as these types of films go, it's okay.  Kurt is pretty ridiculous, and I've always liked Martin Short, and plus I was drinking a lot, and every time I had a beer I had to put a Kurt sticker on (Weisel printed 3,000 of them).  <br /><br /><br /><br />21 November 2003<br />Overboard<br />Garry Marshall, USA, 1987<br />Location: Miracles<br />Format: <br />Company: Sam, Linnea, Weisel<br />To kick off Kurtober Fest 2003, I watched this movie.  My mom loves this movie and I have seen it many times, and always regarded it as a bad movie.  But here, I loved it.  Of course, any shitty film becomes better when watching it with other people, especially when they're obsessed with Kurt Russell.  Kurt is great here - his hair is really big, and there's a slightly misogynist bent to the first half that is amusing if nothing else.  Goldie Hawn is really good too - I wonder if this film is what spurned their long romance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />21 November 2003<br />The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes<br />Robert Butler, USA, 1969<br />Location: Miracles<br />Format: <br />Company: lots<br />This was the only other film at Kurtober that I saw in it's entirety over the two days, so I will list it, though by this point the night was pretty hazy and I can't remember it much.  Kurt is very young here - a teenager, really - and this part at the end where he acts retarded is great.  Shiflet also pointed out how all of the graphic design in this film looks like a Stereolab record.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 November 2003<br />Drowning by Numbers<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands, 1988<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Lisa<br />A masterpiece.  One of my favorite Greenaways because it's the most playful, and most human.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 November 2003<br />The Backyard<br />Paul Hough, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Brian<br />At first, this was hilarious.  By the end I was horrified.  This didn't seem like the most well-made documentary, but the subject matter was fucked up enough that it was entertaining.  I wouldn't recommend that anyone rush out to see this, unless you are really into seeing teenagers smashing each other with bricks and barbed wire.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 November 2003<br />Day of the Dead<br />George A. Romero, USA, 1985<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />For some reason I had never seen this before, and I borrowed it from Bolam last summer and never got around to watching it.  What better way to spend a Friday night alone than watching this?  You get bad 80's synth-suspense music, terrible acting, a ridiculously caricatured Jamaican, and most importantly you get zombies eating people.  The non-zombie scenes became pretty painful, mostly due to the acting, but Romero is good at turning on the action right when you start to get bored.  The military/mutiny angle was remarkable similar to 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002) but without any attempted rape.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 December 2003<br />The Bad News Bears<br />Michael Ritchie, USA, 1976<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />When my father passes away (hopefully not for a long time), I am blessed in that I will always be able to rent Walter Matthau movies to remember him by.  I'm not sure if I like Walter Matthau so much just because he reminds me of my father, or because he is a great comic actor.  Either way, he kept my interest in this film which I have not seen since I was nine years old or so (when the alcoholism theme was certainly lost on me).  And being that my own father was an alcoholic until I was ten, there's a special connection there.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 December 2003<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: Bolam<br />I still don't get tired of watching this.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2003<br />Salon Kitty<br />Tinto Brass, Italy / West Germany / France, 1976<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />There's a website out there made by this Tinto Brass fanatic, who asserts that Tinto Brass is one of the greatest geniuses of cinema to ever live, yet his work is unrecognized because of his often vulgar subject matter.  I don't know if I would go quite that far, but it's certainly somewhat true.  Being very familiar with his less serious, more, um, recent work, this film (which was placed midway between his avant-garde and erotic periods) is incredibly unique.  It's partly an exploitation film, like Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS with a bigger budget; yet partly a study in power and corruption.  The Nazi setting is certainly somewhat shocking, and the out-of-control sex and tasteless scenes gives you a really sleazy feeling when watching it.  But it's definitely remarkable how Brass strings everything together - it will go from a touching, romantic moment to a scene of intense cruelty in an eyeblink - and then maybe to some poignant social commentary, or a music number.  It's strung together in a less than convincing manner, but I think I am starting to realize what a unique language Brass has with the camera.  Besides the fact that he basically remade the sex part of this film as Paprika (1989), his cuts and camera movements are evident throughout his later work.  Yet while there is tons of sex in this movie, it was rarely tittilating - it was often used for comedic effect, or to just be twisted.  It's interesting how he has turned his back on serious filmmaking (for the most part, though Senso 45 seems like a bit of a return to form) when he was capable of scoring funding for projects as extreme as this.  I'm even more fascinated by Brass, and I hope that someday his more radical films (like Nerosubianco) are available.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2003<br />Breaking Away<br />Peter Yates, USA, 1979<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />This is a fantastic coming of age movie that I wish I would have seen when I was younger, for there would be some nostalgia to attach to it.  At age 23, it's not really that effective, though it's still a good portrait of Midwestern life.  It reminded me of "Return of the Secacus 7" for some weird reason, though perhaps it's just because they were both low-budget films about working class people made at approximately the same time.  I can see why Lloyd and Paul are into this film, and it's nice that the Cutters win in this movie since they can't win at miniature golf.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 December 2003<br />The Horse's Mouth<br />Ronald Neame, UK, 1958<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A very lighthearted comedy (which still manages to portray the artistic temprement well) that is all about Alec Guiness.  He creates a marvelous character here, and it's funnier that I expected.  Like "Hopscotch" (the only other Ronald Neame film I have seen), it's such a well-written story that as conventional as it is, it's entertaining - and "family" entertainment at that.  I don't think I've ever actually seen Alec Guiness before, and I am interested now.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 December 2003<br />S&#229;nger fr&#229;n andra v&#229;ningen<br />Roy Andersson, Sweden / Norway / Denmark, 2000<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />A very strange, beautiful film that was somehow a comedy despite being mostly plotless.  I found moments of black humour in many of the characters expressions, or the pauses between dialog - and the static shots certainly added to the tension.  I didn't really understand this film completely, yet I found it engrossing in a very calm way (and the music MADE the film).  I'd recommend this to someone like Adam Strohm, but not to someone like Andy Beckerman.  It was very Swedish.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 December 2003<br />The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring<br />Peter Jackson, New Zealand / USA, 2001<br />Location: Brian's<br />Format: <br />Company: Bolam, Brian, Lisa<br />Watching all three of these movies in a row was pretty insane.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It was almost eleven hours of Lord of the Rings, and I can only think how much better it will be when the extended RotK comes out.  This time I planned to nap during Fellowship, but I wound up engrossed by it as if I had seen it for the first time.  When Bolam came we had fun making jokes nonstop.  I got the idea to do a LotR "remix" too.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 December 2003<br />The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers<br />Peter Jackson, USA / New Zealand / Germany, 2002<br />Location: Brian's<br />Format: <br />Company: Bolam, Brian, Lisa<br />Two Towers looks good extended.  The scene with Dadamir yelling at Faramir is pretty intense and gives a little more insight into his character.  Also, Merry and Pippin were fucking stoned as hell in that one scene.  We had to fast forward through the last 15 minutes because we didn't have time, but I'm still listing it.  I also realized that the Vietnam war was sort of like Helm's Deep for the Viet Cong.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 December 2003<br />The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King<br />Peter Jackson, USA / New Zealand / Germany, 2003<br />Location: Loew's Waterfront<br />Format: <br />Company: Bolam, Brian, many more<br />I was waiting a year for this, and it did not disappoint.  I decided that I wasn't going to hold the many inaccuracies from the book against it, for as Bolam said, "The book still exists" and that's a pretty good point.  Besides, it's been about a year since I read RotK and I can barely remember it.  This film was incredibly overwhelming.  Seeing it at midnight was pretty intense, and I didn't get home until 4 and didn't go to sleep untl 5.  I don't know if I should make this a really long review talking about all of the cool stuff or just leave it like this.  I guess I'll shut up.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 December 2003<br />Jam&#243;n, jam&#243;n<br />Bigas Luna, Spain, 1992<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />This was your typical boy-meets-girl, boy-impregnates-girl, boy's-mom-hires-guy-to-sleep-with-girl, girl-falls-in-love-with-other-guy, boy's-mom-falls-in-love-with-other-guy-too, boy-sleeps-with-girls-mom, girl-sleeps-with-boy's-dad, other-guy-clubs-boy-to-death-with-piece-of-meat story,  I always thought Bigas Lunas would be a lot goofier and dreamier (though there was a dream sequence in here that was straight out of Viva La Muerte) but I was disappointed.  Still there was an attempt to be artsy with certain objects, like pearls and olives and garlic.  <br /><br /><br /><br />17 December 2003<br />Miracle Mile<br />Steve De Jarnatt, USA, 1988<br />Location: home<br />Format: <br />Company: none<br />In my quest to clean out the juky videos I've accumulated from Blockbuster, I have finally watched this one, which I bought on Jon Wichmann's recommendation.  It's a film about the end of the world that has no idea which genre to belong in; it switches between thin romance, urban crime drama, action-packed thriller and psychological horror every few minutes without ever establishing it's own identity.  But what can we expect from a film stuffed with actors this bland?  Anthony Edwards is awkward and unlikeable in the hero role, and Mare Winningham is hardly a thrilling leading lady.  But no actor could save this script, a hole-ridden mess that would maybe have worked as a late 60's counterculture/paranoia film.  I'm not one to fuss about plausibility, especially in this type of movie, but the story here isn't even pleasantly implausible - it just obviously does what is convienent for the story to move along.  The 1980'sness of the film is actually one of the few positive things I can say - it's a cheesy reminder of what late 80's B-movies were like.  Also there's a completely lackluster Tangerine Dream soundtrack. The writer/director of this - who actually cowrote Strange Brew! - never directed another picture, and it's easy to see why.  I could see him working through the system for years just waiting for the chance to make this film, and some naieve studio taking him up on the offer, only to be met with failure.  The scenes of rioting at the end of the film are really the only redeeming thing about it.  Is this film really a heartfelt yearning for nuclear disarmament?  Or just a Roger Corman-like attempt to cash in on Cold War paranoia?  I don't think the writer knew either.  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2004<br />Withnail &#38; I<br />Bruce Robinson, UK, 1987<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: Caleb, Lisa, Rachelle, Bryan, Pete, Ken<br />Watching this with Caleb while drinking is a tradition of ours, and we realized that his visit was almost over before we had a chance.  Having other people there definitely affected the comradarie, but not as much as the excessive amounts of gin I drank.  I had intended to observe the differences between the British and American assholes-who-get-fucked-up buddy movie, but I was unable to really concentrate on it, because right at the part where Withnail tells the farmer that they went on holiday by mistake, I got totally drunk all at once.  The room started spinning and I felt like shit.  I don't really remember much else.  At one point I went to the bathroom and fell asleep on the toilet, and Lisa found me sitting there with my pants down like a fool.  I tried to pass out in my room and throw up in the kitchen sink without anyone noticing, but I'm sure I failed and everyone thinks I'm a total fucking idiot now.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2004<br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<br />Terry Gilliam, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: Kyle, Andy, Caleb<br />Why have I never seen this film before?  I liked the book when I read it in high school and I like Terry Gilliam; yet for some reason I never saw this before.  Which is too bad, because I loved it this time around and can only think how I would have enjoyed it maybe even more at earlier times in my life. Though it's hard not to imagine Depp's Hunter S. as a Pat Clark gone nasty.  <br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2004<br />Melvin Goes to Dinner<br />Bob Odenkirk, USA, 2003<br />Location: Pete's<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: Pete, Ken, Heather White (for part)<br />I rarely watch movies more than once unless they are things like Withnail, Bottle Rocket, Safe Men, etc.  I never expected to see this again, especially less than two months after seeing it the first time, but Pete wanted to see it (according to DVDean) and it fit the mood I was in.  And the second time through, I think I liked it even more!  I looked for clues about the crazy plot twist, since I knew what it was, and that was fun; and the nuances of the actors really charmed me.  I dunno if I'd take a third stab at it, but I have to say I do really, really enjoy this movie.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 January 2004<br />Morvern Callar<br />Lynne Ramsay, UK, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />Lynne Ramsay's second feature breaks away from the moody, painterly qualities of Ratcatcher, working from a novelization and holding to a slightly more narrative picture.  There are still some incredibly beautiful moments, but overall it lacks the Terence Malickisms; there's a lot of digital processing or maybe footage shot straight onto video, which works in the scenes that are capturing the "youth gone wild" parties and whatnot, but takes away from some of the emotionalism of other scenes.  Some parts definitely had that "Kids" feel which I didn't care for, but after awhile the film really grabbed me. The scenes in Spain recalled the great tradition of spiritual, lyrical films.  I was reminded equally of Maya Deren and Jodorowsky, but without obvious homages to either; and the almost nonexistent dialogue let the scenery speak instead.  Like David Gordon Green's second film, it's not really a script or subject matter I find interesting, yet the films holds my attention anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 January 2004<br />Lost in La Mancha<br />Keith Fulton / Louis Pepe, UK / USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />This documentary was a lot straighter than I imagined - I thought Gilliam himself would have directed it, but it really looks like a "making of" for the eventual DVD that turned into the only salvageable material from this project.  As Adam said, it's a very frustrating thing to watch, but it's fascinating to watch how movies work.  I also realized just how much I dig Terry Gilliam.  The second disc features a conversation/interview between Gilliam and Salman Rushdie that is totally great - they seem like they would be fun guys to hang out with.  His "Good Omens" should be great! <br /><br /><br /><br />8 January 2004<br />Dom durakov<br />Andrei Konchalovsky, Russia / France, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />A very, very odd film - at first it seems like another insane people/war metaphor, but there was something even more surreal about it - the Bryan Adams thing was actually a major part of it, for instead of just being a quirky, postmodern element, it made this film really hard to get a grasp on.  As far as the story, it was amusing, but the caricatures of insane people were just too cartoonish - working in a building with insane people all day, I see a lot of them, and they aren't really that ridiculous - and the best moment of the film was probably the dialogue between the two opposing soldiers.  But it was paced well, and written in a way that made me want to keep watching even though I had to endure "Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman" about nine times.  Thumbs up, though, for the genuine weirdness factor.  Favorite theme: brotherhood.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 January 2004<br />Bad Santa<br />Terry Zwigoff, USA / Germany, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: Bootleg VCD, se<br />Company: McDowell<br />It's hard to say that this was disappointing, since I found myself laughing throughout it. But it's not great - it's barley even "good".   And I asked McDowell, "What could be done to make this better?"  The only thing we could think of would be to shorten it's length. It's an amusing premise but it can't sustain itself for more than a half hour.  Billy Bob Thornton is not great, though John Ritter manages to be pretty hilarious (though I thought he was Michael McKean at first when viewing on this crummy theater bootleg my brother got me).  Luckily the film avoids a really tender, heartfelt conclusion and pretty much keeps up the swearing and debauchery.   It wasn't particularly shocking, and it may have actually benefited from less swearing - only because saying "fuck" in front of little kids loses it's humour value pretty quickly.  I'll agree with Al in that the best thing was the setting (Phoenix) because of the inherent perversity of a Xmas movie set in the desert.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 January 2004<br />Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br />Michael Ian Black / Michael Showalter / David Wain, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC VHS, taped<br />Company: Adam, Weisel<br />Weisel laughed so hard throughout this that I thought he was going to die.  It's nice I can now make Stella jokes at Miracles.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 January 2004<br />Where the Buffalo Roam<br />Art Linson, USA, 1980<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: none<br />Bill Murray's portrayal of Hunter Thompson is a good one - maybe not as solid as Johnny Depp's, but he manages to bring his own style of humor to the role.  This is an interesting script, and I'm not entirely sure what it's aim was.  It's hard not to compare this to Gilliam's film, although the Las Vegas trip isn't in this film at all.  I don't know why they changed Oscar Acosta's name, but Peter Boyle is good and I'm glad they chose to focus on his activist side, especially the courtroom stuff.  And the most important themes of Thompson's work, regarding the decay of the 60's dream, the perversity of American culture, etc. are still present, though not quite as successfully due to less interesting art direction and a more fragmented narrative.  I'm not quite sure what was up with the ending, and Thompson's rejection of Acosta's dream - is this supposed to be some sort of rare moment of growth in Hunter S. Thompson?  Overall, the film lacked the sense of anarchy that Gilliam's has, which is a pretty vital component with these characters.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 January 2004<br />The Fisher King<br />Terry Gilliam, USA, 1991<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Brian<br />Continuin the Gilliam kick, I finally saw this film which I guess I've been meaning to see for about ten years.  Gilliam doesn't abandon his focus on those who dream against impossible odds, and it's as much of a fairy tale as his other films, though it's rooted in a very post-1980's New York urbanity, which doesn't bode well with his directorial style.  Robin Williams does well for once, with his flipped out humour kept in check; though I think I only really like Jeff Bridges when he's Lebowski.  As a buddy movie/romance it works well, though it seems Gilliam is sticking within the reins of Hollywood. I don't think Mercedes Ruehl deserved an oscar for this performance at all.  Nice Tom Waits cameo. Favorite theme: atonement.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 January 2004<br />David Cross: Let America Laugh<br />Lance Bangs / David Cross, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />David Cross's tour documentary struck me as a waste of a DVD, though I did find a few parts amusing.  For 90 minutes Cross whines and bitches about how shitty his audiences are, with the majority of the film seemingly dedicated to chronicling the morons who follow him around.  I don't really even know why I should get that excited about solo David Cross standup - he is funny but it's just standup comedy, and the magic of him and Bob is lost. (Though Bob's brief cameo proved to be the highlight of the film).  The sketch the documentary is nested in is not at all funny, and neither are any of the standup bits shown. Oh wait, they don't show any actual standup - just Cross fighting with the audience.  Lance Bangs seems like a good guy and everything, but I really didn't give a shit about this.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 January 2004<br />Punch-Drunk Love<br />Paul Thomas Anderson, USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />PT Anderson is not a director I am particularly impressed by, though I did enjoy "Magnolia" as I am an Altman fan.  Instead of ripping off Altman again, he takes a rather Coen Bros-y script and casts Adam Sandler in the role of his career.  The story was amusing and I found myself really enjoying it's strangeness, though some of the cartoonish elements in the art design and staging made things seems a little too "Hudsucker Proxy" for me.  But the film is sprinkled with great performances  - Anderson does know how to make mountains out of molehills - and thankfully it was brief.  It was easy to get dragged into the neuroses of Sandler's character, which was nice when juxtaposed against the vibrant colors.  Favorite theme: Honor.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 January 2004<br />Angst essen Seele auf<br />Rainer Werner Fassbinder, West Germany, 1974<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />This is the first Fassbinder film I have ever seen, and I definitely enjoyed it - I found it compelling enough despite the formally dry stylistic approach.  There were a lot of extended shots without any dialogue, and since I love the "poignant look" in film lately it was a thumbs-up.  Narratively it's a great look at racism, especially in post-war Germany - but I also liked how it was about old people, a subject not often dealt with in cinema.  And it was pessimistic as shit - I dunno if that is a characteristic of Fassbinder - yet it's bleakness was cushioned in a pseudo-happy ending.  I want to eat couscous!<br /><br /><br /><br />19 January 2004<br />Swimming Pool<br />Fran&#231;ois Ozon, France / UK, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />The French take on Adaptation I guess, and a lot more subtle, and less funny - but with lots of boobs.  However, despite the tittilation factor I found it somewhat bland, though at least it didn't have the annoying quirkiness of "8 Women". Charlotte Rampling handled it well, but it felt so lifeless, contrived and predictable.  I don't think Ozon is a director I care about or ever want to watch again.  <br /><br /><br /><br />21 January 2004<br />The Butterfly Effect<br />Eric Bress / J. Mackye Gruber, USA, 2004<br />Location: Showcase North<br />Format: 35mm theatrical<br />Company: Al<br />When the camera pulled back on the last scene and showed Ashton Kutcher walking through a city, Al hoped that the World Trade Center would be visibile.  Hey, I actually liked this film.  I didn't love it, nor would I recommend anyone bother seeing it in a theater, but it was fun and delivered two hours of entertainment.  Plus I got a wristband, a pen, and I won a t-shirt thanks to Al feeding me the answers to Ashton Kutcher trivia.  And I will even go as far as saying that Ashton Kutcher isn't that bad.  The film was intense and fucked up at times - far more fucked up than I expected - so for that reason alone it was a pleasant surprise.  <br /><br /><br /><br />22 January 2004<br />Stone Reader<br />Mark Moskowitz, USA, 2002<br />Location: Andy's<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: Andy<br />There's a lot of ways I could be critical of this film - it's not really a documentary, but a non-fiction creative film; there are a lot of parts that could have been excised to make it shorter; and his portrayal of Dow Mossman is not always that sympathetic.  However, I love it, and the second time I loved it even more.  This is the only personal nonfiction film I have ever seen that can be ranked alongside Ross McElwee's best work, but because it's about literature it makes it even better.  I must dub this and mail it to Miriam, for even she would enjoy this!<br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2004<br />Bande &#224; part<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1964<br />Location: Brookline<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: Dad<br />I think this was similar to Breathless in how it glamorized the criminal life but operated in a detached, somewhat loose manner.  I probably enjoyed it a lot more - Arthur was such a slimeball that I enjoyed his performance, and Odile was so vulnerable (yet cute).  I also now understand Hal Hartley's random dance interlude in Simple Men - it has to be a reference to this.  Fun, but I still think Contempt is my favorite Godard film.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2004<br />Hiroshima mon amour<br />Alain Resnais, France / Japan, 1959<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />This film falls chronologically between the other two Resnais films I've seen - Night and Fog and Marienbad - and unsurprisingly it feels like a thematic midpoint.  While a study in human atrocity like Night and Fog, it also touches on the uncertainty of memory like Marienbad does.  But the love story at the core of this movie is incredibly human, and it's certainly due to the feminine hand of Margurite Duras.  This was a pretty incredible film to watch, although the thrills were more internal; I thought midway through that it was sort of like a Joseph McElroy novel tuned into a film.  Also, the cinematography by a young Sacha Vierny uses some of the same lightning techniques that he employs later with Greenaway, though it's rendered in a stark black and white here. The bonus features had an interview with Resnais from the early 60's that was fun to watch - he is surprisingly humble and down to earth.  His explanation of Marienbad puts it into the context of modernism, with the role of the viewer/reader being that of the storyteller.  Fantastic.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 January 2004<br />Bubba Ho-tep<br />Don Coscarelli, USA, 2002<br />Location: Oaks<br />Format: 35mm theatrical<br />Company: Brad, Ilona, Lori, Adam<br />Even though the director was there, and stood around answering question for 45 minutes after the film and he seemed like a cool guy, I can't say that I enjoyed this film in any way whatsoever.  The humour was imbecilic, and the quirky, absurd plot certainly looked better on paper.  Bruce Campbell played a good Elvis, I guess, but Ossie Davis was really the highlight of the movie - unfortunately, his part was a bit underplayed.   Best part: eat the dog dick of Anubis, asswipe!<br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2004<br />Du bi quan wang da po xue di zi<br />Yu Wang, Taiwan / Hong Kong, 1975<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />I'm not typically a fan of Kung Fu movies, but this was so ludicrous that I enjoyed all 94 minutes of it.  The fight scenes were surreal enough to be in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and the Flying Guillotine weapon was quite imaginative.  The dubbed version was definitely the way to go, as different scenes came from different prints, so the characters English voices would change between an aristocratic British voice and a southern American from shot-to-shot (though some scenes didn't even have dubbing).  The tournament was dazzling AND hilarious.  And the very fact that the last scene is a battle between a one-armed man and a blind guy should make the movie enticing to anyone, kung-fu fan or not.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2004<br />Cercle rouge, Le<br />Jean-Pierre Melville, France / Italy, 1970<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />Stunning (though lengthy) French thriller about a jewel heist, Le Cercle Rouge is an obvious homage to Rififi (with a long, near-silent jewel heist the centerpiece of both films).  But this is a film in color, and it uses the color in the most remarkable way.  The entire film feels like a painting, and this allows the languid pace to give the film a spiritual resonance (no thanks to the opening Buddhist salvo).  Yves Montand is fantastic as the film's tragic hero, and perhaps the only truly likeable character.  The moralizing is fairly simplistic, and so is the plot, for that matter - it's really close to The Killing of a Chinese Bookie in it's gesture, and this oddly controlled looseness is it's charm.  <br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2004<br />Fight Club<br />David Fincher, USA / Germany, 1999<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />In typical John Fail fashion, it takes me five years to see this film; I didn't avoid it in college, but it just didn't strike me as something I might be interested in.  And now viewing it in some perspective, it seems like the definitive film of the late 90's in a way, at least countercuturally.  Moving with a quick pulse, Fincher is dazzling in his quick edits, camera trickery and fantastic rumblings; it strikes me as such a vital piece of the zeitgeist and I wish I would have seen it five years ago if only to compare it to now.  The philosophical/political basis behind the film is especially timely - it fits perfectly in an America swarmed over by neoliberalism, suffering from rampant prosperity.  It's hard to not think of the Seattle WTO riots, the decline of the Internet, and the looming shadow of George W Bush and September 11th when watching this, especially the terrorist aspect.  I can't even imagine what sort of impact this would have had on me if I had seen it in high school. While this film isn't able to fully develop all of it's ideas (opting instead for a tight plot and quick-moving storyline), it proceeds in an intelligent manner - and I can't help but compare it to the oscar winner for that year, "American Beauty," which is a far less worthwhile film in my opinion.  But I wonder just how worthwhile it is - how many people seeing this film were affected by it's screams against consumerism,etc (though I don't think the film offered any easy answers or oversimplifications - at least it was a lot more intelligent than I expected a Hollywood film to be).   If a film version of the Illuminatus trilogy ever could be made, Fincher would probably be a good choice to direct it.   Also, Project Mayhem is like the Cacophony Society if they had some balls.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 January 2004<br />The Weather Underground<br />Sam Green / Bill Siegel, USA, 2002<br />Location: Melwood<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Brian<br />A documentary on an organization I have always been somewhat interested in, this gave me way more information than I knew and surprised me a few times (I couldn't believe how many actual bombings they did).  However, a lot of the movie was just a laundry list of actions without going into much detail.  Also, I would have liked to understand more about what it was like to live "underground", though I guess it's not as interesting as it sounds.  Still, it was a very well-assembled film that presented a pretty fair view of the group, from what I can tell - despite interviewing actual members, it didn't gloss over their flaws.  They really seemed more like fringe wackos than any part of a serious organization, and while a lot of their violent acts seem ill-concieved today, one has to remember what those times were like.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 February 2004<br />Capturing the Friedmans<br />Andrew Jarecki, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />Holy crap!  Totally intense documentary that manages to be as unbiased as any documentary I've ever seen.  After almost two hours I still don't know how I feel about the situation, and which side I believe.  I would honestly say it's 50/50 given the material presented in the film.  Tis documentary was made more riveting by the presence of original footage shot during the family crisis, by an enterprising David Freidman; it's hard not to feel sympathy and repulsion at the same time while watching this,  which makes it pretty incredible.  A must-see.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 February 2004<br />Spoorloos<br />George Sluizer, Netherlands / France, 1988<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />Like Alain Resnais directing Crime and Punishment, this film was a stunning bit of French noir.  Bernard-Pierre Donadieu was fantastic - his facial expressions carried much of the film - and his affable bad-guy was a nice inversion when compared to the intense, unpleasant good guy. Memories are played with just like in Marienbad, though there's enough of a weird plot to move things along.  I've never seen the remake, and I'll probably keep it that way.  Favorite theme: domestic horror.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 February 2004<br />Northfork<br />Michael Polish, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />A beautiful, tranquil film that reflects on the American landscape, good/evil, belief, architecture, color, and a bunch of other things, all while kept in a dreamlike, fantasy state.  There were shades of Guy Madden in this, but it actually beared more of a resemblance to Songs From the Second Floor - it's surreal episodes unfolded slowly, with a great deal of symbolism.  Most of the film was laced with a gentle humour, which helped to tone down the more theological implications of the story, though at a few points the humour fell very flat.  But the cinematographer deserves some awards for transforming Montana into a magical place, and Polish managed to get good performances out of James Woods, Nick Nolte, and Daryl Hannah (none of whom I have ever considered to be good actors).   Although I am a sucker for films like this, I was really pleasantly surprised, and I want to check out more by these guys.  <br /><br /><br /><br />23 February 2004<br />Pr&#233;parez vos mouchoirs<br />Bertrand Blier, Belgium / France, 1978<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />I am a big Bertand Blier fan at this point, and while this was the most tame film of his that I have seen so far, it was still quite enjoyable.  His zany sense of humour is present throughout, and it remained fucked-up under a layer of accessiblility.  Carol Laure is one of the greatest actresses ever for taking shit; she is utterly degraded in "Sweet Movie," and in this she is also treated like a piece of meat.  Unlike "Going Places," Depardieu and Dewaere's dickheadness catches up to them and they wind up losing (though it's assumed that they will have a happy life together, and this could even been seen as the prequel to "Going Places").  The summer camp plot really switches gears, reminding me of that one Young Ones episode where suddenly they are all farmers for no apparent reason.  I don't know if there is much deep meaning in this film, but it's pretty great anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 March 2004<br />Beau-p&#232;re<br />Bertrand Blier, France, 1981<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />While this film didn't contain hardly any humour, it was still pretty great.  Patrick Dewaere is a truly great actor, and it's a shame that he died so young, for he would probably be a household name.  This is really a film about weakness, as his character continually succumbs to his own inability to face hard reality.  And it's also about temptation, and pleasure, and it's presented in a manner that makes the subject matter not as shocking as it should be.  I see why DVDean liked this so much, even though it isn't really all that funny.  <br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2004<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Scott Bricker<br />No further comments are necessary, are they?<br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2004<br />Super Troopers<br />Jay Chandrasekhar, USA, 2001<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Scott Bricker<br />I was drinking during this film, so by the time the end rolled around when the cops were all drunk, I too was drunk.  And this type of partcipatory action makes a film more enjoyable, doesn't it?  I now understand why this is a sort of weird cult favorite - these guys are actually pretty funny. But they don't overact, like Kids in the Hall-type sketch comedy.  There were some subtleties to the humour too, at times at least, which wasn't at all what I expected.  File under "Smart Stupid Comedy."<br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2004<br />Cinemania<br />Angela Christlieb / Stephen Kijak, Germany / USA, 2002<br />Location: home<br />Format: NTSC Region 1 D<br />Company: none<br />At first a lighthearted, cheap and fun documentary about a group of obsessed movie buffs in New York City, this film slowly unfolds into something much sadder.  Of course, it was quite entertaining, and the filmmakers knew to keep it short at 80 minutes.  The main guy Jack actually seems like a run down version of Sam Ippolito, so I found his personality somewhat familiar.  I wonder if some day they will make a movie about PBT?<br /><br /><br /><br />13 March 2004<br />Super Troopers<br />Jay Chandrasekhar, USA, 2001<br />Location: Adam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Adam, Weisel<br />The second time through, there are some parts of this that really grow on me.  Although I realized that it's just an updated 'Police Academy' movie, basically.  Still, genuinely great and from a class of comedy that I rarely indulge in.  Want to see 'Club Dread'.  And I want to see this while sober.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 March 2004<br />Playhouse<br />Hunter F. Roberts, USA, 2003<br />Location: home<br />Format: Self-released D<br />Company: Al<br />Genuinely worthless 90 minutes, supposedly a horror comedy, but without any redeeming value.  I can forgive bad acting and a weak plot; the problem here was the attempts at humour.  There was nothing funny about this at all.  Some of the gore scenes were okay, though.  I'd recommend for anyone reading this to avoid it, but since it will probably never be released, it's nothing you have to worry about.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 April 2004<br />Kill Bill: Vol. 1<br />Quentin Tarantino, USA, 2003<br />Location: Caleb's<br />Format: Bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: Caleb<br />Entertaining and wonderfully violent revenge fantasy. Empty as hell, but featuring a nice appearance from Chigusa #9.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 April 2004<br />Withnail &#38; I<br />Bruce Robinson, UK, 1987<br />Location: Caleb's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Caleb<br />It:s weird watching something so many times that you don:t even have to really watch it anymore.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2004<br />The Matrix Revolutions<br />Andy Wachowski / Larry Wachowski, USA, 2003<br />Location: airplane<br />Format: Airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />Ugh.  I agree with Caleb - after seeing this one, the second one actually seems good.   I could have done without an hour-long robot fight.  Fuck this shit.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2004<br />Big Fish<br />Tim Burton, USA, 2003<br />Location: airplane<br />Format: Airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />Wonderful, upbeat Americana that actually made me tear up at the end.  Albert Finney rules.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 April 2004<br />Mystic River<br />Clint Eastwood, USA, 2003<br />Location: airplane<br />Format: Airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />Eastwood borrows some tricks from John Sayles with this layered, slowly unfolding murder mystery.  Sean Penn shouldn't have won any awards cause all he did was ape DeNiro; Kevin Bacon was pretty awesome though.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 April 2004<br />Stone Reader<br />Mark Moskowitz, USA, 2002<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, taped<br />Company: none<br />Watched this again cause I had just finished The Stones of Summer and it was lying here.  I've now seen this more than anyone should but I still dig it.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 April 2004<br />Romancing the Stone<br />Robert Zemeckis, Mexico / USA, 1984<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Miriam<br />Miriam inherited this VHS with the apartment, so for lack of anything better to watch I gave this a spin.  I haven't seen it in over 10 years so I expected it to be terrible, but it wasn't as bad as I remembered.  At least, Kathleen Turner is a better actress than I thought, and it's paced/edited well, providing a fairly compelling Hollywood adventure movie.  Or maybe it just seems better than it is, because I am starved for entertainment here in small-town Japan.   Tomorrow: "The Jewel of the Nile".  <br /><br /><br /><br />2 May 2004<br />Random Hearts<br />Sydney Pollack, USA, 1999<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: none<br />Harrison Ford delivers one of the worst performances of his carreer in this horrendous, banal romance.  I only watched this because I was bored out of my mind and it was here and there was nothing else to do.  There was a brief appearance by Peter Coyote, and the guy who played the grizzly old black dude in The Hudsucker Proxy, and that was pretty much the best part.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 May 2004<br />Contact<br />Robert Zemeckis, USA, 1997<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Wides<br />Company: none<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the first half - here was sci-fi that seemed more descended from Tarkovsky than Star Wars, and with striking cinematography that emphasized the feeling of being alone in the galaxy.  But the second half really fell apart, and it turned into a ridiculous farce.  Still, I enjoyed it a lot and John Hurt's character was hilarious.  Could have almost had a great twist ending, and sort of did.  Recommended if you're alone in Japan with nothing else to watch.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 May 2004<br />WarGames<br />John Badham, USA, 1983<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS taped <br />Company: Miriam<br />Watching this again was pretty fun; as cheesy as it is, it's pretty entertaining.  Matthrew Broderick was SO young.  CPS1704TKE.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 May 2004<br />The Fugitive<br />Andrew Davis, USA, 1993<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS taped <br />Company: Miriam<br />Miriam's predecessor must have really loved Harrison Ford, yet she doesn't have any of the Indiana Jones movies, unfortunately.  Well-paced and well-shot (I think - the SLP video didn't look too hot) this is a good remake of the classic TV series.  Watched it and hardly thought of anything for two hours.  <br /><br /><br /><br />4 May 2004<br />Cocktail<br />Roger Donaldson, USA, 1988<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: none<br />Beats out Romancing the Stone and Random Hearts to be the worst film I've watched here.  A testimony to the Reagan 80's, emphasizing how financial success can come without relying on charity through hard work and capitalism.  Also glorifies alcoholism, somewhat.  This was easy to watch though because I imagined Weisel as Tom Cruise, Lloyd as the guy from FX who drinks himself to death, and Miracles as the bar he finally manages to open at the end. Perhaps it's time to film a remake?<br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2004<br />Air Force One<br />Wolfgang Petersen, USA / Germany, 1997<br />Location: Miriam's<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Miriam, Brian<br />Not even that enjoyable for it's camp/schmaltz value.  The terrible special effects were the best part.  TERRIBLE.  Must have spent the whole budget on casting, which was a mistake.  Why would you cast William H Macy in a heroic role???<br /><br /><br /><br />24 May 2004<br />The Statement<br />Norman Jewison, Canada / France / UK, 2003<br />Location: airplane<br />Format: Airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />Horrendously limp attempt at intellectual thriller; had so much potential (exploring the conspiracy/secrecies of the upper arms of the Catholic church) that was wasted.  Michael Caine was excellent as always, here portraying a nontagonist that was morally questionable, but without offering any answers.  Tilda Swinton was annoying,  but the other guy was the best part.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 May 2004<br />Welcome to Mooseport<br />Donald Petrie, USA / Germany, 2004<br />Location: airplane<br />Format: Airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />Terrible, thin comedy set in Maine where Gene Hackman retired as a US president.  Had a straight-to-video feel, but I sat through it anyway -- it was most interesting to think about how many films about the president are made - air force one for example - and how societies always create stories about kings and rulers regardless of their government type.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 May 2004<br />Main Hoon Na<br />Farah Khan, India, 2004<br />Location: bus to Ahmedabad <br />Format: Bootleg VCD, wi<br />Company: bus full of people<br />Wacky Bollywood blockbuster that was showing on the bus; the only film I watched of the 3 but since it was mostly in Hindi I couldn't fully understand it.  Some parts were funny and I may actually seek out a translated version because it seems very, very off-the-hook wacky and full of references to American films and culture.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 June 2004<br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br />Alfonso Cuar&#243;n, UK / USA, 2004<br />Location: PVR, South Delhi<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Aditya, Naren, Uday, other guy<br />With a new director and Michael Gambon in Dumbledore's shoes, the third Harry Potter movie was miles above the first wo.  The superior story had the most to do with this, though the cinematography, special effects and editing was also vastly improved.  This was the most uncomfortable movie theater experience of my life, however, and I left with a sore neck.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 June 2004<br />High Fidelity<br />Stephen Frears, UK / USA, 2000<br />Location: Bangalore hotel room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, F<br />Company: none<br />It's hard to deny the likeability of this film.  I guess a film that is filled with references to the exclusive, obscure subculture that you are part of makes it better - enough to override the dumb romantic comedy shit.  Also, I think it's funny to see Ian Williams on TV in India at 8 AM.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 June 2004<br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<br />Terry Gilliam, USA, 1998<br />Location: Bangalore hotel room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, F<br />Company: none<br />After watching this a second time, it is now definitely in my pantheon of all-time favorite movies.  Why was HBO India showing this on TV at 9 AM?<br /><br /><br /><br />24 June 2004<br />Kill Bill: Vol. 2<br />Quentin Tarantino, USA, 2004<br />Location: Prince Caf?, Hampi<br />Format: Bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: Anna, Katy, Charlie, Nathan, bunch of kids<br />Barely watched this - didn't really have the interest.  I found myself not really caring by the end whether or not she actually killed Bill.  There was a lot less action and asskicking than the first one, and that is the only real selling point of these films.  It still had it's moments, but it's like the amusement you get flipping through TV rather than a lasting work of art you would want to watch again and again.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 June 2004<br />Wayne's World 2<br />Stephen Surjik, USA, 1993<br />Location: Mumbai hotel room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, F<br />Company: none<br />Okay - it's not as good as the first one (what could be?) but surprisingly watchable.  Ralph Brown plays the exact same role he plays in Withnail and I, for one thing.  And the surreal, fucked-up humour is amusing enough to keep the pace moving.  Christopher Walken practically phoned in his performance though, and Tia Carrerre is still horrible (but with a smaller role I think).  It's interesting to see this movie on the cusp of grunge.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2004<br />Lost in Translation<br />Sofia Coppola, USA / Japan, 2003<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: none<br />Watching this again - after having basically lived it - was somewhat devastating.  The narrative aspect became irrelevant (although that part was hard for me too) and I was most taken by the sense of alienation conveyed.  It's really fucking accurate and hit me pretty hard.  And Bill Murray's nuances really leapt out in a much stronger way than before - his attitudes were similar to my own at times.  <br /><br /><br /><br />9 July 2004<br />Fahrenheit 9/11<br />Michael Moore, USA, 2004<br />Location: GFT<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Daniel, Lu<br />I could list things that annoyed me about this, but the bottom line is that it was the #1 film in America and millions of Americans will see it and hopefully be influenced by it.  Moore may not be a responsible filmmaker, but he is one whose views I agree with so I am glad he is doing what he is doing.  My own hatred of the Bush administration has reached such levels that I think it's a bit unhealthy, so it's nice to have my feelings vindicated before the American public.  And he stayed behind the camera almost the entire time, which was a good move.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 July 2004<br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind<br />Michel Gondry, USA, 2004<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: none<br />A Charlie Kaufmann script is going to be full of quirks, but this one surpasses the novelty value.  Memory is a favorite topic of mine, and while this is a lot more in touch with today's filmmaking styles than Last Year at Marienbad, it still shows cinema to be one of the most powerful ways to play with memory.  Besides the quirks this is a pretty successful love story, though a sad and dysfunctional one, and Jim Carey acts with an honesty that I never would have expected from him.  Gondry, you have finally done something worthwhile.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 July 2004<br />The Man Who Fell to Earth<br />Nicolas Roeg, UK, 1976<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS, taped <br />Company: none<br />A great film - and I don't know why it took me so long to finally see this - but what does it mean?  Of course Roeg films from this golden period can't provide answers to such questions, but it's fun to watch and see the man at his peak.  Also it has shades of the Howard Hughes/Gemstone Files kidnapping conspiracy theory that I was just reading about....<br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2004<br />Edward Scissorhands<br />Tim Burton, USA, 1990<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, W<br />Company: none<br />Thinking back, I first saw this movie at Shawn Altman's sixth-grade birthday party.  I barely remembered anything about it, and what I did remember was probably just that it was weird.  Seeing it after all of these years was sort of fun - it was better than I remembered and I guess my recent appreciation of Johnny Depp adds to my enjoyment.  The surrealism was certainly lost on me as a kid; watching it now I was bored at times, but I see Burton's American suburbia as the sort of flipside to David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" - a more fairytale approach but with a lot of the same ideas.  Alan Arkin is pretty great, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 August 2004<br />Das Experiment<br />Oliver Hirschbiegel, Germany, 2001<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, W<br />Company: none<br />Based on the very interesting Stanford Prison Experiment (but of course sensationalizing it beyond belief) this is a pretty fun thriller that would fit right in place if it was made when the experiment actually happened.  The over the top dramatic flourishes are borrowed from Hollywood thrillers, and the editing and acting is spot-on for what these kind of movies need.  The love story was ridiculous and there's some pretty implausible aspects to the plot, but there's no point in picking apart the flaws in this movie since it's just an entertaining late-night diversion on TV.  These kind of movies are supposed to be cheesy, right?<br /><br /><br /><br />5 August 2004<br />The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 1: The Moab Story<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Spain / Italy / Luxembourg / Netherlands / Russia / Hungary / Germany, 2003<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: PAL Region 2 DV<br />Company: none<br />Oh crap.  How do I begin to collect my thoughts about this, a film that I have been anxiously awaiting for like 2 years?  This may be Greenaway's most "difficult" film ever - it doesn't surprise me that he can't find good distribution for it, because it's so ambitious and over the top with his obsessions that I don't think anyone but the most hardcore PG fan could really get much out of it.  After one sitting I am already thinking about watching it again to try and make some more sense.  This is clearly the most overtly autobiographical PG film to date, even more than Belly - though the references to his older films seem a bit gratuitious (besides the direct Luper-isms of VFR and Water Wrackets).  Is Luper's continual imprisonment and misfortune at the hands of a conspirators PG's cries at his critics?  Why did he change the swastika to some other weird symbol?  In a sense the mystery of the early films is a bit destroyed now that we can visualize Luper and actually see a piece of his story.  The film-as-artifice gestures (the auditions in the film most notably) are clever and first explored in 8.5 women a bit.  Van Hoyten is appropriately malevolent, though the exaggerated, overdramatic acting of the Americans is not going to win him any audiences.  More thoughts to come with viewing #2, for sure....<br /><br /><br /><br />5 August 2004<br />Billy Liar<br />John Schlesinger, UK, 1963<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS, Full-f<br />Company: none<br />A classic of 60's British cinema, with Tom Courtenay as a hearthrobbingly great dreamer.  Echoes of Catcher in the Rye and Bottle Rocket kept passing through my mind; Julie Christie was also spot-on perfect as usual.  Did Billy make the right decision at the end?  I dunno - certainly his problems were due to his own boneheadedness, and I don't feel sympathy for him there, but he could leave and still sort his life out.  <br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2004<br />Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Leonard Cohen<br />Donald Brittain / Don Owen, Canada, 1965<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: Region free DVD<br />Company: none<br />This biopic of Leonard Cohen on the eve of his songwriting career shows a successful, affluent young poet ready to make his mark on the world.  It's done in a really stodgy documentary style, but that makes it more charming.  In a way it seems to be a film about his relationship with Canada, which I've never really thought about in his work.  The poetry throughout is marvelous, and it's just so crazy to see him young and eager, ready to take on the world....<br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2004<br />Wild at Heart<br />David Lynch, USA, 1990<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS, Full-f<br />Company: none<br />Featuring all of the usual David Lynch elements - a sinister, localized American violence centered around a small town, an obsession with B-movie cliches, trashy behavior and shitty loungey music, and hack surrealism - this pile of shit was a complete waste of two hours, except for the part where Willem Dafoe's head gets blown off.  Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are absolutely hard to watch as the leading couple with the worst screen chemistry I have seen in a long time.  I understand the satirical aspects of this plot but I still think it's a pile of crap.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 August 2004<br />JFK<br />Oliver Stone, USA / France, 1991<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: TV Broadcast, W<br />Company: none<br />Is this possibly the best conspiracy film of all time?  I love the countless factual distortions to make the story more entertaining.  I love the best career performances by Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci and Donald Sutherland.  I love the lengthy, overblown closing speech by Kevin Costner in my all-time favorite courtroom scene besides "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I love how the film totally heroizes Jim Garrison (and casts him in a perverse cameo as Earl Warren) while glossing over his absolutely deplorable interrogation methods.  I love the case against Clay Shaw, which was pretty much groundless based on most of the evidence that I have read, blown up to be meaningful (and attempted to be justified with epilogue titles).  But really, I do love this film beyond it's flaws because it's really great and made people think and it's fun and I love conspiracy stuff.  Thanks to BBC1 for airing this tonight!<br /><br /><br /><br />11 August 2004<br />Fight Club<br />David Fincher, USA / Germany, 1999<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: Region free DVD<br />Company: none<br />I've been reading Robert Anton Wilson lately, and he writes a lot about "reality-tunnels" and how the human mind is powerful enough to create the realities around us.  This film makes a good companion piece to get the mind buzzing, although I must admit I wasn't thinking of that when I threw it on this afternoon.  Brilliant and able to be read multiple ways, like Ulysses which Wilson keeps coming back to.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 August 2004<br />Poor Cow<br />Ken Loach, UK, 1967<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS, Full-f<br />Company: none<br />I've always wanted to see this, but I never realized what a slice of social realism it is - I guess this is what Ken Loach is famous for, though it's really more interesting as a snapshot of the late 1960's.  Terence Stamp is great, but unfortuntaely not in the film enough.  The style is interesting - loose, perhaps influential on Altman - with some direct interview mixed in and clever titles.  <br /><br /><br /><br />14 August 2004<br />A Zed &#38; Two Noughts<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands, 1985<br />Location: Alex's room<br />Format: PAL DVD, Widesc<br />Company: none<br />Watching the gorgeous new BFI DVD with Greenaway's commentary track is like a wet dream fulfilled.  Even though I have seen this film nine or ten times, I can't help but think every time I see it how it's one of the most inspiring works of art in my life.  It's just overflowing with ideas, and hearing Greenaway give even more insight into his work was like seeing it for the first time, in a way.  However, with so much to talk about (and there are times when he just can't keep up with the film), he repeats himself a lot too, pointing out the symmetry of almost every scene when he makes the point pretty early on.  But I am not complaining.  I can't wait to watch this on my parents' new 53" TV.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 August 2004<br />Liquid Sky<br />Slava Tsukerman, USA, 1982<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS, Full-f<br />Company: none<br />I kept thinking that this was like if Guy Maddin directed Jubilee, only crossed with a Lite-Brite.  Excessive stylistic flourishes pretty much save this movie from being more than a sci-fi/exploitation b-movie, and the portrait of early 80's avant-drug culture is pretty amusing to me.  The German dude was the best part, playing the straight man, and his awkward moments picked up the film when it became tedious.  Not at all shocking or provocative to me, this was nevertheless a fun time.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 August 2004<br />Repulsion<br />Roman Polanski, UK, 1965<br />Location: Chris's room<br />Format: PAL VHS taped f<br />Company: none<br />Moody.  Edgy.  Catherine Deneuve is fucking crazy and the first-rate cinematography and soundtrack make it all the more convincing.  The part where she puts the rabbit piece in her purse made me think of the part in Henry Green's novel Party Going where a crazy woman puts a dead pigeon in her purse.  I am always thinking about parallels and connections between works of art that I see/read within a few weeks of one another; maybe I should keep a new spreadsheet for this?<br /><br /><br /><br />24 August 2004<br />A Zed &#38; Two Noughts<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands, 1985<br />Location: Tuulikki's<br />Format: PAL DVD, Widesc<br />Company: Chris, Hanna<br />Even though I watched this last week I was ready to tackle it again.  Every time I watch this I get more out of it- even just little novelties in the dialogue, like when Van Hoyten says "There are 8 parts and we're only in the 3rd" during the 3rd part of the 8 part movie. Fuckin' A.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 August 2004<br />The Big Lebowski<br />Joel Coen / Ethan Coen, USA / UK, 1998<br />Location: Oliver's flat<br />Format: PAL VHS widescr<br />Company: Oliver<br />Ditched Alex and Chris to go watch this for the 19th time.  Drank beer throughout, sort of fell asleep though still awake.   Great.  But that's just like your opinion, man.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 September 2004<br />Super Size Me<br />Morgan Spurlock, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: Xvid data playe<br />Company: Anthony, Mom, Dad<br />Enjoyable, pointed non-fiction film about obesity in America.  Humorous and fun, though powerful in it's argument - and something that is aimed at all Americans.  <br /><br /><br /><br />10 September 2004<br />Club Dread<br />Jay Chandrasekhar, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: NTSC DVD, wides<br />Company: Anthony<br />Pretty shitty semi-comedy from the Broken Lizard guys who made the excellent "Super Troopers".  This made me laugh a few times but was generally about as worthless as "Wet Hot American Summer."  Jay Chandrasekhar was probably the best part and that's not saying much.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 September 2004<br />Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism<br />Robert Greenwald, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: NTSC DVD, full-<br />Company: Anthony, Mom<br />Good argument against Fox News, although I hardly needed convincing.  The footage was well-chosen, and pretty humorous at times.  Bill O'Reilly is even more disgusting than I thought - I should probably start watching him for fun, though it will probably just make me more angry and misanthropic.  While I feel that corporate media control is probably the biggest problem in America, I can't say that I feel optimisitic - and this film, while a great piece, will unforunately not make any impact whatsoever.  But I guess I'm just too cynical.  Still, the film would leave you thinking that Fox is the only right-wing news channel.  Highlight: Bernie Sanders.  That guy is so awesome.  The Sweetapples are so lucky to be represented by him.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 September 2004<br />The School of Rock<br />Richard Linklater, USA / Germany, 2003<br />Location: den<br />Format: copied DVD, wid<br />Company: none<br />Fun children's film, a hell of a lot better than Elf, and it reminded me a lot of the Bad News Bears (but relying on Jack Black's over the top comedy instead of Walter Matthau's understated genius). If Black starts to grate on you (and he does with me after about half of this film), then there's little else to redeem it.  Robert pointed out that there is almost no serious conflict in this film.  For the last few days I've been really into the demo version of the Velvet Underground's "Ride Into the Sun" - just a slow guitar instrumental that I've been playing for some reason over and over.  It pops up in this film, which is weird synchronicity for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 September 2004<br />Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story<br />Rawson Marshall Thurber, USA / Germany, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: pirated copy wa<br />Company: Anthony, Mom<br />I really wanted to see this mostly because the Guardian gave it FIVE STARS - which I don't think they awarded to anything else the whole summer.  As mainstream dumb comedies go, this is pretty solid - it stays tasteful, isn't too long, and is genuinely funny (hilarious in parts).  I wonder if the main character's name LeFleur was a reference to "Safe Men"?  "Safe Men" is still the high water mark for these types of films (I don't think Anchorman counts) but this was definitely good - maybe better than Zoolander?<br /><br /><br /><br />18 September 2004<br />Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2004<br />Location: Dependable drive-in, Moon Township<br />Format: Drive-in 35mm m<br />Company: Anthony<br />I have to agree with Andy - this film is brilliant.  With the potential to be watched many, many times.  While I've always loved stupid comedies, I feel that in the past year or so I've developed a much bigger appetite for them.  I guess if it feels right, you gotta roll with it.  This was great.  I thought I was going to shit my pants laughing throughout.  I've never been impresed by Will Farrell before, but now I think he's the new Chevy Chase.  Well done.  Superb.  Absurd.  Ludicrous.  I love lamp.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 September 2004<br />Heavenly Creatures<br />Peter Jackson, UK / Germany / New Zealand, 1994<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast ("<br />Company: none<br />I see now after watching this why Jackson was able to get the green light for Lord of the Rings; this is a completely different film, but also a fantasy that relied on the imagination and viewer's emotional involvement in something unreal.  He colored this film like a Fauvian artist, with brights and drabs where appropriate, creating a really painterly look (and of course emphasizing the fantastical nature of the protagonists minds).  The drama of adolescence is captured well, but so is the excitement that fuels teen drama.  And the ending, while being built up to throughout the first 90 minutes, becomes essentially irrelevant by the time it rolls around - probably just my interpretation, and not a specific stylistic choice, but an interesting narrative approach in my reading.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 September 2004<br />The Belly of an Architect<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Italy, 1987<br />Location: living room<br />Format: NTSC DVD, wides<br />Company: none<br />While watching on the 53" TV, I couldn't help but think how since I had never seen this before in widescreen, I really had never seen it before at all.  It again baffles me that Greenaway is accused of being cold, because this is one of his most human works.  Stourley Kracklite is as vulnerable of a protagonist as Mastriani in 8 1/2 or Kinski in Fitzacarroldo; he is hedonistic, egocentric, and obsessive - but these are not necessarily negative.  Greenaway clearly has some autobiographical tendencies here - and perhaps he is taking a swipe at himself, with his obsessive focus on art.  Dennehy is such a pleasure to watch in this film - he falls apart in such a perfect manner.  The static right-angles throughout this film reflect the rhythms of architecture itself.  Glad to now own this on DVD (and it looks good!).<br /><br /><br /><br />24 September 2004<br />Casa de los babys<br />John Sayles, USA / Mexico, 2003<br />Location: living room<br />Format: NTSC DVD, wides<br />Company: none<br />John Sayles has the ability to make a dull subject interesting; here he takes six women waiting around in Latin America to adopt babies and makes a captivating 90 minutes out of it.  It addresses third world rich/poor issues of course, but it's really more about motherhood, communication, and our expectations.  There are some really low-key yet amazing scenes, like when the Irish woman talks with the chambermaid and they don't understand each other's languages; the child and his book about the goat (which reminds me of David Straithairn's character in City of Hope for some reason); and the banter between Marcia Gay Harden and the lawyer. This isn't a film that a lot of people would get excited about, but fans will appreciate it.  It's always surprising to me how well Sayles understands women; watching this or Passion Fish it's hard to believe that a male wrote these scripts.  <br /><br /><br /><br />25 September 2004<br />Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br />Michael Ian Black / Michael Showalter / David Wain, USA, 2002<br />Location: Pat's room<br />Format: VHS taped from <br />Company: Pat, Eric<br />Lots of fun watching this for the first time in awhile, and with Pat who of course is great to watch funny shit with.  Eric seemed to really love it too.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 September 2004<br />Harold &#38; Kumar Go to White Castle<br />Danny Leiner, USA / Canada / Germany, 2004<br />Location: my room<br />Format: AVI file, watch<br />Company: none<br />I have no opposition to stoner comedies, and I like the idea of something this absurd.  It's good to see two minorities in the lead roles, even if the film does draw too much attention to it.  But the humour falls flat at times, creating a dumb comedy less funny and more dumb than "Dude, Where's My Car" which at least relied on Ashton Kucher's good looks.  Still, I sat through it though I deleted it from my hard drive when it was over.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 September 2004<br />Gates of Heaven<br />Errol Morris, USA, 1978<br />Location: Theatre room<br />Format: AVI file, proje<br />Company: Robert, Ellen, Jeremy, Porter<br />While low on thrills, Erol Morris' first film is charming and pretty funny at times.  I always like when mundane subjects are explored, and this is certainly a film about mundane people.  There's little of his hyper-stylized later work, and it almost feels like a student film.  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 October 2004<br />American Splendor<br />Shari Springer Berman / Robert Pulcini, USA, 2003<br />Location: my room<br />Format: AVI file on TV <br />Company: none<br />"American Splendor" is a really, well, splendid biopic on Harvey Pekar.  It carries over the things I've always loved most about his comic - the celebration of the mundane, the pessimism, and the inherent sadness of routine.  Instead of focusing on some traditional movie type of storyline, the store moves between episodes of his life (with Their Cancer Year not even being the emphasis of the film).  Veal Chop was absolutely incredible, and the integration of the real life characters is perfect, and made sense in the context of the script.  The film looked great too - the muted browns and sepiatones formed a love poem to the Midwestern city.   Also, Veal Chop will be PERFECT as NIgel Turner when I make "The Pickled Egg Story" (if he can do a good limey accent).<br /><br /><br /><br />7 October 2004<br />Chuck &#38; Buck<br />Miguel Arteta, USA, 2000<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: VHS full frame<br />Company: none<br />After 2 minutes, I realized that this was going to be an amazingly disturbing film.  It's not even that disturbing - it's just creepy and tense.  Mike White delivers a classic performance of extreme awkwardness.  As someone who used to date a girl that was emotionally underdeveloped in a similar way to Buck, I could relate.  The colors were all washed out - I dunno if that's just the bad VHS transfer or by design.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 October 2004<br />Leonard Part 6<br />Paul Weiland, USA, 1987<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: none<br />This makes 84 minutes feel long.  One of the most absolutely absurd and ludicrous films I have ever seen - even more ridiculous than "Rat Pfink a Boo Boo" - and a fantastic choice for the first release on my DVD bootleg label.  One way to view this is as the terrible doppleganger of "A Zed and Two Noughts".  Seeing a rainbow trout eat a man alive is an incredible experience.  This is also amazing for containing both Tom Courtenay and Joe Don Baker.  <br /><br /><br /><br />14 October 2004<br />Leonard Part 6<br />Paul Weiland, USA, 1987<br />Location: Stettinius Tavern<br />Format: bootleg DVD-R, <br />Company: Spencer<br />Recorded commentary track for Mnemelish release.  On a second viewing it didn't really improve, but I was drunk enough to babble throughout the commentary track.  Bonus points to Spencer for passing out during the recording.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 October 2004<br />The Jerk<br />Carl Reiner, USA, 1979<br />Location: Chez Tremaine<br />Format: VHS full frame<br />Company: Trevor, Sara<br />I haven't seen this since I was extremely young, and it ruled.  Way more off the hook funny than I remembered it being.  Steve Martin was at his height here - this may be my Steve Martin OPO.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 October 2004<br />Nothing So Strange<br />Brian Flemming, USA, 2002<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: MP4 file watche<br />Company: none<br />Interesting.  One one level, we have a great deconstruction of Kennedy assassination theories - pretty much a parody.  We also have a fictional assassination of a living, non-fictional character - and presented in such a realistic way (with the filmmaker going as far as using actor's real names) that it's almost convincing.  Like Coover's Public Burning, this plays with our notions of what a fictional character is.  This is somewhat Peter Watkins-esque too.  But there were times when I found myself wondering what the point was to this film - why bother concoting a conspiracy fantasy?  Do we need to know that conspiracy theorists are fucked up?  But as the film plays out, it becomes a look at the Citizens for Truth group and their dynamic.  It's not the most exciting film in the end, but as a study in psychology it's definitely interesting.  Some might argue that this type of fiction is irresponsible - but I find it stimulating.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 October 2004<br />The Gong Show Movie<br />Chuck Barris, USA, 1980<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: AVI file, on TV<br />Company: none<br />Here's a film that's strange even among strange films.  A week in the life of Chuck Barris, this mostly fictionalized movie really has little purpose, but it still interesting to watch.  There are brilliant Robert Downey Sr.-penned moments, like Phil Hartman's role with the gun , but a lot of it would be unwatchable were it not for Barris' charisma.  After seeing "Confessions..." Barris seems like an even more enigmatic figure, and watching him in person is somewhat rewarding.  The musical number at the end is sort of the summation of the film and possibly the reason for the entire first hour - it's not really that much of a payoff though.  I wish I had a better quality copy of this.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 October 2004<br />Ishtar<br />Elaine May, USA, 1987<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: VHS full-frame<br />Company: Jeremy (Charles Grodin), John Ferguson (Elaine May), Brian (Dustin Hoffman)<br />Recorded commentary track for Mnemelish release.  Pretty hilarious and amazing - John Ferguson really stole the show.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 October 2004<br />Capricorn One<br />Peter Hyams, USA / UK, 1978<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: AVI file on TV <br />Company: none<br />Definitely ranking among the most ridiculous films I've ever seen, I enjoyed this immensely due to the presence of Elliot Gould and the general 1970's paranoia vibe.  There's just something about the approach to cinema in the 70's that makes it my absolute favorite decade for films.  The story is farfetched and some scenes had me laughing out loud - the ending, especially, was like something out of a recent James Bond movie.  Elliot Gould was actually pretty terrible in this, but with a script full of cliches and one-liners I suppose he did the best he could.  Peter Hyams is certainly no Robert Altman, though he did direct such gems as "Stay Tuned" and "The End of Days."<br /><br /><br /><br />30 October 2004<br />Neil Young: Human Highway<br />Dean Stockwell / Neil Young, USA, 1982<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: VHS full-frame<br />Company: Darryl (Neil Young), Trevor (Bob Mothersbaugh), Irene (Kevin Costner)<br />Fun again to record this commentary track, though I think it's lacking the highs of the first two.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 November 2004<br />The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 1: The Moab Story<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Spain / Italy / Luxembourg / Netherlands / Russia / Hungary / Germany, 2003<br />Location: Facets cinemateque<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Miriam, Peter Greenaway, others<br />I just really wanted to list Peter Greenaway on my spreadsheet - it's not like he sat next to me or anything, though I did ask him a question afterwards.  The second time through the narrative aspect of The Tulse Luper Suitcases came to the forefront in a more clear manner, though the stylistic excesses also seemed more contrived.  The question and answer session after the film repeated a lot of the material from the previous night and was unfortunately cut short.  It was still totally awesome to see this on the big screen and especially w/PG in the room and I definitely liked it more the second time, especially when viewing the films as only a minor part of the entire project.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 November 2004<br />The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 2: Vaux to the Sea<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands / Spain / Luxembourg / Italy / Hungary, 2004<br />Location: Facets cinemateque<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Miriam<br />In retrospect the second film was probably my favorite, for as much as PG was saying that it's really one 7-hour film, there were distinct differences between the 3.  We saw the introduction of a second actor playing Luper here which semed to take the attention to artifice to an extreme measure.  On a narrative level, this reminded me a great deal of Gravity's Rainbow, with Luper=Slothrop "In the zone".  Some of the constructions here were just really hilarious and strange.  I stand by this as still being Greenaway's most difficult work.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 November 2004<br />The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 3: From Sark to the Finish<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Spain / Luxembourg / Netherlands / Germany, 2003<br />Location: Facets cinemateque<br />Format: 35mm Theatrical<br />Company: Miriam<br />I'm really sad that this is over.  After sitting through 7 hours of this massive, insane artistic project, the Cremaster Cycle feels like Walt Disney.  This is by far Greenaway's biggest accomplishment, and even if he stops now the films alone hint at so many ideas and tangents that it's impossible to even make sense of it.  This third film definitely seemed a bit rushed however; it was exciting to see Compton Verney (and I'm surprised it played such a big role in the narrative) and the ending is reallly something (though I don't want to spoil it for people who may be reading this).  I definitely think this could have been 90 hours and I would have still watched it.  I found myself dissapointed that it ended so "quickly".  It may be the greatest ego trip ever to be constructed in the history of film or a breakthrough new frontier for art cinema.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 December 2004<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: Theatre room<br />Format: NTSC VHS, Full-<br />Company: Ben Allen<br />Laughed at for the first time: Veal Chop saying "Jamborees".<br /><br /><br /><br />7 December 2004<br />The Point<br />Fred Wolf, USA, 1971<br />Location: home<br />Format: DVD, full-frame<br />Company: none<br />Really enjoyable and not at all like the Alan Thicke-narrated version I saw on the Disney Channel as a kid and wanted to see again for years.  I liked the nonchalant speech of some of the people in the Pointed Village, and the overall resemblence to the Phantom Tollbooth (but since the Phantom Tollbooth movie is apparently terrible, this will have to suffice).<br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2004<br />Withnail &#38; I<br />Bruce Robinson, UK, 1987<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD, widescreen<br />Company: Robert<br />Glad to finally watch this with Robert.  I love buddy movies, and this one more than any other.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2004<br />Sweet Movie<br />Dusan Makavejev, Canada / France / West Germany, 1974<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: .AVI file on TV<br />Company: Robert<br />Great to see this again, in preparation for the forthcoming Mnemelish DVD release.  I think Rogert Ebert called this the greatest film ever made.  This may be true.  If the two sides of the film are capitalism and communism, then I think the moral is that capitalism leads to shitting in peoples mouths, and communism leads to killing children.  Which may also be true, I think.  Why aren't films like this made anymore?<br /><br /><br /><br />11 December 2004<br />Sweet Movie<br />Dusan Makavejev, Canada / France / West Germany, 1974<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: .AVI file on TV<br />Company: Pat, Eric, Brian Gore<br />Recorded commentary track.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2004<br />Cocksucker Blues<br />Robert Frank, USA, 1972<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD, full-frame<br />Company: none<br />Holy shit. I expected this to be fucked up, but I didn't think it would be as fucked up as this.  Far surpassing "Gimme Shelter" in showing the dark side of rock and roll, this has never been legally released for a reason.  While filled with sex and drugs, it's not a celebration of the rock and roll lifestyle at all, but a portayal of the misery and boredom of touring.  Jagger was certainly striving for a myth with his image at this time (and I think of "Performance" made just before this) and it's a dark, dionysian one that Frank captures.  The little concert footage is hot (especially the bit with Stevie Wonder) and the energy and passion shown there is totally undercut by the footage of Keith Richards nodding off backstage and Mick Jagger masturbating. <br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2004<br />Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, Le<br />Luis Bu&#241;uel, France / Italy / Spain, 1972<br />Location: Theater Room<br />Format: DVD, widescreen<br />Company: Eyes and Arms of Smoke<br />I love this film and I haven't watched it in about a year.  It's great to see with friends who have never seen it.  I really love the subtleties of the dialogue - pretty much every line is a mockery of the characters, but not always obviously.  And still, Bunuel does dream sequences better than any director ever.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2004<br />Mr. Freedom<br />William Klein, France, 1969<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD-R, widescre<br />Company: Robert for parts<br />Hilarious sendup of the cold war, with John Abbey brilliantly portraying the essence of Americanism.  This is like a film adaptation of the Uncle Sam character from Coover's The Public Burning only with terrible costumes, Delphine Seyrig and Serge Gainsbourg.  Robert and I were talking about how there aren't really films like this anymore - the sense of self-ridicule, antiestablisment humour and fuck-all dialogue.  There could never be a film like this, or Putney Swope or Sweet Movie today, because the culture is different and self-awareness just comes off as snarky these days.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 December 2004<br />Treed Murray<br />William Phillips, Canada, 2001<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: .avi file on TV<br />Company: none<br />Much more enjoyable than I thought it would be, though not as quirky as the description led me to believe.  At times this felt like a teenage, Canadian Straw Dogs but the excesses were welcome, and well-placed.  The film only really fails when it tries to become too heavy-handed and emotional, which only happens a few times.  Also good is how all of the characters are pretty unlikeable.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2004<br />The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 2004<br />Location: Galleria<br />Format: 35mm film<br />Company: none<br />Wow.  Holy shit.   I just got back from seeing this so of course I am all excited and warm and emotional because of it.  Wes Anderson is such a fucking genius.  This was every bit worth the wait and not disappointing at all, maybe his best movie though I have to see it like 8 more times before I can say for sure.  I was listening to "Life on Mars?" when I pulled into the parking lot of the theater; it's prominent feature in the film was pretty weird and another example of synchronicity in my life lately.  There's such a familiarity to his films now - the style, the sense of humour, the themes - that seeing a new one is sort of like discovering a long lost friend.  I can't wait to see this again.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2004<br />Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies Under America<br />Craig Baldwin, USA, 1992<br />Location: parents' Living Room<br />Format: DVD-R on HDTV<br />Company: none<br />I've been wanting to see this for a long time, and I was not disappointed.  A brilliant medley of conspiracy theory wrapped together in a way that both glorifies and mocks it, with clever stock footage and the perfect vibe of creepiness.  What's so amazing is that so much of the information is true, and it serves as a pretty cutting portrait of American foreign policy.  Also, nice special features and menus on this fine Edition Inkjet product.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2005<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: None<br />This is my new favorite movie.  I think a new year's resolution should be to see every film with Elliott Gould that I can possibly find.  I feel this is in a spiritual league with "Harold and Maude" and also the Wes Anderson ouevre.  Some parts were so funny I was almost crying, and  it's just the perfect type of absurdity.  Why is 1970's cinema so great?<br /><br /><br /><br />7 January 2005<br />The Plumber<br />Peter Weir, Australia, 1979<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX DVD rip wa<br />Company: none<br />I finished watching this film wondering why I bothered, but then I did watch it.  This contains the same tension and mystery as "Picnic at Hanging Rock" but without the moody mysticism of "The Last Wave".  For a made-for-TV movie it's great, as it continually tricks the viewer by sort of playing on horror film conventions - while it's anything but.  Perhaps it was just a bit too long, and too subtle in it's dynamics.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 January 2005<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Theater Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Ben Allen, Ellen, Robert<br />A second time through was no less rewarding.  It's great how this film keeps changing gears - beginning as an offbeat love story, then taking on a very serious turn, before descending into complete lunacy (while maintaining the same absurd humour through all parts).  Elliott Gould is amazing.  Vincent Gardenia is amazing.  Donald Sutherland is amazing.  I just ordered this on DVD - maybe I should watch it once per week.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 January 2005<br />Fant&#244;me de la libert&#233;, Le<br />Luis Bu&#241;uel, Italy / France, 1974<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: AVI VHS capture<br />Company: Ben Allen, Porter, Robert<br />I actually fell asleep before the end of this.  I haven't seen it in a few years and I enjoyed it, though maybe not as much as the first time because it was slow and the picture quality wasn't amazing on this VHS rip.  It's not as "hi-octane" as Discreet Charm, though still marvelously funny and with some twisted ideas. <br /><br /><br /><br />17 January 2005<br />Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade<br />Steven Spielberg, USA, 1989<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: bootleg Indian <br />Company: Irene, Ben Allen, his friend, Robert, Sakka, Ben Fulton for part<br />Hilariously ridiculous Indiana Jones adventure that I always regarded as the best of the three, though probably that award has to go to Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Sean Connery is pretty lackluster, actually, and I find myself continually thinking "This was the same guy that was in Zardoz???!!"  A fun time with the roomies....<br /><br /><br /><br />18 January 2005<br />Bob &#38; Carol &#38; Ted &#38; Alice<br />Paul Mazursky, USA, 1969<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI ripped<br />Company: none<br />This wasn't as funny as it could have been, but it actually explores the age of sexual freedom pretty well, with protganonists just on the wrong side of "old" in 1969.  The script was good and the characters are fully realized, but this isn't exactly something I would recommend as a classic of counterculture filmmaking.  Elliott Gould is approaching his peak though, younger here than in anything I've ever seen him in (and completely brilliant in a few scenes, like where he's eating peanuts and saying how he had an affair).<br /><br /><br /><br />22 January 2005<br />The Ipcress File<br />Sidney J. Furie, UK, 1965<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />While produced by Harry Saltzman of the James Bond empire, this is a different sort of spy film.  Michael Caine is brilliant as Harry Palmer, a sort of anti-James Bond.  He is nerdy, mired in bureaucracy, and hardly a reliable choice to save the world.  He makes mistakes, and is shown in such unglamorous activities as grocery shopping and cooking food in his apartment.  This is truly a spy movie, though - not an action film.  The plot is very tense, with lots of scenes of genuine espionage - people shuffling papers in the office and things that are actually quite dull.  The cinematography is brilliant - some very interesting camera angles (my favorite was thru the hi-hat of a drumset) add to the tension of the film.  While there is some Parallax/Manchurian Candidate mind-control stuff, it's pretty much a realistic, edgy film about trust and loyalty.  Now I have to track down the other two in the series.... <br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2005<br />Silver City<br />John Sayles, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Robert for parts<br />This is the most overtly political John Sayles film since "Matewan"; the closing moments were great, but a break from his trademark subtlety.  This isn't vastly different than anything he's ever made before, but it pulls together a lot of his themes.  Chris Cooper actually doesn't have a huge part in it, and his portrayal of W is so dead-on accurate I wonder if Sayles even had to "direct" him.  Thematically, the film deals with a lot of different ground - immigration, the environment, and what the role of journalism.  The flawed protagonist has to come to terms with his beliefs, and we see idealism fading in others with age and "maturity."  With so many characters and plotlines it again threatens to get lost under it's own weight, but Sayles is deft enough at only editing in the parts that matter and conveying his story in a direct manner.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2005<br />Carnal Knowledge<br />Mike Nichols, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Robert, Ben Allen<br />1971 was a hell of a year for Jules Feiffer.  Robert and I watched this hoping to see something as brilliantly absurd as "Little Murders"; this film, while very good, is a lot more subdued.  Feiffer really attacks the male psyche here, and it's great how miserable Jack Nicholson's character winds up.  There's an inherent sadness linked to sex here, and it reminds me of "Bob & Carol..." in that way.  Very funny at times, and Art Garfunkel is actually a pretty good actor.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2005<br />Gigantic<br />AJ Schnack, USA, 0<br />Location: John Ferguson's house<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />This focused on their early career enough that it was still enjoyable, and the early videos (most of which I had never seen before) were a great extra on the DVD.  Wow, TMBG sure suck now.  Wow, their fans are the biggest losers ever.  The girl who was openly weeping because she met them made me want to vomit.  But there's something brilliant about their early work, and the footage of them playing "Birdhouse on Your Soul" on the Tonight Show with the Tonight Show Band justifies the entire film.  Could have done without the "quirky" documentary parts.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 January 2005<br />Series 7: The Contenders<br />Daniel Minahan, USA, 2001<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI VHS ri<br />Company: none<br />Am I a horrible person because I think a teenage girl being bludgeoned to death in front of her parents is hilarious?  Reality TV parodies are pretty overdone, and not particularly difficult to do.  This one isn't a masterpiece of satire, but it is an amusing thriller in the vein of Battle Royale.  As a pointed statement, it's so obvious that I didn't really give a fuck.  But the reality TV style is spot-on, and there was something fun about this.  I'm sure if this was made in the 60's by someone like Peter Watkins, it would be amazing.  <br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2005<br />How Arnold Won the West<br />Alex Cooke, France / UK, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />A portrait of the political circus that was the California recall, done well with a sense of humour.  I can't believe I live in this country sometimes.  The film is of course not very flattering to Arnold but is really more about the political machinations of America and recent distrubing trends in the American electorate.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2005<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: The Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: John Ferguson<br />Three times in 30 days - I am so excessive.  John Ferguson was the perfect companion for this film, for it speaks to him very clearly.  <br /><br /><br /><br />7 February 2005<br />Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Stringing together a feature film entirely of outtakes is risky, and this film is obviously the same exact thing as Anchorman.  If you've already watched the Anchorman outtakes then you're not going to see much new.  It's funny how they try to pretend that it occcurs after Anchorman, when it's clearly the same thing.  But there are still some really great moments that I hadn't seen before that makes this worth watching at least once if you enjoyed the first film.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 February 2005<br />Petulia<br />Richard Lester, USA, 1968<br />Location: Ninth Rooom<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: none<br />I think I articulated my thoughts on this film in the "Petulia: A Personal Journey" short on the bootleg DVD I am making of this film, so I won't go any further here on PBT.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 February 2005<br />S*P*Y*S<br />Irvin Kershner, USA, 1974<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: none<br />The sheer pain experienced while watching this monstrosity is almost unequaled; I can only shake my head in sorrow at the sadness in seeing these two brilliant actors being murdered by this script.  Gould has flashes of brilliance, of course, but Sutherland actually seems like he's intentionally trying to act as badly as possible.  Maybe he was - maybe he had a vendetta against the studio, or the world at this point.  A Forgotten Yuk, forgotten for a reason.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2005<br />Joe Versus the Volcano<br />John Patrick Shanley, USA, 1990<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Ben Allen, Porter, Jeremy<br />If I saw this as a kid I barely remember it; watching it now it's delightful for it's offbeat sense of humour and young, innocent Tom Hanks (whom I normally do not like).  Ossie Davis and Abe Vigoda perhaps steal the show (oddly Ossie Davis just died a few days before I watched this, though I did not know it at the time).  The nonchalantness of the film (and the obvious low-budgetness of it) makes for a lighthearted good time.  Still not as good as The Burbs though.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 February 2005<br />Winter Kills<br />William Richert, USA, 1979<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />This is a film that I really can't figure out; I've seen it a few years ago and thought it was a limp conspiracy thriller with weird pacing and silly extravagances.  But watching it now, I realize that it's a total parody of conspiracy films, though it's not ha-ha funny and still very very strange in it's direction.  I plan to watch this again with director's commentary to figure out what the hell they were thinking when they made this film.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 February 2005<br />The Hunting of the President<br />Nickolas Perry / Harry Thomason, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I've never been a fan of Bill Clinton, but watching this actually made me respect the guy a lot more.  I never realized that he was up against such a vast conspiracy, that began even before he was elected.  Of cousre this film is partisan to a core, but I don't think it really distorted too much.  Watching this made me realize what an insanely right-wing country we live in - far more than I realized before (and I don't think that I am particularly naive).  I don't think a democrat will ever be elected president again - after the let 1992 slip by, they clearly resolved to do everything in their power to keep the white house in republican hands, like steal the 2000 election (and probably the 2004).  This country is pretty fucked.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 February 2005<br />V&#233;rit&#233;s et mensonges<br />Orson Welles, France / Iran / West Germany, 1974<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI record<br />Company: none<br />This is one of Robert Anton Wilson's favorite films, though it's not remembered fondly by Orson Welles scholars.  It's the last project of his career and certainly strange in comparison to his other work, but a really amazing look at authenticity in art.  The film is ostensibly about Clifford Irving and Elmyr de Hory, but it is also about Welles himself.  He later claimed that everything in the film was faked, and when you watch it, it's hard to know what to actually believe.  It definitely lies in league with Hugh Kenner's "The Counterfeiters" and Gaddis' "The Recognitions" in asking about the value of art and the individual.  <br /><br /><br /><br />10 March 2005<br />Seems Like Old Times<br />Jay Sandrich, USA, 1980<br />Location: Fail family living room<br />Format: digital cable b<br />Company: none<br />Lighthearted comedy written by Neil Simon that features Chevy Chase at the top of his game.  The story is basic but well-played, and builds to a ridiculous conclusion.  Charles Grodin is always delightful as well, and this was fun though it never went totally over the top, where it could have achieved greatness.  Not nearly as good as "Fletch", of course, and it suffers from too much cuteness, but Chase's performance is good enough to make it through.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 March 2005<br />S*P*Y*S<br />Irvin Kershner, USA, 1974<br />Location: Adam and Lori's<br />Format: choppy final cu<br />Company: Adam and Lori<br />Watching this a second time was sort of painful, even though I wasn't really paying attention or listening to it.  Adam and Lori were good sports for nailing the commentary track, even though it's not going to be a particularly good commentary track.  <br /><br /><br /><br />15 March 2005<br />Amen.<br />Costa-Gavras, France / Germany / Romania, 2002<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: widescreen DVD <br />Company: none<br />I loved this film - this type of quirky humour totally speaks to me.  I'm not that well-read on the philosophical ideas behind the characters, but it didn't really matter.  The whole film was sort of a pisstake on that stuff, but also had a bit more depth than I think most people realized.  It's intelligent and funny, and had some great performances - and for a mainstream movie it avoided being dumbed down, even if it wrapped everything in a post-modern smirk.  <br /><br /><br /><br />21 March 2005<br />I Heart Huckabees<br />David O. Russell, USA / Germany, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />This is a really interesting film that doesn't offer easy answers.  It's a condemnation of the Catholic church for their complicity in the holocaust, but on a deeper level it's a film about how well-intentioned people get caught up in terrible things.  Gerstein, the "hero" of the film, is a genuinely sympathetic character for an SS officer, and Ulrich Tukur's performance is incredible.  But the fact remains that he aided in genocide, and it's presented to us in a manner that is comprehensible.  The cinematography is beautiful and works well with the slow pacing.  Overall it's a film about the systems that man creates, and how group thinking can overcome reason and morals.  And the Catholic Church is hardly surprising in their actions, but of course I am extremely cynical. <br /><br /><br /><br />27 March 2005<br />Dark Days<br />Marc Singer, USA, 2000<br />Location: Ninth Room and wrk<br />Format: DVD watched on <br />Company: none<br />This documentary about life in the Amtrak tunnels under New York is pretty harrowing at times, a remarkable picture of desperation.  It's like a real-life 'Dhalgren' and it's amazing how these people are resouceful and survive.  There are parts that are amusing, and parts that are disturbing - and it's done in a pretty non-judgemental manner, without seeming preachy.  The grainy black and white 16mm stock is perfect, and the amateur approach to filmmaking is part of the charm. It seems like a lot of the people are exaggerating their behavior at times, but when you realize that the filmmaker was living among with them, it makes a lot of sense.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 March 2005<br />Jandek on Corwood<br />Chad Freidrichs, USA, 2003<br />Location: WORK<br />Format: AVI watched on <br />Company: none<br />I think this film tends to be reviled by Jandek fans, and I can see why - it draws attention to him which is probably unnecessary, and no one in the film really has anything worthwhile to say.  What made it enjoyable for me was the music.  I've never really listened to Jandek before, but now I am much more curious - of course the film certainly highlighted the best Jandek work, but the soundtrack was fantastic and I'm going to sit down and listen to all 40 albums eventually.  Also, the phone conversation from 1985 at the end of the film makes the whole first hour worth sitting through.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 April 2005<br />Primer<br />Shane Carruth, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: AVI watched str<br />Company: none<br />Wow!  This film was made for $7000 and was one of the most entertaining sci-fi films I've ever seen.  I couldn't make heads or tails of it, and I have to watch it at least 3 more times to figure out what happened.  Highly recommended.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 April 2005<br />Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine<br />Vikram Jayanti, Canada / UK, 2003<br />Location: work<br />Format: AVI watched on <br />Company: none<br />Movies about chess are certain to be dull; this one was definitely low on the excitement meter, but it was at least saved by it's sinister overtones.  The filmmaker strongly suggests a conspiracy by IBM and a human element in the Deep Blue program; IBM people are in the film and probably didn't know it was going to be so pointed when it was made.  I found this enjoyable enough as something to watch at work, though I would never watch it again - it's interesting how the film actually makes me really empathize for Kasparov.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 April 2005<br />Neil Young: Human Highway<br />Dean Stockwell / Neil Young, USA, 1982<br />Location: work<br />Format: DVD watched on <br />Company: none<br />I was burning a copy of this for Luke and I sat through the whole film again, only with our commentary on.  It's actually pretty funny if you catch all of the references, but maybe I've fallen into that trap of thinking my inside jokes are incredibly funny when they're really not to anyone else.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 April 2005<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD watched on <br />Company: Monica<br />It was great watching this with Monica.  That part where Elliot Gould gives the monologue about people reading his mail totally kills me, especailly the line about "You should never challenge a system unless you are completely at peace with what might happen" (or whatever it is).  <br /><br /><br /><br />12 April 2005<br />The Ladykillers<br />Ethan Coen / Joel Coen, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: AVI on TV, stre<br />Company: none<br />The Coen Brothers sadly lack the cleverness that makes their earlier films so remarkable - it's like they've just given up, and lost sight of what made them great.  Their sense of humour remains intact, and there were a few parts during this film where I laughed out loud.  The cinematography/art direction was beautiful, but the script just lacked panache; the characters were so silly and exaggerated that it became little more than a cartoon.  Even lesser works like "Raising Arizona" and "Hudsucker Proxy" had this maverick sense to them that made the overall picture overcome it's narrative limitations; here, it's just a good but unexceptional comedy and feels like their hearts aren't in it anymore. <br /><br /><br /><br />13 April 2005<br />Primer<br />Shane Carruth, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: AVI on TV, stre<br />Company: Robert, Sakka, Katja<br />Robert had to leave four minutes before the end and Irene got drunk, so I'm probably the only person who got anything out of this viewing, my second.  I'm still pretty unclear on the "chronology" but I totally enjoyed watching this again, especially with others.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 April 2005<br />The Yes Men<br />Dan Ollman / Sarah Price / Chris Smith, USA, 2003<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />A pretty amusing portrait of some political-oriented pranksters that succeeds because they aren't overly cocky in their behavior.  They seem like pretty honest guys who are just fortunate enough to pull off some amazing pranks, and the delivery is largely successful.  The filmmaker tries to suggest that their actions helped lead to problems in trade negotiations in 2003, which I think is a bit far-fetched - but the spirit of creative anarchy is pervasive here, which I greatly enjoy. <br /><br /><br /><br />1 May 2005<br />The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy<br />Garth Jennings, USA / UK, 2005<br />Location: Lexington Green<br />Format: 35mm film in th<br />Company: none<br />If this movie came out ten years ago, I would have shit myself with happiness.  I nearly did anyway.  I loved these books so much in high school that Tim Howe and I used to quote them to each other constantly, and make little props from the books.  At one point we were trying to memorize the whole book and I could recite the first page verbatim.  The film didn't disappoint - the dialogue was almost exactly from the books and the casting was brilliant - with Sam Rockwell as a overdone Zaphod and Stephen Fry narrating, and Tim from The Office as the perfect Arthur Dent.  The CGI was great too - the film wasn't reliant on it, like most films these days are, but it was a nice step up from the old BBC series.  This makes me want to re-read all of the books.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 May 2005<br />Sideways<br />Alexander Payne, USA, 2004<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />I'd watch Veal Chop in just about anything, but this highly acclaimed screenplay seemed like little more than a teen buddy movie with two characters trying to get laid, although it took itself more seriously.  But after it ended, I found myself rather appreciative, mostly for it's continual depressing qualities.  Middle-age is a good topic for a downer movie, and these guys don't seem to have a light at the end of the tunnel.  Plus it's made me more interested in drinking wine.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 May 2005<br />Popeye<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1980<br />Location: Trevor and Sara's<br />Format: VHS tape on TV<br />Company: Irene, Jason, Sakka, Sara, Trevor, Ellen, Robert, Daryl<br />I'm not sure why we were so excited to rent this, but it was surprisingly great.  Robert Altman, since he's the most brilliant American film director ever (in my opinion), can pretty much take anything any make it interesting.  This is another deconstruction of a genre, in this case the children's film, done in his usual style with overlapping dialogue, loosely improvised acting and a totally messy story.  The music is equally fucked up, as Nilsson apparently lost interest in writing lyrics and just winds up repeating things over and over.  It's hard to explain what makes this a glorious mess instead of just a pile of shit, but it works.  It's made me curious to investigate other Altman films that I haven't seen, as painful as they may look.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 May 2005<br />&#191;Qui&#233;n puede matar a un ni&#241;o?<br />Narciso Ib&#225;&#241;ez Serrador, Spain, 1976<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />An ugly film about a difficult topic that raises some questions- namely, that of the title. But also, it's a horror film that relies on standard horror conventions when necessary.  It was a bit too slow to be "fun" but I'm glad I saw this - I would recommend it to those with twisted minds.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 May 2005<br />Shattered Glass<br />Billy Ray, USA / Canada, 2003<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I guess I'm a nerd for liking films about journalism and advertising so much.  This one told an interesting tale, I suppose, but the main character's bad acting was the big problem.  I did like how the film played with the notion of who was the good guy and the bad guy the whole time (though ultimately I thought that Chuck Lane came across as the "best" character).  Journalism has bigger problems than Stephen Glass, though.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 May 2005<br />Catch-22<br />Mike Nichols, USA, 1970<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I've never read the novel, but this film version was unbelievable.  Incredibly cynical, but hilarious, and with absurdly great acting by Alan Arkin, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.  The bleakness of the scenarios made the humour even more biting, and the upsetting moments are really truly upsetting.  This is like the bad illegitimate brother of M*A*S*H.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 May 2005<br />Out of the Past<br />Jacques Tourneur, USA, 1947<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Perhaps the definitive film noir ever?  Tournier's use of shadows is incredible in this film.  They're in every scene, day or night, indoor or outdoor.  Robert Mitchum is tight as hell, here playing the protagonist to Kirk Douglas's baddie.  The dialogue is CLASSIC - every single line is exactly perfect for this type of movie.  Beautiful.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 May 2005<br />A Day Without a Mexican<br />Sergio Arau, USA / Mexico / Spain, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />A poorly executed idea that had the production values of a made-for-TV movie.  And I certainly would have enjoyed it if it was on TV, but instead it was a pretty dismal time.  A few comedic moments were surprisingly clever, but I couldn't help feel that it was aimed at a much younger audience.  The political subtext -  well, it's not that "sub" I guess - was pretty simple and offered no great insights.  Apart from making me hungry for a burrito, I don't think there was much value to this.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 May 2005<br />Gray's Anatomy<br />Steven Soderbergh, UK / USA, 1996<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />John Ferguson has recommended Spalding Gray to me, and as I've never read him (beyond the first few chapters of Impossible Vacation) and I like Soderbergh, I checked this out.  Essentially a monologue of Gray at a table talking abut an eye injury, this was really enjoyable, especially cause I could lay down and mostly listen.  Soderbergh made a lot of efforts to spice up the film, with stylized lighting and intercut interviews with other victims of eye injuries.  Gray's personal monologues are amusing, neurotic but honest, and clever without being quirky.  <br /><br /><br /><br />25 May 2005<br />Hypoth&#232;se du tableau vol&#233;, L'<br />Raoul Ruiz, France, 1979<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI VHS ri<br />Company: none<br />I was slightly disappointed by this, though it had a lot to do with my mental state while watching this.  This early Ruiz film is highly influenced by Resnais/Robbe-Grillet, and bears many similarities to the early Peter Greenaway documentaries.  Basically two narrations about a series of paintings by an unnamed artist, this is all about the mysteries in art and is full of ambiguity and game-playing.  So on paper, it looks like something I would love.  While I appreciated it, it was just a little bit too dry, and I daresay "difficult" for me.  It lacked the humour and ambition of Greenaway's work, but it also lacked the humanity of Resnais.  As an intellectual exercise, this is a fascinating film (and I must watch some more Ruiz work).  I just don't think I would be excited to sit down and watch it again.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 May 2005<br />The Return of Captain Invincible<br />Philippe Mora, Australia, 1983<br />Location: Theater Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: Irene, Porter, Minter<br />The goofball sense of humour kept me going through this, though I had to fight the urge to doze off at times.  I think this was made by the guy who made Rocky Horror, and like that, there are tons of bad songs. Luckily the zany humour of Alan Arkin kept me going through this.  It sorta reminded me of Leonard Part 6 at times.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 May 2005<br />Husbands<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1970<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX DVD rip? W<br />Company: none<br />Stunning!  As a film about male relationships, this is unparalled.  Ben Gazzara is completely incredible, and while this isn't always comfortable to watch, it's incredibly real in the way it portrays human emotions.  Plus, it's actually funny (though I am realizing that no Cassavetes film is simply a "comedy" or "drama").<br /><br /><br /><br />31 May 2005<br />Three Kings<br />David O. Russell, USA / Australia, 1999<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />A very powerful film that is good at mixing black humour with war atrocities.  I've never been one for war films but this and Catch-22 make a busy month for me.  Clever and edgy in that Fight Club way, but with a very distinctive visual look and some really interesting ideas.  This film is excellent in the way it deals with complex issues, and maintains a fierce political edge without being preachy.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 May 2005<br />Melinda and Melinda<br />Woody Allen, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I don't think there was any redeeming quality to this.  Woody Allen keeps making films despite having absolutely nothing to say.  Will Farrell provided a few chuckles, just basically playing Woody, and the "point" of this film was so simpleminded that I would expect a 16 year old to have written it.  There is nothing clever here, little that is funny, and the ending is so unsatisfying that I want those two hours of my life back.  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 June 2005<br />Over the Edge<br />Jonathan Kaplan, USA, 1979<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI VHS ri<br />Company: none<br />This is gonna have to come out on Mnemelish, so I can use the Wipers as the music.  This is the best juvenile deliquent movie ever made.  When it escalates into violence, it just feels so good!  Intelligent, and non-exploitative, and with some great young actors, this is really a lost gem.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 June 2005<br />Punishment Park<br />Peter Watkins, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Much more powerful and disturbing than I ever imagined it would be.  At long last I finally watch Punishment Park and I'm amazed at how much it affected me.  It's incredibly bleak, and the feeling is intensified by the faux-documentary approach.  Plus, given the current political situation, this isn't too far off.  Despite being completely over the top in it's premise, and saturated in seventies political paranoia, I found this almost as chilling as Titicut Follies in seeing the darkness of humanity on screen.  An incredible attack on power, and very even-handed in it's treatment of people, this is really a warning against the tyranny of ideology from either side.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2005<br />Historias m&#237;nimas<br />Carlos Sorin, Argentina / Spain, 2002<br />Location: work<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I didn't enjoy this much at all.  It was pleasant, in that Fellini/"Amarcord" way, but without much visual flair and without the benefit of 20 years of film critics proclaiming it's greatness (which is why I liked "Amarcord," I guess - that and the soundtrack).  It had zero conflict and was just a set of simple stories (as the title proclaims) about small town Argentinians.  I wouldn't watch this again.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 June 2005<br />The Spook Who Sat by the Door<br />Ivan Dixon, USA, 1973<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Most of this film unfolds in a very somber manner, which makes it all the more exciting when the violence erupts at the end.  The scenes where the militant black radicals are shooting the National Guard are as exciting as any action movie, yet it's charged by early 70's racial politics.  Despite the low-budget origins of this film, it's presented very well.  Every white character in the film is portrayed as a racist out to smash African-American uprisings, and the hero of the film is unwavering in his devotion.  While it's very much a "product of it's time" (like most things I seem to watch), it's an exhilarating one.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 June 2005<br />The Stunt Man<br />Richard Rush, USA, 1980<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Another weird film that took some sinking in before I could decide how I truly felt about it: wow.  This is a remarkable film - it plays with the audience, and asks questions about the nature of cinema, belief, and guilt - and Peter O'Toole is totally over the top.  This was actually made in the 70's but it has that weird 80's gloss to it that I'm trying to figure out.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 June 2005<br />Flirting with Disaster<br />David O. Russell, USA, 1996<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />For a Hollywood comedy I enjoyed this quite a lot - Russell shows that he is a formidable talent even with weak actors and a pretty conventional approach.  There were enough goofy twists and absurd moments to make this entertaining, though it's of course not as edgy as "Three Kings" or as brainy as "Huckabees".<br /><br /><br /><br />11 June 2005<br />Jigoku k&#244;shien<br />Y&#251;dai Yamaguchi, Japan, 2003<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />I have no real excuse for sitting through this except that I wanted to watch something dumb.  This was like a Japanese troma film, aimed at nine-year olds and super violent, but not that violent.  I think the Happiness of the Katakuris did a better job at this type of wacky Japanese humour, plus it was a lot more artistic.  But this was about baseball, after all.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 June 2005<br />California Split<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1974<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: DVD on projecto<br />Company: Jeremy, Robert<br />One of the greatest American films of the 70's, and it looks great on DVD (despite the poor projector bulb).  I'm glad I saw this again.  Elliott Gould's best performance?  <br /><br /><br /><br />13 June 2005<br />Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?<br />Mike Nichols, USA, 1966<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />Mike Nichols' first film is masterfully made, with stark Haskell Wexler photography and top-notch performances.  The subjects of this film are like a trainwreck that you can't tear your eyes away from; over the nearly real-time unfolding of the narrative, I felt their exhaustion and pain yet I still wanted it to go on.  The banter between Burton and Taylor is so incredibly pointed that it's painful - the attacks are so honest and passionate at the same time, that it's really hard to take if you've ever been in a relationship like that (and I have been).  At first I felt it was exaggerated, but by the end I was so powerfully affected in that way you feel when you realize a local experience is much more universal than you thought.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 June 2005<br />Leningrad Cowboys Go America<br />Aki Kaurism&#228;ki, Finland / Sweden, 1989<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />The humour in this is so deadpan and the performances of the Finnish actors are so silly that it's hard not to love this film.  In addition to being charming, it's actually quite funny in a goofball way (with lots of sight gags), and the view of America it portrays is not your standard one.  It's a real testament to the allure of America's smaller corners to foreigners.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 June 2005<br />Big Trouble<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1986<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />The last Cassavetes film, and one that is disowned by many of his fans.  This was really bizarre - the offbeat humour works well with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk, but it didn't feel like a Cassavetes film at all (cause it probably wasn't, really).  On it's own, it's an enjoyable Coen bros.-esque comedy; when viewed as a Cassavetes film it becomes very strange and perplexing.  <br /><br /><br /><br />16 June 2005<br />First Monday in October<br />Ronald Neame, USA, 1981<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Walter Matthau is even more likeable in this Ronald Neame film than he is in Hopscotch; here he plays a liberal Supreme Court justice who butts heads with a female appointee.  This is an adapatation of a play, and has little in the way of action - the best parts of the film are the lengthy debates the two justices have.  I rather liked this, but I like Walter Matthau and US politics a lot, so...<br /><br /><br /><br />17 June 2005<br />The Hot Rock<br />Peter Yates, USA, 1972<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Fun jewel heist/caper film in that 70's vein.  Robert Redford is really intense in this, and the screenplay is by William Goldman, which plenty of twists and a light humour to it all.  The best part is the helicopter sequence, which actually made me nervous to watch.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 June 2005<br />The Day of the Jackal<br />Fred Zinnemann, UK / France, 1973<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DIVX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />This was a great thriller because of the way it paid attention to details.  There was absolutely no moralizing, and neither side was portrayed as the "good guys" or "bad guys".  Despite the outcome being clear from before the movie started (just from knowing history) it kept me watching with rapt attention.  There was such a calm proceeding to the film, and I think that it worked really well as a mystery that explained both sides of the story completely and left no mystery to the imagination.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 June 2005<br />Wrong Is Right<br />Richard Brooks, USA, 1982<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />This is a very odd, troublesome film, but I think in retrospect it was brilliant despite its flaws.  It's very ahead of it's time in terms of satire and accuracy, and funny but not over the top, so it's just sort of odd.  The only times when it fails is when it becomes an action film, but it's a lot like "Winter Kills" in that it's got that early 80's feel that is just sorta "off" and you can't quite put your finger on what is so strange about it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />29 June 2005<br />Fletch<br />Michael Ritchie, USA, 1985<br />Location: Theater room<br />Format: VHS on projecto<br />Company: Robert, Jeremy, Minter<br />I think watching this annually should be a requirement for my life.  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 July 2005<br />Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2004<br />Location: Ann Wilkinson's apartment<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: Donna, Ann<br />Gets funnier every time!<br /><br /><br /><br />2 July 2005<br />Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life<br />Tom McLoughlin, USA, 2005<br />Location: Ashworth Tap Room<br />Format: AVI on TV<br />Company: Spencer<br />I skipped out of work a few hours early to drive to Cincinnati, and a router went down after I left, and my coworker had to come in on his day off to fix it because I wasn't there.  I was actually too busy watching a made-for-Lifetime channel movie about Internet porn addiction  (in another city) to do my job.  This film had a few good moments.  I really liked how the director worked within the limitations of not being able to show nudity, and took the preachy puritanical view.  This could also be seen as a film about parental pressure.  This can also be seen as a new low in what I do with my free time.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 July 2005<br />Lip Service<br />William H. Macy, USA, 1988<br />Location: Ashworth Tap Room<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Larry Pilloughs, Dave Crapo, Tommy<br />This is a film about how they make TV.  Larry was in good form, and Tommy showed up later but he had put down 16 tall light beers from Applebees so he was a little bit, er, blurry.  Dave held it all together the best he could, but you could tell he was a little agitated at Larry's stuttering and Tommy's drunkeness.  I didn't pay attention to even a minute of this film.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 July 2005<br />Stella Shorts 1998-2002<br />Michael Ian Black / Michael Showalter / David Wain, USA, 2002<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Ann<br />Fun to watch this with her; her sense of humour seems very Stella-compliant.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 July 2005<br />A Woman Under the Influence<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1974<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Devastating! (in the best possible way)  Seeing this definitely gives me a fuller understanding of Cassavetes.  I am really drawn to his approach to narrative, with the improvisatory style but not too free.  If "Husbands" explores the male psyche, this perhaps could be called "Wives".  Gena Rowlands gives such a powerful performance that it's painful to watch, and Peter Falk creates a very complex character in two and a half hours.  This is rather horrifying in that Joseph Heller "Something Happened" manner; I don't think i would want to watch this all the time for kicks, but I recognize it as a masterpiece.  My mother said this film has stayed with her ever since she watched it in the 70's.  <br /><br /><br /><br />23 July 2005<br />Minnie and Moskowitz<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />This is somewhat lighter fare from Cassavetes, and has an unusually focused ending, but was still a powerful emotional film.  The characters were more lighthearted than the typical Cassavetes characters, yet their strong acting performances convey a complexity.  There's a lot of weird interactions in this film that make it seem almost fantasy-based, but then not; and Cassel is really great as the sort of flawed protagonist.  <br /><br /><br /><br />31 July 2005<br />The God Who Wasn't There<br />Brian Flemming, USA, 2005<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Ann<br />What a terrible, stupid film, yet somewhat enjoyable.  This was if Michael Moore made a film about theology, except with bad house music and cheesy screensaver graphics. What is this guy's deal anyway?  I felt like taking down Christianity when I was 13 years old, but I've since matured.  I realize he's an ex-believer who is horrified at his past, but making a film like this seems an extreme way to deal with it.  I laughed a lot but I wish he would have explored more of the historical questions concerning Jesus' existence.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2005<br />That Sinking Feeling<br />Bill Forsyth, UK, 1980<br />Location: Downstairs<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Thom<br />Man? talk about a disappointment.  All this talk about Local Hero makes me want to see it again.  This film doesn't make me want to see it.  There's a bit of that Bill Forsyth charm, but the majority of the humour falls very flat, and it seemed like a nice idea for a student short stretched way too long.  I did laugh a few times but I didn't even pay attention after the first twenty minutes.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 August 2005<br />Rollercoaster<br />James Goldstone, USA, 1977<br />Location: Ann's/Ninth Room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: Ann<br />Great 70's diaster flick with a moustached George Segal as the everyman bureaucrat who has to disarm a terrorist bent on blowing up a rollercoaster.  Segal feasts on the weak script and some of the camera movements were total trompe l'oeil.  Even though Sparks appears in this film, they play all songs from Big Beat and you can barely see Ron.  <br /><br /><br /><br />24 August 2005<br />The 40 Year Old Virgin<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2005<br />Location: Theater off Winchester road<br />Format: 35mm film proje<br />Company: Ann<br />Ann paid for me.  This was a masterpiece in successful comedy - warm and touching, yet not too sappy, and genuinely funny in the most wonderful obscene ways.  It manages to be a "guy" film without ever descending into bigotry or homophobia (even the "I know you're gay because" part isn't really gay-bashing, per se) and Steve Carrell shows many more dimensions than I ever thought was possible with him.  I think I may have liked it even more than Anchorman!<br /><br /><br /><br />24 August 2005<br />Stupidity<br />Albert Nerenberg, Canada, 2003<br />Location: Ninth room<br />Format: DivX AVI tv bro<br />Company: Ann<br />Terrible documentary about "stupidity", which is really not that necessary.  I didn't even pay that much attention to it, and the end was actually cut off in the DivX file.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 August 2005<br />The Kentucky Fried Movie<br />John Landis, USA, 1977<br />Location: Ann's<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Robert, Ellen, Ann, Alyssa<br />It's been awhile since I've seen this but strangely none of the Kentuckians have ever seen it before.  Not that it's actually about Kentucky.  I LOVE the part where there are the drunk men who don't know where they are and don't care, and the drunk men who don't know where they are but DO care, and the men who care, know where they are but don't drink.  Or whatever.  And the capital of Nebraska is Lincoln.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 August 2005<br />Bright Leaves<br />Ross McElwee, USA / UK, 2003<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Ann<br />The master of the rambling, unfocused documentary returns with a look at the tobacco fortunes of North Carolina 100 years ago, specifically how his family just missed becoming the richest family in America (and the Gary Cooper film that was allegedly based on his great-grandfather).  Like his earlier films, he's unafraid to drag his relatives and friends into the frame, but his gentle voice and thoughts carry no scent of indulgence.  As he's a bit older than when he made "Sherman's March" and "Time Indefinite," he's a bit more reserved, and actually stays on-topic for most of the film.  It turns into an exploration of smoking-related illnesses and smoking culture at times, but never gets too preachy.  The sloppy yet crisp landscapes of North Carolina add to the beauty of this film, and by the end I was sad that McElwee has made so few films.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 September 2005<br />The Aristocrats<br />Paul Provenza, USA, 2005<br />Location: Cinci theater near Amol<br />Format: 35mm film proje<br />Company: Ann, Spencer<br />Any film that takes vulgarity to such a level is A-OK in my book.  Though the pacing dragged at times and the film was very poorly made, there were enough dirty jokes to keep me laughing throughout.  I think Bob Saget was my favorite, but I also really enjoyed Taylor Negron, George Carlin and Whoopi Goldberg.  Jesus, I can't believe I just typed that.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 September 2005<br />Love and Death<br />Woody Allen, France / USA, 1975<br />Location: Ninth Room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Ann<br />I didn't pay full attention to this film, which I haven't seen in a few years.  This is one of my favorite Woody Allen films - perhaps the presumption that he is Russian is funny enough to last through the whole film, I don't know.  Diane Keaton is at her best here, I think.  <br /><br /><br /><br />6 September 2005<br />Drowning by Numbers<br />Peter Greenaway, UK / Netherlands, 1988<br />Location: Ann's<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Ann<br />Ann's never seen any Greenaway so I thought I would recommend this, which I've always felt is his warmest and most human film.  I didn't watch the very end but I've seen it enough times anyway.  Watching this on VHS is killing me - I've never really truly seen it, as a bunch of the number count #s are actually cut off.  Will this ever see the DVD release it deserves?<br /><br /><br /><br />10 September 2005<br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<br />Terry Gilliam, USA, 1998<br />Location: Kentucky<br />Format: 35mm film<br />Company: Ann<br />While I've seen this multiple times on video, I've never seen it on a big screen before.  And it made a lot of difference - the camera movements and general psychedelic effects made it really hard for me to watch this.  I was also extremely tired, and I dozed off at parts, but the sensations experienced by the characters translated well to my physical self.  This is a film that never lets up, not from the minute it starts, and it's very much a masterpiece.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 September 2005<br />Modern Problems<br />Ken Shapiro, USA, 1981<br />Location: Garrioch bedroom<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Why was this turd released on DVD while so many gems remain unreleased?  This is the only film I've ever seen Chevy Chase in where he plays a different character - this time, a genuinely "nice" guy, though the horrendous plot and humour made it hard to even finish watching.  Dabney Coleman sort of steals the show, though even he gets tiring by the end, and the racist, caricatured black Haitian actress made this especially painful.  Never again!<br /><br /><br /><br />16 September 2005<br />The Laughing Policeman<br />Stuart Rosenberg, USA, 1973<br />Location: Garrioch bedroom<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />Walter Matthau is completely without a comic side in this film, which I believe is the only film I have ever seen him not even be slightly funny.  Bruce Dern plays his oddball partner, whose mannerisms are extremely eccentric, and the high point of the film.  This is a very gritty 70's cop film, with a rather uninteresting mystery at the core that isn't the focal point anyway - rather the interactions between the two veteran detectives, and the dark vision of the American streets.  Some of the sound mixing reminds me of "Petulia" or Robert Altman's best work.  I would probably think this film was "amazing" if I watched it again.  <br /><br /><br /><br />17 September 2005<br />The Last Great Wilderness<br />David Mackenzie, UK / Denmark, 2002<br />Location: Garrioch sitting room<br />Format: PAL VHS on TV<br />Company: Luke, Anna<br />Luke was excited about this lackluster Scottish thriller because the producers asked him for consulting advice on RD Lang; he didn't get credited, nor did there seem to be much depth to the Wicker Man-esque "therapy" retreat that provided the film's horrific setting.  The violence doesn't occur until the very end, but the buildup fails to achieve the release that I think the filmmakers were looking for; the depiction of Skye as a backwoods hippie commune was interesting, but ultimately not enough to drive this film.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 September 2005<br />Love Streams<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1984<br />Location: back room<br />Format: DivX AVI watche<br />Company: none<br />Cassavetes final film (not counting Big Trouble) takes a few departures, most notably some dream sequences.  But the core of his filmmaking is present - a strong emphasis on emotion and a gritty portrayal of two screwed up characters.  Watching the real-life husband and wife team interact as siblings is spooky, and as both of them deepen into middle age it becomes more hauntingly autobiographical than any of his other works.  Like everything else I've seen by Cassavetes, I found this emotionally challenging and fascinating. <br /><br /><br /><br />27 September 2005<br />No Direction Home: Bob Dylan<br />Martin Scorsese, USA / UK / Japan, 2005<br />Location: Luke's house and Luke's mom's house<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: Luke and Bridget (on separate evenings)<br />Scorcese musta been working on this for a long time, as the Seeger and Ginsburg interview footage proves.  As a casual Dylan fan, I found this quite inspiring, amazing even.  By sticking with pre-'67 material Scorcese manages to pack a lot into 3.5 hours.  Dylan is unusually candid discussing his upbringing, though he still stays coy enough to keep a cloud of mystery around the "real" Dylan.  Of course he's extremely overstudied and self-invented for the most part, but his complexity comes across in the clearest I've ever seen it.  And even if you aren't really a fan, some of the live footage is so amazing that it will make a believer out of anyone.  After I watched this I spent the next few days humming Dylan songs and wanting to get an acoustic guitar and strum my own chords.  Fantastic!<br /><br /><br /><br />27 September 2005<br />Sydney<br />Paul Thomas Anderson, USA, 1996<br />Location: back room<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: none<br />The first PT Anderson film is compelling by Phillip Baker Hall's character alone, though by the end the film breaks down into a standard 90's noir type thing.  Anderson is at his best when he is being mysterious, which is why I liked the ambiguous Punch Drunk Love so much and didn't care for Boogie Nights.  The Samuel Jackson character is so overwrought and as the film went on I found myself less and less interested.  The beginning is quite good however and really sets up the picture for something it doesn't deliver on.  <br /><br /><br /><br />30 September 2005<br />Ber&#246;ringen<br />Ingmar Bergman, Sweden / USA, 1971<br />Location: back room<br />Format: DivX AVI VHS ri<br />Company: none<br />I'm not sure if I saw the entirety of this film as the AVI file ends suddenly; I think so, as it appeared to be wrapping up.  Casting Elliott Gould in a Bergman film is almost a perverse idea, as he has to restrain his natural comedic gifts - it was akin to watching Matthau in The Laughing Policeman last week.  This lacks the severity of the other Bergman films I've seen but still manages to be compelling, mostly through Gould's tortured performance.  A few scenes are so visceral they made me uncomfortable, and the relatively conventional narrative worked as a canvas for these characters to express their feelings.  It's certainly not my favourite Elliott Gould performance but it's definitely one of the most unique.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 October 2005<br />Funeral in Berlin<br />Guy Hamilton, UK, 1966<br />Location: downstairs room at Garrioch<br />Format: DivX AVI TV rip<br />Company: none<br />The second Harry Palmer film is much better than the first one (though I really loved the first one).  Caine's character has developed a lot more cockyness, and he isn't quite so much the bureaucrat, but this is certainly a spy movie of the best kind.  The plot is much more straight than the goofy brain-control plot of The Ipcress File and by sticking to cold, hard spy material the film really succeeds.  The portrait of Berlin as ravaged by the divide is quite chilling, and this would make an interesting double feature with Possession.  Now to try and find the third film in this series...<br /><br /><br /><br />8 October 2005<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Luke's<br />Format: DivX AVI DVD ri<br />Company: Luke<br />It was nice to see this with Luke, thus making it another friend with whom I have shared this experience.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 October 2005<br />The Trials of Henry Kissinger<br />Eugene Jarecki, USA / UK / Denmark / France / Canada / Australia, 2002<br />Location: bedroom in Finnieston<br />Format: DivX watched on<br />Company: none<br />Excellent documentary about the monster that is Henry Kissinger.  I knew most of the information in this film already due to seeing Hitchens speak, but the film was so well-constructed that I enjoyed it anyway.  Seeing all of the old footage was really powerful and I think it made an excellent case.  There's really not even much room to criticise the information in here - it was solid, non-speculative, and maybe Michael Moore should see it so he can understand what a proper political film should be like.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 November 2005<br />Head<br />Bob Rafelson, USA, 1968<br />Location: Ben's<br />Format: DivX Avi on TV <br />Company: Ben, Kirstie, Giles, Susan, Duncan <br />This is the first time I've seen it in years, and it was every bit as funny and head-scratching as always.  The music in this mostly kicks ass, and is definitely the best work the Monkees ever did.  I'm not sure how this fits into the whole lineage of the surrealist film, the rock and roll film, the counterculture film - perhaps because of it's unique stars, it keeps a foot outside of all of these categories and stands alone.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 November 2005<br />Swimming to Cambodia<br />Jonathan Demme, USA, 1987<br />Location: lounge<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: none<br />Spalding Gray's most well-known work is a fantastic monologue about his experiences in Thailand working on "The Killing Fields".  It's quite funny at points, and of course quite honest, and a few things resonated with me in terms of trying to find that "perfect moment" when you're in another country.  Giles told me this is his all-time favorite film which I found shocking, since I didn't think a man sitting at a desk seemed like an appropriate subject for a favorite film, but now I see his point.  The film, while only using a few lighting tricks, cuts and background music, accentuates Gray's relationship with his audience and illustrates the power of storytelling.  Great stuff.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2005<br />The 40 Year Old Virgin<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2005<br />Location: lounge<br />Format: bootleg AVI on <br />Company: Roxanne<br />Second time through was just as funny, despite the few annoying sound dropouts from the bootleg I downloaded.  Just after watching this, I got a job at PC World, which is exactly like the job the characters in this film work at. <br /><br /><br /><br />9 November 2005<br />Victory Through Air Power<br />Perce Pearce / James Algar / Clyde Geronimi / Jack Kinney / H.C. Potter, USA, 1943<br />Location: Dr. Pascoe's office<br />Format: DVD on computer<br />Company: "Writing the Disaster" seminar<br />I enjoyed this more than I thought I would - Disney's Technicolor vision of World War II was quite funny at points, and I can only imagine Churchill and Eisenhower watching this together as they allegedly did.  The early sequences portraying the history of aviation were actually great Disney humour, especially with the German and English pilots throwing bricks at each other.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 November 2005<br />Me and You and Everyone We Know<br />Miranda July, USA / UK, 2005<br />Location: American Crescent<br />Format: DivX AVI watche<br />Company: none<br />I pretty much hated this film - it was the worst type of quirky indie romance with stupid cute games, but trying to be meaningful through weird metaphors and strange humour.  I laughed at the sex jokes that involved children though, because I am sick and have a fucked up sense of humour.  Otherwise this was Napoleon Dynamite for people a few years older. <br /><br /><br /><br />16 November 2005<br />Slaughterhouse-Five<br />George Roy Hill, USA, 1972<br />Location: Pascoe's office<br />Format: DVD on monitor<br />Company: "Writing the Disaster" seminar<br />I haven't seen this in ages so it was nice to see it again (likewise reading the book was enjoyable for the first time in almost a decade).  It's too bad the actor who played Billy Pilgrim never went on to do anything else notable.  I did notice during this film a distinct image of a swinging lighbulb during the actual Dresden bombings, which I think is a direct reference to Picasso's Guernica.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 November 2005<br />Monster in a Box<br />Nick Broomfield, UK / USA, 1992<br />Location: Giles's living room<br />Format: VHS on TV<br />Company: Giles<br />I think Giles feels this is the weakest of the Spalding Gray film monologues, but I enjoyed it a lot - perhaps because I've been watching/listening to a lot of Spalding Gray lately, so maybe I'm just familiar with him now and reaching the point where I really love what he is saying.  I thought this would be a lot heavier, talking about his mother's suicide, or even about the writer's block in dealing with it, but if anything it only glossed on these topics and discussed the situations around his life while he was writing.  There is a sadness evident underneath the humour, and though it didn't end with quite as much of a mystical weirdness as "Swimming to Cambodia" had, it's was still totally great and enjoyable all the way through.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 November 2005<br />Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb<br />Stanley Kubrick, UK, 1964<br />Location: Pascoe's office<br />Format: DVD on monitor<br />Company: "Writing the Disaster" seminar<br />I missed the beginning but I have seen this quite a few times.  I love George C Scott and Sterling Hayden, and I think that their performances actually outweigh Peter Sellers in this, though maybe I'm just biased.  I forgot how long and repetitive the pre-bomb airplane scenes are, but Pascoe went into a talk about repetition and clich? as a device so I suppose that's what he was talking about.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 December 2005<br />Hiroshima mon amour<br />Alain Resnais, France / Japan, 1959<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />Watched with commentary track while taking five pages of notes for the presentation I have to give Wednesday.  The commentary track is brilliant - it gave me a lot of insight into some of the themes and symbolism, and I can't wait til II give my presentation.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 December 2005<br />Hiroshima mon amour<br />Alain Resnais, France / Japan, 1959<br />Location: Pascoe's office<br />Format: DVD on monitor<br />Company: "Writing the Disaster" seminar<br />Watching this again in just a few times time is exhausting, especially without a break.  Resnais's true time-game is probably the way he manages to make a 90 minute film feel like ten hours.  Of course I think this is one of the most briliant films ever made, so it's worth the hard work.  I followed this with a presentation about the themes of memory, the body, place, and the cycle of rebirth and destruction.  We also watched "La Jet?e" which I won't list here cause I don't list shorts, but it is also brilliant.    The presentation went very well.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 December 2005<br />March or Die<br />Dick Richards, UK, 1977<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: AVI DVD rip on <br />Company: none<br />What a crap film.  I have no idea why I rented this from Netflix many months ago - probably because it looked like an interesting Gene Hackman 70's vehicle.  There were pretty few redeeming qualities, if any - absolutely shit performances from Hackman, Catherine Deneuve, and Max Von Sydow and a highly Islamophobic narative are actually the high points of this turkey.  No wonder Edward Said wrote Orientalism. Oh yeah - this was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer,.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 December 2005<br />Interview with the Assassin<br />Neil Burger, USA, 2002<br />Location: Garrioch living room<br />Format: DivX AVI watche<br />Company: none<br />Second-rate conspiracy film that pretends to be a documentary about the gunman from the Grassy Knoll.  I always love Kennedy material so this was promising, but bad acting and some very boring segments made this tedious.  The plot turned out the way I hoped it did, so it serves as a good anti-conspiracy nerd film even though it caters to those people.  <br /><br /><br /><br />27 December 2005<br />Ovoce stromu rajsk&#253;ch j&#237;me<br />Vera Chytilov&#225;, Czechoslovakia / Belgium, 1970<br />Location: Garrioch living room<br />Format: DVD rip on TV v<br />Company: none<br />Robert was right about this and I'm sorry it took me so long to get around to seeing it!  I really must watch "Daisies" again, as it's been years.  The opening fifteen minutes of this film are among the most splendid visual delights that I have ever seen.  The narrative section of the film was loopy, and I don't know if I "got" it all, but it reminded me of Richard Brautigan's "In Watermelon Sugar" which I want to re-read now.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 December 2005<br />The Graduate<br />Mike Nichols, USA, 1967<br />Location: Garrioch living room<br />Format: DVD rip on TV v<br />Company: none<br />To round out the year with the first four Mike Nichols films I watched this, which I haven't seen since I was a lot younger.  I think this is the weakest of the four films but it's still a classic - it's just that the Simon and Garfunkel music gets pretty annoying after awhile.  <br /><br /><br /><br />12 January 2006<br />Good Night, and Good Luck.<br />George Clooney, USA / UK / France / Japan, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />There's no way you can't enjoy a film about sticking it to McCarthy, especially with David Straithairn in the lead role.  Perhaps he will finally get the Oscar he deserves.  The film is pretty propagandistic, heroizing Murrow and Clooney's characters; also, it struggled to fill 90 minutes, having to add a completely superfluous plot with Robert Downey Jr. - I honestly can't think of any film that has a more obviously irrelevant subplot.  Still, I enjoyed this.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 January 2006<br />I Heart Huckabees<br />David O. Russell, USA / Germany, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel<br />I still think this film is quite funny - Marky Mark's character is a great send-up of lifestyle politics, and the alternative Huckabees commercial is total Monty Python.  Russell continues to impress me, as this held up to a second viewing.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 January 2006<br />Targets<br />Peter Bogdanovich, USA, 1968<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This isn't as trashy as I expected.  Fun, despite some slow moments.  The first sniper scene is brilliantly paced; truly a classic.  The Boris Karloff stuff was obviously tacked on but Bogdanovich and Polly Platt found a way to pull it together somehow, not that it really even mattered by the end.  <br /><br /><br /><br />19 January 2006<br />London<br />Patrick Keiller, UK, 1994<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />My favorite film of the year, so far, although it was made 12 years ago.  As a journal of 1992 in London, it works well, but it really goes far beyond that, incorporating a lot of ideas about space, urbanity, and politics.  It's one of the most obvious love/hate relationships ever filmed, and stylistically it resembles those early Greenaway films that I love so dearly.   Amazing!<br /><br /><br /><br />20 January 2006<br />Billion Dollar Brain<br />Ken Russell, UK, 1967<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Ken Russell directed the third, weakest Harry Palmer film.  It's much closer to a James Bond film, with a ridiculously cartoonish supervillian, though he wasn't even that evil, totally over the top in all of the wrong places.  The story was pretty convoluted and I actually found myself struggling to follow it - but with no payoff.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 January 2006<br />Putney Swope<br />Robert Downey Sr., USA, 1969<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Luke, Anna<br />Ah, these Scottish folk didn't get it.  To me, this is one of the funniest films ever made, certainly near the top of my all-time favorites.  Maybe they're afraid to laugh at racial jokes, though I must admit I was pretty perplexed the first time I saw this.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 January 2006<br />Robinson in Space<br />Patrick Keiller, UK, 1997<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />An interesting thing about perception is how interrelated themes will appear in your life, but only if you are looking for them.  Just after a seminar on postmodern space and a re-reading of Perec's "Species of Space" I watched this, which was a stunning continuation from the methods started in London, only perhaps less politicized.  This is something I think I will watch again and again.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2006<br />Waydowntown<br />Gary Burns, Canada, 2000<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />An independent Canadian film that reminded me of Office Space crossed with Treed Murray - sorta stupid, not great, yet strangely entertaining.  This was actually pretty dark at points and in the middle became pretty confusing, in a good way.  The conclusion left a bit to be desired, but this woulda been a great made for TV movie, and would probably stand up well as a study of postmodern space.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2006<br />Hell House<br />George Ratliff, USA, 2001<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />It's easy to make fun of conservative Christians, but this film restrained itself from doing so, though obviously it was made by young hipster filmmakers with a decidedly non-Christian agenda.  As fucked up as Hell House is, by the end of the film I was slightly bored and the dynamics of the people behind the scenes took over from the shock of the actual house.  The father with the epileptic baby was fascinating though - one of those documentary characters who seems just too real.  Nice music by the Bedhead bros.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 January 2006<br />Why We Fight<br />Eugene Jarecki, USA / <br />France / <br />UK / <br />Canada / <br />Denmark, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Solid documentary with some great footage, even if it seems unsure whether it's an attack on the Iraq war or a study of the buildup of the military-industrial complex and post-1948 US foreign policy.  Actually it's both, while perhaps it should have just been the latter, but it was put together well, and rarely bothered to push emotional buttons.  And while it was very clear of it's opinion, it gave Richard Perle and William Kristol a chance to speak as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 February 2006<br />Jigureul jikyeora!<br />Joon-Hwan Jang, South Korea, 2003<br />Location: my room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Bustling, aggressive, and schizophrenic - undeniably fun, though, and so visually dazzling that it overcame the silly plot twists and genre switching.  I think that new Asian cinema really pulls its influences from a lot of different camps - in this film, I noticed a distinct influence of Argento and Italian giallo, especially in the bumblebee scene, which was the most remarkable point of the film for me.  This was tons of fun, if extended torture sequences are your bag.  And the ending rivals "Dead or Alive" 1.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 February 2006<br />Hoop Dreams<br />Steve James, USA, 1994<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />To relieve the tension during Super Bowl Sunday while I was waiting for the STEELERS to come on TV and win one for the thumb, I tried to find a film that was about sports to get in the mood.  This documentary is everything it's cracked up to be - a riveting portrait of inner city youngsters with a dream to hit it big.  Of course it's got it's depressing moments, but the content is extremely powerful, and despite the lack of a unique style I really enjoyed this.  Perhaps the best thing to me was seeing inner city American high school life in the early 90's, which I don't think I've ever seen depicted on film before but of course it was something I lived through.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 February 2006<br />Neil Young: Human Highway<br />Dean Stockwell / Neil Young, USA, 1982<br />Location: Ben's<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Ben, Kirstie, Arttu<br />At this point I feel like I have seen this film more times than anyone else in the world, including the people who made it, but there are probably diehard Neil fans who have watched it more.  The painful parts become less painful each time, which is scary.  I think I still find the weird nonsense parts fascinating, like the scene with the milkman and the sheik, though they are probably just nonsense.  It was fun to watch this with Neil Young fans.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 February 2006<br />The Mothman Prophecies<br />Mark Pellington, USA, 2002<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: none<br />I bought this at a charity shop for ?2 cause I knew it was filmed in Pittsburgh, and I was feeling homesick.  It's actuallly a fairly entertaining supernatural-themed film. Filmed in places like Kittaning, it really captured the feel of small-town Rust belt life, which of course I hold very dear to me.  It perhaps portrayed the people as a bit too simple, but I wasn't really expecting much.  Also, Richard Gere is what you get if you cross David Schwimmer with Jon Stewart.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 February 2006<br />The Girl from Monday<br />Hal Hartley, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Oddly, I enjoyed this new Hal Hartley film - certainly more than anything he's done since Simple Men except maybe for Henry Fool.  I think his obsession with Godard works well in an overtly sci-fi story (which resembled La Jete? a bit); I don't know why he is so enamored of playing with cheesy presets on digital video, but it worked better here than in his other stuff.  Yeah, it's kinda dumb, but I guess I went into it with low expectations.  It was miles above that last one with the monster, certainly.  Hartley dealing with sexuality this overtly is a bit weird, but again, weird worked this time.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 February 2006<br />Vertigo<br />Alfred Hitchcock, USA, 1958<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: Rex, Lisandra, Sam<br />Viewed in preparation for the "New Women" seminar, I can't help but find vaginal doorway shapes all around James Stewart's emasculated character; his only act of heroism in the film turns out to be false, and at the end when he appears to be back in control the nun arrives and he's stripped once again of his manhood.  Plus, he opens the film wearing a corset.  Though there are some slow moments in the middle (and Kim Novak isn't that great), this is a fantastic film, made stronger by it's unconventional twists and the overt themes of sexual dysfunction and necrophilia.  <br /><br /><br /><br />27 February 2006<br />The California Reich<br />Keith Critchlow / Walter F. Parkes, USA, 1975<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />Disturbing as much as Louis Theroux's visits to contemporary American Nazi clans, this film also shows young racist children and thus is most compelling at these times.  The lead Nazi's cries about loneliness and victimization, while obviously misguided, infuse this with a more human side that I expected.  America can be a very dark place.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 February 2006<br />Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment<br />Karel Reisz, UK, 1966<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Zany, madcap sixties romp that doesn't shy away from class issues, though it reduces Morgan's Communist obsessions to misunderstood hero-worship.  Great editing that unfortunately reminds me of Benny Hill; this is a classic though and truly the ancestor for quirky romantic films that are so popular among directors today.  David Warner has a great style and Redgrave is explosive.  I'm really glad Luke recommended this.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 March 2006<br />Schizopolis<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 1996<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />Andrew Radford and I were talking about Soderbergh and he dissed this film; this was the one that made me interested in him and it was good watching it again.  The best parts are brilliantly funny, and certainly carry the film -- the more exaggerated quirky humour falls flat but is easy to ignore, appearing mostly as short interludes.  If Godard had made this in the 60's, it would probably be universally considered brilliant.  Actually, a lot of Schizopolis  reminded me of Weekend, perhaps more conceptually/stylistically.  I think the destruction of narrative is commendable, and the repeating scenes with variations of language, while stereotypically post-modern, serve as a metafictional device akin to Queneau's Exercises in Style.  This film deals with the psychological issues of mid-90's American mundanity better than any other, I think, and it's funny too.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 March 2006<br />Bubble<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />Very impressive low-budget HD mystery.  Soderbergh is so interesting - here he takes non-actors, shoots a film in their actual houses, and makes an absolutely beautiful, low-key film that perfectly captures life in small-town West Virginia.  Besides my obvious regional enjoyment this worked really well because of the way it deals with the plot.  It's not actually a mystery, because there is no mystery - just the desire of understanding, the lack of affect and strange, misunderstood emotions.  I don't think the film is patronizing to the Ohio valley at all - it's quite genuine, perhaps a bit washed out to complement the dolls of the factory, and actually quite real.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 March 2006<br />Husbands<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1970<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Taking notes on this for a paper on masculinity, I realized how amazing this film is.  I can't think of another film that presents such a complex vision of masculinity.  Of course, I'm not sure that I can completely work out what that vision is - I guess unraveling it through the filter of theory is what I have to do for this paper.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 March 2006<br />A Constant Forge<br />Charles Kiselyak, USA, 2000<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I didn't actually like this documentary much - it was pretty unorganized, and for some reason only really focused on a few films while barely even mentioning Husbands or Love Streams, which seem to be the most pivotal films to the study of Cassavetes.  The worst thing was that the documentary was 3 hours and 15 minutes long, which was just insane.  The interviews with Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk were very worthwhile, but everything was broken up so much that it became hard to tell what was going on.  The archival footage of JC on the sets was certainly amazing, but I could have done without the cryptic poetry intertitles.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 March 2006<br />23<br />Hans-Christian Schmid, Germany, 1998<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />The story of some computer hackers from the Chaos Computer Club in Hanover - told in a narrative constructed around the protagonists's obsession with the Illuminatus Trilogy.  Also featuring a cameo from Robert Anton Wilson playing himself.  This wasn't great - had a TV movie feel - but it definitely took me back to high school days where I woulda loved this film.  Entertaining, not too long, and had some great vintage computer equipment.  At least the protagonists learns not to get too wrapped up in conspiracy theory - which most of Wilson's readers don't seem to get.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 April 2006<br />Gloria<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1980<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Cassavetes wrote this to make some money and wound up directing it pretty much by accident.  It feels like the inverse to The Killing of a Chinese Bookie - rather than a Cassavetes take on a film noir, it's a gangster movie take on a Cassavetes movie.  This was really well-paced and fun to watch, though certainly not up to the standards of his other work.  I especially liked how Pittsburgh played this prominent role in the ending as an elevated heaven they were trying to get to (though I don't think they actually filmed any of it there).  I won't incorporate anything from this into my paper but I'm glad I've seen it now.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 April 2006<br />The Squid and the Whale<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />Noah Baumbach maybe has surpassed Wes Anderson with this film.  It was very painful and very funny at the same time, which is a recipe for enjoyment.  Jeff Daniels is quite moving in this and it had just the right resonance with my life, without crossing into dangerous "indie film" territory.  Wow.  <br /><br /><br /><br />2 April 2006<br />Sherman's March<br />Ross McElwee, USA, 1986<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />I thought it would be nice to finish off this 4-film day with this epic documentary, a fave of mine.  I really want to see Time Indefinite again after re-watching this.  There are parts of this film that just make me go "awwww", like whenever he gets desperate and films himself whining at the camera, or the beautiful shots of the moon over which he talks about his fear of nuclear war.  I could probably make my own version of this film based on the past few months here in Glasgow.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 April 2006<br />Safe<br />Todd Haynes, UK / USA, 1995<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This is a very low-key film about "environmental illness".  It's one of the coldest, most clinical pictures I have ever seen - almost every shot is a long shot or medium, so there is no emotional interaction with the protagonist.  This is one of the most overtly feminist films I've ever seen by a male auteur, falling under H?l?ne Cixous' definition of ?criture feminine through the way it deals with female physicality and space.  The only down spot for me is that I'm still not very impressed by Julienne Moore.  But this was very interesting.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 April 2006<br />Syriana<br />Stephen Gaghan, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I found this very confusing, an elliptical ensemble film that intentionally kept any sort of connections from coming together.  And I think I liked it most because of that, not because it was confusing for the sake of strangeness but because that emphasized the political connections involved with oil, the middle east, and terrorism. Also, this was the best performance I've ever seen from George Clooney, whom I usually don't think is anything special.  This had the feel of a John Sayles film, only significantly heavier and obviously bigger budget.  Very good.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 April 2006<br />The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!<br />David Zucker, USA, 1988<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: Daniel<br />I bought this for ?1 from a charity shop in Partick.  This is a good film - actually this is a great film.  I love stupid comedy.  "Nice beaver" is one of the best jokes ever.  Leslie Nielsen is a treasure to America and one of the few celebrities I would genuinely love to meet.  It was a blast back to my early adolescence, watching this over and over with Mike Watson.  Hopefully I won't start re-watching the Police Academy series next.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 April 2006<br />The Naked Gun 2&#189;: The Smell of Fear<br />David Zucker, USA, 1991<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: Daniel<br />I bought this for ?1 from a charity shop in Partick.  Richard Griffiths is pretty funny in this, and a lot of the scenes I loved as a child I remembered fondly, like the part where OJ gets stuck under the bus and is dragged to Detroit.  No, it's not as good as the first one, but a lot better than the third.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 April 2006<br />My Name Is Albert Ayler<br />Kasper Collin, Sweden, 2005<br />Location: CCA<br />Format: digital project<br />Company: Subcurrent masses<br />This biopic was fairly straightforward, and really didn't teach me anything new about Ayler.  The little bits of live footage that Kaspar was able to find were quite illuminating, but the real pleasure of this film for me was hearing the music through the giant PA system in the theater. Also, Sunny Murray was completely hilarious whenever he was speaking.  It's such a different approach than, say, Luke's film, which dealt with the legacy of the composer without resorting to mythologizing.  As amazing as Ayler's music was, there were times when this film seemed to lose sight of the music and focus on the myth a bit too often.  The audio footage of Coltrane's funeral was completely amazing though.  I certainly enjoyed this but perhaps I wish it was a bit more adventurous. <br /><br /><br /><br />4 May 2006<br />Harold and Maude<br />Hal Ashby, USA, 1971<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />I haven't seen this in years and it was absolutely wonderful to watch it again.  The Cat Stevens soundtrack has been getting some airplay in my room lately so it's nice to see it in the proper context.  I don't know if I heard "Morning is Broken" in it.  I've become much more of an afficianado of 70's American cinema since the last time I saw this, so I think I enjoyed it even more because it *looked* like so many other films I love.  Don't be shy, just let your feelings roll on by.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2006<br />My Dinner with Andre<br />Louis Malle, USA, 1981<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />A simple, and often parodied film, but it's famous for a good reason.  I'm not sure how much of the conversation was scripted - I'm sure that each actor's comments reflect their own views and personality.  Shawn seems more cynical, but with a streak of passion to him underneath the neuroses.  Gregory, despite seeming to be wide-eyed and free from anxiety, is actually perhaps the more pessimistic and trapped.  While I've never had any interest in theatre, the two actor's approaches to their art have similarities with my own situations in music, writing, anything really.  It's actually a pretty dense film, so I feel like I should watch it again to take in all of the ideas.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2006<br />Stalker<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, West Germany / Soviet Union, 1979<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX (projected<br />Company: none<br />I haven't seen this in awhile so I watched it again, since I am planning to structure lots of my dissertation around it.  There's something so incredibly haunting about this film, and it's difficult to put it into words.  My dissertation is going to be about invisibility and unarticulated catastrophe, and "Stalker" does an incredible job at being scary through absence.  The "meat grinder" is just a tunnel, and the room full of sand is actually frightening despite the lack of any physical threat.  The Zone is constantly shifting, but rather than being disorienting, it's familiar.  Projected on the wall, it's even more striking in its strangeness.  I will certainly watch this again and take notes, but this time I had to just lie back and let it overtake me.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 May 2006<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX (projected<br />Company: Daniel<br />It gets better every time.  Especially on the projector.  I think Daniel fell asleep, which is too bad, because this film is amazing.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 May 2006<br />Last Night<br />Don McKellar, Canada / France, 1998<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />Recommended by Andy Beckerman as something that might apply to my dissertation topic.  I enjoyed this Canadian end-of-the-world film, which left the cause for the end unexplained  It was fairly lighthearted (and a bit more accomplished than "Miracle Mile"), mostly addressing how people interact with others when their time is limited.  I guess I'm a bit more interested in the effects after the disaster, and there was no "after" here, but I still had fun watching this.  A few parts were actually quite funny in a bleak way, and it seems typical that Canadians would mostly just roll over and wait for it to happen in a civil manner.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 May 2006<br />Dog Day Afternoon<br />Sidney Lumet, USA, 1975<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel<br />70's film classic with Al Pacino pulling out all the stops.  This is successful because it stays pretty humorous throughout while still being gripping.  Some of Lumet's humour that's evident in Network shines through here, such as the critique of the media and celebrity.  The homosexual element is a great inversion of the Hollywood hero, and you can really see how this is the blueprint for pretty much every Coen brothers film.  <br /><br /><br /><br />20 May 2006<br />The Devil and Daniel Johnston<br />Jeff Feuerzeig, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Wow!  I've never been a Daniel Johnston fan before but this film is amazing!  The footage of him live in Texas in the mid-80s before things started to go bad is quite powerful.  The scenes of his childhood and his artwork brought tears to my eyes.  And when it all started to go bad, it's hard not to watch, like a fascinating trainwreck.  This makes me want to re-evaluate at least his first two tapes.. and in a weird way inspires me to be more creative myself.  Fantastic!<br /><br /><br /><br />21 May 2006<br />Skidoo<br />Otto Preminger, USA, 1968<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX (projected<br />Company: Kate, Stefan, Daniel, Ben<br />First Garrioch film night was a bit of a bust attendance-wise but the film was pretty great!  Preminger was out of his goddam mind with this one, but it holds up remarkable well.  The Nilsson soundtrack is pretty absurd, especially the end credits; Jackie Gleason's acid trip is stunning and the hippiesploitation, while of course awkwardly dated, it funny.  There's a bit of the anarchy of Head or Putney Swope but tied together a little bit more cleanly. <br /><br /><br /><br />22 May 2006<br />Penn &#38; Teller Get Killed<br />Arthur Penn, USA, 1989<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />23 May 2006<br />Bowling for Columbine<br />Michael Moore, Canada / USA / Germany, 2002<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV<br />Company: none<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />26 May 2006<br />The Jerk<br />Carl Reiner, USA, 1979<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />26 May 2006<br />Duck Soup<br />Leo McCarey, USA, 1933<br />Location: living room/bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I've only ever seen clips of the Marx bros before but I think I should see more.  Their influence on comedy is pretty great and it's still incredibly funny today.  The sense of anarchy in their humour appeals to me a lot - there seems to be a reckless misanthrophy underneath everything.  <br /><br /><br /><br />27 May 2006<br />The Man with Two Brains<br />Carl Reiner, USA, 1983<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />29 May 2006<br />Cach&#233;<br />Michael Haneke, France / Austria / Germany / Italy, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Very edgy, creepy and ultimately very disturbing through it's low-keyness.  This reminds me a lot of the Vanishing, in the way it uses ambiguity and the way it has a French male protagonist mishandling the situation.  The lack of music kept the film from being warm, and I wasn't sure where my sympathies lie.  There's more mystery to this film than appears on the surface, but the real subtext is racism, evident throughout without being overt.  Fantastic.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 May 2006<br />The Adventures of Bob &#38; Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew<br />Rick Moranis / Dave Thomas, Canada / USA, 1983<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />The film spinoff of the SCTV sketch is pretty crap: it doesn't make any sense at all, and the Bob and Doug McKenzie characters work better in the shorter "Great White North" segments.  However, a few moments are actually quite funny.  You get the "great" actor Paul Dooley (star of such gems as OC and Stiggs, Popeye, and Big Trouble) paired with Max von Sydow (who truly has the most eclectic filmography in history) as the baddies.  You get a bunch of hockey jokes, and some ludicrously stupid animal jokes.  And you get the knowledge that after the 90 minutes are up, you never have to see it again, which is strangely rewarding.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2006<br />Zerkalo<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1975<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Perplexing, personal narrative with time-shifts and stunning, unforgettable imagery.  This is something I will have to watch again to fully comprehend.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 June 2006<br />Offret<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, Sweden / UK / France, 1986<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Tarkovsky's last film finds him in Sweden,  <br /><br /><br /><br />1 July 2006<br />Solyaris<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1972<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3 July 2006<br />Man on the Moon<br />Milos Forman, UK / Germany / Japan / USA, 1999<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: none<br />A decent biopic that I put off seeing for years because I didn't see how it could do justice to Andy Kaufmann - I suppose it does the best it can, but having seen the original performances of most of the material, it just sort of made me wish I was watching Kaufmann himself.  While overall it's somewhat lightweight and forgettable, I guess it turned a lot of people onto him - whether that's good or not, I dunno.  I like how it suggests that the death may have been faked, though I doubt it.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 July 2006<br />Andrey Rublyov<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1966<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />Tarkovsky's famous epic surprised me - I didn't realize it was split into episodes, thus the grand narrative seemed a bit weakened.  And while this is much less daring than his later films, there is still an incredibly beauty to every composition, and the search for moral clarity as portrayed in the struggles of Andrei, Kirill and the other artists.  The battle scenes were surprisingly exciting, and the ending montage gives a good sense of closure to an otherwise uneven biopic.  <br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2006<br />Protocols of Zion<br />Marc Levin, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room/bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Documentary on the rise of anti-Semitism in America after 9/11 that starts out as an investigation int the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  I'm interested in the history of this text but he doesn't dwell on it long, and moves on to interviews with contemporary Americans.  This isn't great, but there were a few parts that impressed me - mostly the sections where he is debating/engaging with extremists.  I don't need to convinced that anti-Semitism is bad, but I suppose he has unearthed a pretty disturbing current of it.  He starts to touch on the difficulty of being anti-Zionist but not anti-Semitic in the eyes of the media, but doesn't follow it that much.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 July 2006<br />Stalker<br />Andrei Tarkovsky, West Germany / Soviet Union, 1979<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD/DivX<br />Company: none<br />Another viewing, taking more notes.  Not like I mind!<br /><br /><br /><br />21 July 2006<br />The Anderson Tapes<br />Sidney Lumet, USA, 1971<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Fantastic 70's crime caper - can be seen as the blueprint for Dog Day Afternoon, only not nearly as funny.  The cast is great - Connery is just weird, Martin Balsam plays a homosexual, Christopher Walken shines in his first role, you get Garret Morris, Conrad Bain, Val Avery from Cassavetes films, and best of all, Sidney from Putney Swope!!!  The focus on surveillance is done well, with creepy electronic music, predating The Conversation (which of course is a different class of film).  The ending is superb as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 July 2006<br />Zizek!<br />Astra Taylor, USA / Canada, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Documentary on Slavoj Zizek that focuses mostly on his personality and celebrity despite trying to convey his ideas.  I found the film generally hard to follow, though enjoyable enough because all you really have to do is turn the camera on him and let him go.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 July 2006<br />The Aristocrats<br />Paul Provenza, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Daniel<br />A second viewing makes me notice the annoying, sloppy aspects of this documentary more, but I wasn't watching this because I was seeking a masterful documentary film, but rather because I wanted to laugh my tits off.  Which I did.  Saget is still the best, I think.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 July 2006<br />Bedazzled<br />Stanley Donen, UK, 1967<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: Daniel<br />Clarence Manuelo was yelling at me that I need to see this for Peter Cook's musical number, which is amazing and completely where Scott Walker got his recent schtick.  I should have seen this a long time ago because it's extremely funny; there are so many layers of double entendres that it's hard to know when to stop laughing.  Not that there's any need to. <br /><br /><br /><br />29 July 2006<br />Horse Feathers<br />Norman Z. McLeod, USA, 1932<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: Daniel<br />I think I possibly enjoyed this more than Duck Soup.  <br /><br /><br /><br />30 July 2006<br />Primer<br />Shane Carruth, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Sinead<br />This is the third time I've seen it, but I really like this film.  It's everything it promises and more.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 July 2006<br />Duck Soup<br />Leo McCarey, USA, 1933<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: none<br />I guess FilmFour is showing all Marx Brothers stuff (Monkey Business is on tomorrow).  Which is fine by me!  Harpo's work with the scissors is brilliant in this.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 July 2006<br />Zero Effect<br />Jake Kasdan, USA, 1998<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Slightly offbeat mystery with Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller that seems unsure of what type of film it's trying to be.  At times it's a goofy comedy and at other points it?s a mystery and at others a romance, yet it doesn't commit to anything and subsequently feels a bit underdone.  Ben Stiller is pretty mediocre in this and a major detriment to the film; Pullman has his moments but is not one of my favorite actors.  Still, I actually enjoyed the mystery element.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 July 2006<br />Monkey Business<br />Norman Z. McLeod, USA, 1931<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: Daniel, Peter<br />Film Four's Marx Brothers series continues.  This one seems even crazier than the others, as the first hour is just the Marx Bros running around on a boat causing trouble.  I don't think their characters even have names.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2006<br />Mr. Arkadin<br />Orson Welles, France / Spain / Switzerland, 1955<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Brilliant and forgotten Orson Welles film that succeeds despite it's convoluted plot, exaggerated stereotypes and terrible lead acting from Robert Arden.  Welles' interest in simulacra and false facades that he develops more in F For Fake are evident here; the film revolves around a thrilling plot and travels around the world with all of the usual Wellesian angles and trademarks.  Introducing Arkadin under a mask, and then lifting it to show Welles under a big fake beard and moustache is a great joke.  And maybe I've read too much Robert Anton Wilson but I noticed that Arden's hotel room is #23.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 August 2006<br />Jackass: The Movie<br />Jeff Tremaine, USA, 2002<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: Daniel, Matthew<br />Way funnier than I remembered.  I actually wish there was a sequel.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 August 2006<br />99 and 44/100% Dead<br />John Frankenheimer, USA, 1974<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Bizarre and actually pretty awful 70's action gangster film.  It's a complete comic book approach - bad guy with a prosthetic arm, mob boss with a speech impediment, cartoonish action sequences and terrible diagloue.  The opening sequence showing cemented shoed bodies underwater is stunning; after that, the film is all downhill.  Richard Harris pulls off a decent American accent, and as an oddity in the career of Frankheimer (and the story of 70's American film) it's a curious, slightly guilty pleasure. <br /><br /><br /><br />7 August 2006<br />C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America<br />Kevin Willmott, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />A good premise - like Series 7: The Contenders, this film pretends to be a television broadcast in an America where the South won the civil war.  It's a bit of What if-- history that starts to wear quickly; luckily they punctuate the film with a bunch of fake racist commericals, which are shocking and funny (and could be quite evil if taken out of context).<br /><br /><br /><br />7 August 2006<br />The 40 Year Old Virgin<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Dougie, Daniel<br />Dougie fancied something fun and there's not much more fun than The 40 Year Old Virgin.  Still as funny as the first time I saw it.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2006<br />We Jam Econo: The Story of the Minutemen<br />Tim Irwin, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />As documentaries go, this wasn't so hot - I didn't learn anything new about the Minutemen, it was focused far too much on their discography, and it had too many talking heads saying how great they were.  I didn't really get a good feel for how they developed beyond the discography - no sense of how often they toured or how their relationship changed.  But the live footage is so amazing that it justifies the film; having never seen any video of them before, I was stunned at how powerful the songs came off live. Few artists in the history of music had careers as perfect as the Minutemen; I am tempted to get the DVD to enjoy even more live footage as extras.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 August 2006<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Edinburgh filmhouse<br />Format: 35mm film<br />Company: Warwick, Roxanne, Giles, Manuela, Malcy, Tom Sander, Shellmix, Kitmix<br />Going with a large group of people was fun, though the print was a mess and my DVD actually looks a good deal better.  I haven't gotten tired of this year, and seeing it on a big screen finally was worth the trip.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 August 2006<br />Volver<br />Pedro Almod&#243;var, Spain, 2006<br />Location: Grosvenor theatre<br />Format: 35mm film<br />Company: Thom War, Tom Sander, Shellmix, Giles, Vivian<br />Almod?var's very highly acclaimed drama was nicely shot, carefully plotted, and just a bit boring.  Predictability is no reason to dislike a film, but I fear I won't remember anything about it a few weeks from now.  Susan Berridge said from a feminist viewpoint she thought it was an incredible film, and while I apprecitae a male director who can create such a genuine feminine work, it doesn't have anything to make me excited about it as a work of art.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 September 2006<br />Simple Men<br />Hal Hartley, Italy / UK / USA, 1992<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I am incredibly fond of this film.  Hartley's weird wooden direction, overdramatic use of music and contrived wit should make me dislike this film, but I love it.  What I think is most successful is how he gives Long Island this mystical reverence - perhaps through filming it in Texas.  Hartley has never done better and never will.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 September 2006<br />The Odessa File<br />Ronald Neame, UK / West Germany, 1974<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Interesting thriller with a good premise - that a secret network exists to protect former SS officers in post-war Germany.  Jon Voight affects a German accent throughout and he becomes a bit annoying after awhile, but I was surprisingly caught up in the middle of the film.  Although it descends into a preachy revenge drama, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 October 2006<br />A Matter of Life and Death<br />Michael Powell / Emeric Pressburger, UK, 1946<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS recording o<br />Company: none<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5 October 2006<br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<br />Terry Gilliam, USA, 1998<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: Daniel<br />Daniel snagged this for ?1 at a charity shop and he had never seen it, so I plopped on the couch to enjoy this for the nth time.  I think the last time I watched this was in the theater in Lexington, where the big-screen movement made me somewhat nauseous.   In the small-screen form it was significantly more digestable.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 October 2006<br />Weird Paul: A Lo Fidelity Documentary<br />Stacey Goldschmidt, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD on projecto<br />Company: Brian, Daniel<br />Hey, I'm in this film!<br /><br /><br /><br />30 October 2006<br />The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!<br />David Zucker, USA, 1988<br />Location: living room<br />Format: VHS<br />Company: Brian<br />Watched with Brian while putting CDs together before tour.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 November 2006<br />Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan<br />Larry Charles, USA, 2006<br />Location: Film Staden, Malm?<br />Format: 35mm film<br />Company: Ben, Anna Granqvist<br />I had fairly low expectations for the Borat film so I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The gross-out bits weren't particular to the S. Baron-Cohen style, but successful anyway. The best bits from the show are far better than anything in the film, but I still dug it, fer sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 December 2006<br />The Jerk<br />Carl Reiner, USA, 1979<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />Tis the season to re-watch old favorites, especially when you have someone new to watch it with.  Die, you random son of a bitch!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />18 December 2006<br />Videodrome<br />David Cronenberg, Canada, 1983<br />Location: Giles'<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Tara, Giles<br />This resembled a Thomas Pychon novel very closely, at least for the first half until the more standard horror elements took place.  The Cathode Ray Mission is like the Thanatoids straight out of Vineland, and the idea of intercepting a snuff video transmission reminded me of The Crying of Lot 49.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 December 2006<br />Koroshiya 1<br />Takashi Miike, Japan / Hong Kong / South Korea, 2001<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />Rewatching this, it held up quite well, coming off as a lot less cartoonish than I remembered and actually pretty extreme. I actually winced in pain a few times, and stayed attentive to the weird plot twists.  Some of the special effects were so real they were gut-wrenching, while others were completely cartoonish.  <br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2006<br />Rushmore<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 1998<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast w/<br />Company: Tara<br />When something is as feel-good as this, putting it on for Christmas was a pretty smart move.  Tara had (somehow) never seen it before, and it's not like I ever tire of Wes Anderson films. I noticed a few nice details - Max is drinking tomato soup in the math fantasy at the beginning, and there's a scene of him and his father watching TV and it's an old b&w football game from the 50's or 60's.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2006<br />Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1972<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />Not sure why I felt like watching this - perhaps it had to do with a conversation about early wacky Woody Allen films. This was the first of his films that I ever saw, which I found in my Dad's videos and I thought it was porno so I watched it.  I never realised that it was Lou Jacobi from Little Murders in the transvestite episode!<br /><br /><br /><br />26 December 2006<br />Be Here to Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt<br />Margaret Brown, USA, 2004<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Excellent biopic about TVZ, with a ton of great footage from home movies, TV appearances, and live shows.  The talking heads were central, but unlike the Minutemen documentary it actually consisted entirely of anecdotes rather than praise.  I found this more of a tearjerker as well, though I think D.Boon's death was a greater tragedy; maybe it's easy to blame TVZ for his own rough lifestyle, or maybe it's that he was past his prime anyway - but the film presents his death with just the right amount of emotional weight.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 December 2006<br />Papillon<br />Franklin J. Schaffner, USA / France, 1973<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Excellent escape drama starring the Brett Favre-esque Steve McQueen and a young Dustin Hoffman.  Though exquisitely photographed, the film ran a bit long and was fairly anticlimactic by the end.  I think I prefer when a foreign character doesn't even try to appear foreign, as opposed to copping an accent the whole film (like Jon Voight in The Odessa File).<br /><br /><br /><br />30 December 2006<br />They Might Be Giants<br />Anthony Harvey, USA, 1971<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Very cute screwball comedy that would have been very inspiring had I seen it in my early teens.  George C Scott is a pleasure to watch even with such a hammy script, and as cute stuff goes this is the way I like it.  It gets really ridiculous by the end but is charming throughout. Also features early appearances by M. Emmet Walsh and F. Murray Abraham.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 December 2006<br />Possible Worlds<br />Robert Lepage, Canada, 2000<br />Location: Garrioch living room<br />Format: DivX Avi on TV <br />Company: none<br />Pretty stupid.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2007<br />Kicking and Screaming<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 1995<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />In a low energy New Years Day mood, I decided to re-watch Kicking and Screaming (which I hadn't seen since college, where an enthusiastic guy at the radio station named Dave Synder recommended it).  A decade later it already feels extremely dated, but entertaining; the stuck-in-a-rut post-collegiate thing obviously would have clicked with me much more a few years ago, but it's saved by not trying to be too ambitious.  Some of the humour feels very forced, but it never wears out its welcome.  As a snapshot into the mid-90's, it maybe serves a historical purpose in a weird way.  Plus, Elliott Gould.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2007<br />Beyond Therapy<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1987<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Though I had planned to start 2007 by investigating Godard, Altman's death last month has made me nostalgic to review his career, especially some of the minor films I had never seen.  This is often considered to be Altman's worst film, but I actually enjoyed it.  It's deeply flawed, and perhaps the biggest flaw is that it's actually very funny - the type of stage comedy that doesn't work with his anarchic style.  Julie Hagerty is completely annoying outside of Airplane, but the film is saved by Christopher Guest's gay character.  The Altman style of overlapping dialogue works well for a script where every character is completely insane, and while I wouldn't recommend this film or even watch it again, it certainly wasn't a waste of 91 minutes.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2007<br />Annie Hall<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1977<br />Location: living room<br />Format: TV broadcast<br />Company: none<br />Full-frame version.  I haven't seen this in awhile and it's a shame; this is the most perfect summation of Allen's career, and now that I'm a bit older it resonates a bit more, showing different pathways one can take.  Most importantly, it's very funny.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2007<br />I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!<br />Hy Averback, USA, 1968<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This film is like a much less interesting version of Preminger's Skidoo, using Peter Sellers to poke fun at 60's hippie culture. I didn't find this particularly funny apart from the scene where the parents eat the pot brownies, and Sellers wasn't especially memorable.  Still, I was entertained enough to keep watching, and as I have a general interest in films from this period it was worth seeing (though I'd rank it below both Skidoo and the first two DePalma films).<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2007<br />Mikey and Nicky<br />Elaine May, USA, 1976<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Where did this film come from?  Though Elaine May (creator of Ishtar!) wrote and directed it, it feels so much like a Cassavetes film due mostly to Cassavetes and Peter Falk starring in it, but also the loose, rough feel of the editing and the weird camera angles.  Was she trying to tribute his style or was this his influence from the set?  Either way, it's incredible to see these two work together again - this could be Husbands 2.  There's not a moment that this stops being entertaining.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 January 2007<br />A Prairie Home Companion<br />Robert Altman, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Altman's last film is a wonderfully sentimental adaptation of Garrison Keillors long-running radio show.  I've always had a big soft spot for Keillor, no doubt encouraged by my mother's frequent listening to this show when I was growing up (and the excellence of Lake Wobegon Days).  With a large cast, Altman works his usual magic - the chaos of a radio stage show is perfectly suited to his style, and the music and cast and fantastic.  It's a fitting final film - one that will be remembered fondly, I think - and Garrison Keillor is a national treasure.  Even with a hokey, slightly unfinished plot (and no stories from Lake Wobegon), A Prairie Home Companion suceeds as few adaptation do.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 January 2007<br />Little Miss Sunshine<br />Jonathan Dayton / Valerie Faris, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel, Tara<br />Popular road movie that is somehow nominated for an Oscar; any film with Alan Arkin is a guaranteed winner with me, though his lines were easy and he exits the film a bit early.  The ending was a bit stupid but I found the film genuinely funny.  This is totally the kind of film my mother absolutely loves; she has a thing for films about families, and one good thing I can say is that they happy ending is merely a panacea and none of the character's fuckups actually have any solution waiting.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2007<br />Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />The team that made Anchorman delivered this Nascar-themed Will Ferrell vehicle last year, and I slept on it as it had limited UK interest. Luckily, they managed to make a film about Nascar with little actual Nascar in it. It took awhile for me to get into this, but a few parts had me laughing uncontrollably and I will probably watch it again.  It's not half the film that Anchorman is, but a pleasant enough way to pass the time.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2007<br />The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife<br />Nick Broomfield, UK, 1991<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />Great documentary exploring the Boer leader Eugene Terre'Blanche and Broomfield's attempts to get an interview.  Structurally, it follows Roger and Me, though without the need to explain as much backstory; the AWB and their followers manage to indict themselves easily enough through their idiotic statements.  The Louis Theroux episode with Terre'Blanche shows him as a significantly more frightening man; here he just seems Idi Amin-esque - foolish, ego-centric, and unwilling to listen to others.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 January 2007<br />Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel, Tara<br />I really didn't need to watch this a second time.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 February 2007<br />Capote<br />Bennett Miller, Canada / USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel<br />Dramtization of the relationship between Truman Capote and one of the killers from In Cold Blood that succeeds via striking Americana cinematography and strong performances from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee.  Chris Cooper helps; the film is actually quickly paced too, so the years pass by quickly and the relationship intensifies.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 February 2007<br />Snakes on a Plane<br />David R. Ellis / Lex Halaby, Germany / USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Tara, Daniel<br />Everything amazing about this film you can read in its Wikipedia entry.  Otherwise the whole thing is a shit-filled buildup to a shitty catchphrase that doesn't even know how bad to make its intentional badness. <br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2007<br />Zazie dans le m&#233;tro<br />Louis Malle, France / Italy, 1960<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX via projec<br />Company: Ryan, his girlfriend, Andy<br />Malle's adaptation of Queneau holds true to the pace and irreverence, attempting to carry the verbal experimentation with some surreal, Vaudevillian visual slapstick.  But although the scene on top of the Eiffel Tower was stunning, I was bored; much of the movie consisted of repeated Benny Hill stop-action motion with little more to balance it.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2007<br />Beerfest<br />Jay Chandrasekhar, USA / Australia, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Tara<br />Broken Lizard actually aren't anything special- they hit the succesful formula with Super Troopers and have done nothing else remarkable.  This was funnier than Club Dread but only slightly; really, these guys aren't any funnier than a Police Academy movie.  But maybe they've realised this as they're making Super Troopers 2.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2007<br />Art School Confidential<br />Terry Zwigoff, USA, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: Daniel<br />Limp adaptation of a great Dan Clowes comic; this made me laugh a few times through its easy stereotypes but overall just reeked of lameness. Maybe Zwigoff should actually look outside of comics for his inspiration - and I say this as a huge, huge Eightball fan.  Hopefully my favorite Eightball piece, "Blue Italian Shit", will never be made into a film.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 February 2007<br />The Osterman Weekend<br />Sam Peckinpah, USA, 1983<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX via projec<br />Company: Tara<br />I don't know much about Peckinpah but gave this a spin based on the plot summary and figuring it would be fun to see Craig T. Nelson in a film.  This is a wildly out of control paranoid trainwreck that picks up from great 70's films about surveillance like The Anderson Tapes or The Conversation and grafts it onto overblown 80s excess.  As terrible as it is, there's something enjoyable about watching it, and maybe I should actually see some good Peckinpah.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 March 2007<br />Inland Empire<br />David Lynch, France / Poland / USA, 2006<br />Location: GFT<br />Format: 35mm filmprojec<br />Company: Tara<br />Lynch's new megafilm is easier to write about now that I've had a few days to dwell on it.  While I still feel like Lynch's aesthetic is completely opposite of my own, I was so completely overwhelmed by this that I can't express anything but enthusiasm.  As ugly as single-CCD DV is, the blurryness expressed what he wanted to express and the subconscious, visceral images worked even better than film would have.  It's good to see someone truly exploring the potential of cinema, and as much as I enjoyed Mulholland Drive this remake is a lot more groundbreaking.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 March 2007<br />The Dish<br />Rob Sitch, Australia, 2000<br />Location: living room <br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara, Daniel<br />Extremely lighthearted (and I mean extremely) and enjoyable only if you're interested in Australia as I recently have become.  This makes me want to watch Possession again, as Sam Neill is a lot more memorable in that.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 March 2007<br />Possession<br />Andrzej Zulawski, France / West Germany, 1981<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX via projec<br />Company: Tara for half<br />I'm disappointed that Tara didn't stick with this; she was troubled by the overacting, but that is part of what makes this film so powerful - the extremity of performance mirroring the extremity of the subject matter.  After seeing INLAND EMPIRE I'm thinking there are similar approaches here, though I prefer Zulawski's dark, European subconscious to Lynch's B-movie, Americana-infused psyche.  I always think of this film as truly horrifying, on multiple levels.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 March 2007<br />The 40 Year Old Virgin<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />Watched yet again (Tara had never seen it).<br /><br /><br /><br />15 April 2007<br />The Ninth Configuration<br />William Peter Blatty, USA, 1980<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />There's something really awesome about the first two-thirds of this film - the confusing mishmash of styles and humour that doesn't really work, yet does - and though the ending goes for an over-the-top emotional punch, I enjoyed it anyway.  The theological side seems a bit thin - the questions it asks about faith are pretty basic - but I suppose for a film it's pretty good.  I'd watch this again for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 April 2007<br />Brick<br />Rian Johnson, USA, 2005<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I enjoyed this film from the get-go, but I was completely enthralled by it when it finished.  By describing it, it's going to sound like a gimmick along the lines of Memento: a classic 40's film noir plot, transposed to a modern day high school.  The novelty of this never wears thin, however, and the plot avoids anything silly so it functions as a really sucessful mystery despite the high school setting.  The ending credits came up with 'Sister Ray' and I wonder if perhaps the plot is modeled after it?<br /><br /><br /><br />5 May 2007<br />Al Franken: God Spoke<br />Nick Doob / Chris Hegedus, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />It's a low point when Saturday night involves sitting in my room alone and watching the Al Franken documentary.  I don't actually like Al Franken that much, because I don't think he's very funny.  He certainly thinks he's funny though, as he laughs throughout the entire film, clearly pleased at his own ideas.  A few parts were fun though, as I agree with his politics and ultimately I feel that he is a "good" thing.  <br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2007<br />Science des r&#234;ves, La<br />Michel Gondry, France / Italy, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />It's playful about romance in that way that I hate (at times making me think of a male version of Amelie, or that Miranda July film), yet I really liked this anyway.  The dreamworld is mapped out with genuine sincerity, yet there are hints of something truly dark underneath and flashes of true violence (without any actual violence, if that makes any sense).  I would have enjoyed this far more without the romantic angle, but at least it held back from being completely sappy.  Which is more than I can say about myself as I watched it.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 May 2007<br />Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan<br />Larry Charles, USA, 2006<br />Location: plane<br />Format: video on airpla<br />Company: none<br />Watched on the plane, instead of actually watching something I hadn't seen before.  Still funny the second time.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2007<br />Breach<br />Billy Ray, USA, 2007<br />Location: Quantas flight QF1 (Bangkok to London)<br />Format: airplane LCD sc<br />Company: none<br />This was a fictionalised account of the unmasking of an FBI traitor, which I watched to pass the time on a 13 hour flight.  Chris Cooper is a favorite actor of mine, though he was phoning it in here, and Ryan Phillipe has yet to impress me in anything. <br /><br /><br /><br />6 June 2007<br />Science des r&#234;ves, La<br />Michel Gondry, France / Italy, 2006<br />Location: living room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara, Daniel<br />I was worried that the second time I wouldn't like this film, but actually I loved it.  Really loved it.  As in, was seriously moved by it.  It's too bad that I watched it with the love of my life and she fell asleep.  Tara, I mean, not Daniel.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 June 2007<br />Sicko<br />Michael Moore, USA, 2007<br />Location: parents' living room<br />Format: DivX converted <br />Company: Anthony, Mom, Tara, Dad<br />Easily the worst Michael Moore film yet (at least The Big One was funny), Sicko spends far too long telling me nothing that I didn't already know, and then throws a stunt in at the end.  I guess if I liked Michael Moore more, I might enjoy this, but I was irritated and mostly just bored.  I would say that "it's a good thing if people see this and it leads to health care reform" but I had hopes that his last film would affect some sort of change, and Bush still won.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 July 2007<br />Knocked Up<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2007<br />Location: AMC, Newport KY<br />Format: 35mm film in th<br />Company: Tara, Spencer, Chris Bergan<br />I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this, but I found The 40 Year Old Virgin to be one of the best mainstream Hollywood comedies since Caddyshack so I was curious how Seth Rogan could handle a starring role.  And while this wasn't half as good, I laughed a lot, which is I guess all that matters.  The sappyness was even more annoying here, but there was enough raunchy humour to keep me interested (though I wouldn't watch it again).<br /><br /><br /><br />15 July 2007<br />North by Northwest<br />Alfred Hitchcock, USA, 1959<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Way more fun that I remembered.  And that last scene, of the train going into a tunnel - wow! <br /><br /><br /><br />16 July 2007<br />The Killing of America<br />Sheldon Renan / Leonard Schrader, USA / Japan, 1982<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />What a trashumentary!  While it gets dull (and it follows no sort of linear progression), some of the footage is absolutely frightening - the guy leading his mortgage lender through the streets with a shotgun, or the stuff from Jonestown.  The interviews with Ed Kemper and Sirhan Sirhan are also brilliant - where did this stuff come from?  <br /><br /><br /><br />18 July 2007<br />Crossing the Line<br />Daniel Gordon, UK, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Despite the weird narration by Christian Slater, this film was fascinating as a glimpse inside North Korea.  The country doesn't look as fucked up and devastated as I expected, though that's probably because the North Korean government was very careful about what could be filmed.  This is an extremely interesting story, and the film is paced well and slightly stylized without going overboard.  The clips from the Kim Jong Il-directed feature films are the most amazing thing - I would love to see an entire North Korean film!<br /><br /><br /><br />21 July 2007<br />Fever Pitch<br />Richard Brooks, USA, 1985<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DiVX<br />Company: none<br />This is the last film Richard Brooks ever made, and it's regarded as a complete disaster - which it quite fair.  I have a thing for weird Hollywood trainwrecks, and I'm developing a thing for strange 80's films gone wrong, so this was perfect.  I can't explain why I actually enjoyed this, except that I never got bored as the film was pretty much off the rails from the beginning (without actually being that crazy).  It's rare to see a film so overwhelmingly bad, yet so indescribably fascinating.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 July 2007<br />The Valachi Papers<br />Terence Young, France / Italy, 1972<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Based on a true story, this is a mob movie starring Charles Bronson as an older, likeable mob henchman who spills the beans to the feds.  The film is a bit long and I got bored with all of the forgettable Italian characters and mafia stereotypes, and I kept waiting for Charles Bronson to start kicking ass, but he really doesn't.  Yet I liked it, perhaps for this reason - it maintained a tension throughout that never really gets released.  Nice castration scene, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 July 2007<br />The Big Bad Swim<br />Ishai Setton, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Innocuous, sure, and bland and boring and feelgood.  This would be a good one to watch if I ever need to remember why most independent cinema in America is very dull.  I could have turned it off but it didn't even provoke me to do that.  Sometimes I sit through the end of bad films just so I can list them here - maybe I should think about not requiring myself to watch a film to completion for PBT inclusion.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2007<br />The Simpsons Movie<br />David Silverman, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: VCD theater boo<br />Company: Tara<br />I figured this would be enjoyable but it actually far exceeded my expectations.  Absolutely hilarious, and it didn't just rely on swearing or doing things they couldn't do on TV.  The longer storyline didn't drag and the art was actually really embellished a bit for the big screen.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 August 2007<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br />Matt Birch, UK, 2007<br />Location: <br />Format: IMAX w/3-D scen<br />Company: Tara, Tom, Jess<br />The 3D effect was OK - I slowly sipped homebrews the whole time, hoping to be pretty drunk for it, but it didn't really seem to make much of a difference.  And I guess it was a pretty irresponsible thing to do since I was there with my niece and nephew.  The film was well-made I suppose, though compressing the vast length of the Harry Potter books into a film renders all non-Harry characters to just be cameos.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 August 2007<br />The Boxer's Last Stand<br />Shan-si Ting, Taiwan, 1976<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I enjoyed the third X-Men movie, maybe not as much as the second - it succeded in doing what needed to be done in the third and final film of a superhero franchise, and the special effects were good.  I think the acting was a bit weakened here (maybe due to Brian Singer's absence) but it still managed to stir the comic book geek that has lain dormant in my for the past 15 years.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 August 2007<br />Who Killed the Electric Car?<br />Chris Paine, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This was a very well-done documentary that kept my interest the entire time.  It's point of view was clear yet it attempted to give opposing argument and never stretched things.  It's a bit depressing too.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 August 2007<br />Mean Girls<br />Mark Waters, USA, 2004<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />I know Trevor gave this big props but I didn't expect to enjoy it so much myself.  Sure, it's just a teen-themed comedy movie, but it managed to be very mainstream yet funny and entertaining at the same time.  Maybe there will again be a day where I can watch art films.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 August 2007<br />$<br />Richard Brooks, USA, 1971<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I'm slowly investigating the work of Richard Brooks, perhaps in a backwards manner; after the very weird Wrong is Right and the totally gonzo Fever Pitch, this seems much more sedate.  It's a crime caper set in Frankfort with a very young Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn, and a clueless Gert Frobe as the fall guy.  The lengthy scene where the actual theft takes place is incredibly suspenseful and largely silent, again reminding me of Rififi (is that the most influential film ever, or do I just think it is?).  The pacing was a little weird and the chase scene at the end was really ridiculous, but I'm always more forgiving of things from the 70's.  Brooks' viewpoint here isn't as perverse as in Fever Pitch (the only people who are robbed are bad people), but there's still some sort of moral ambiguity here that I can't quit put my finger on.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 August 2007<br />Superbad<br />Greg Mottola, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX from camer<br />Company: Tara<br />Watching this shitty camera bootleg actually affected my enjoyment of the film, but I still laughed a lot.  The McLovin plot drove the whole thing, and the juvenile humour of these Apatow productions works more effectively with a juvenile cast.  Plus, Kitty Cat Man was good.  I wouldn't even mind sitting through this again properly, though it's hard for me to justify why this isn't just another American Pie.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 September 2007<br />Wedding Crashers<br />David Dobkin, USA, 2005<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This was crap - I laughed a few times early on, but the film turned out to be much crappier than I imagined. I need to stop believing that any bad Hollywood comedy will be at least enjoyable - this was actually total pain to get through.  <br /><br /><br /><br />24 September 2007<br />The Damned<br />Joseph Losey, UK, 1963<br />Location: bedroom and my room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Holy shit.  This is seriously fucking amazing.  All I ever knew about Joseph Losey is that he was chased out of America by HUAC and made his films in Britain.  Watching The Damned with that in mind lends a slight air of paranoia to the film, though it's really far more intense than the typical paranoia trip.  It's incredible that something this intense could have been made in the early 60's; it's as bleak as anything I've ever seen, and given the state of the world at that time it's even more incredible (because it no longer has the soft distance that we have from the nuclear threat).  This is definitely rewatchable.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 October 2007<br />A Scanner Darkly<br />Richard Linklater, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara, Dave<br />Hmmm? I just read a great PK Dick novel which made me think to download this, which I meant to see when it came out.  It's been about a decade since I read the book so I don't remember a whole lot of it.  I enjoyed this film, mostly because the animation style really accented the dislocation of reality presented by Dick's prose.  The terrible acting of Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr seemed a bit worse when having to watch an animated version of them, and the whole story felt a bit too narratively together - was the book that clear?<br /><br /><br /><br />8 October 2007<br />The Wizard<br />Todd Holland, USA, 1989<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Dave<br />Though it's a big commercial for Nintendo, I had fond memories of "The Wizard" and a repeat viewing 18 years later holds up amazingly well.  I mean, it is a cheesy kid quest movie, but watching it with a peer (who was also Nintendo-obsessed at the time) was tons of fun - and the film didn't have as many video-game scenes as I remembered.  Films like this walk the line between A-list and B-movie - obviously landing Christian Slater and Fred Savage wasn't easy, and the budget was clearly decent, yet the film was still incredibly sloppy and poorly made.  If only Dave Crapo were here to watch it with me instead of Dave from Australia.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 October 2007<br />Notte, La<br />Michelangelo Antonioni, Italy / France, 1961<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This film oozes "modernism", beginning with some incredible, sparse electroacoustic music during the opening credits that's the perfect counterpoint to the scenes of barren urbanity.  The feelings of isolation are so strong, personified by the crazed nymphomaniac in the hospital and the distance between Giovanni and the two female leads.  It all ends on a feeling of hopelessness, yet a beautiful one, while traveling through issues of commitment, art, and capitalism.  <br /><br /><br /><br />12 October 2007<br />Eclisse, L'<br />Michelangelo Antonioni, Italy / France, 1962<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Whatever Antonioni started with L'Avventura and L'Eclisse is refined here into a clinical, bleak statement about alienation.  The closing sequence is absolutely stunning - radicallly experimental, yet beautiful and direct at the same time.  The bulk of the film is almost plotless - it flows so loosely, yet it never feels sloppy or anarchic.  I'm really into Antonioni now - and glad i'm judging him by this and not Blow-Up.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 October 2007<br />Dirty Rotten Scoundrels<br />Frank Oz, USA, 1988<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara for parts<br />I remembered this well, then started watching it and though "oh shit, this is going to be crap" but it actually turned out OK, thanks to Steve Martin and Michael Caine who are always excellent.  <br /><br /><br /><br />19 October 2007<br />Dawn of the Dead<br />George A. Romero, Italy / USA, 1978<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara for a small bit<br />I haven't seen this in about five years, but it's pretty much perfect.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 October 2007<br />Masculin f&#233;minin: 15 faits pr&#233;cis<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Sweden, 1966<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Maybe this is the perfect Godard film.  It's poised between embracing revolutionary politics and exploring the emotional unravelings of youth - and it's precisely because of this in-between that it's perfect.  Chantal Goya is beautiful, and the music throughout is totally fucking great.  As a document of mid-sixties Paris, it's a perfect time capsule (I guess, not having been there); the attitudes expressed are fairly ad-libbed and the overwhelming spectre of class politics looms behind everything.  But there's enough of a sense of the uncertainty and conflicts that undermined the 1968 riots.  Amazing!<br /><br /><br /><br />31 October 2007<br />Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens<br />F.W. Murnau, Germany, 1922<br />Location: All Saints Church, Newcastle-upon-Tyne<br />Format: DVD projected w<br />Company: Jazzfinger (except when they played)<br />The film is actually a bit dull - though with some wonderful scenes - but Jazzfinger's soundtrack was absolutely spot-on.  The dark drones of their sound are perfect for the Carpathian atmosphere of this film.  Throughout the entirety of this (extended) print, they managed to keep kicking it up a notch, <br /><br /><br /><br />2 November 2007<br />Deserto rosso, Il<br />Michelangelo Antonioni, Italy / France, 1964<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />In some ways this is a continuation of the preceding three Antonioni films, only introducing color as a new tool for symbolism.  And while the use of color is very creative, the soundtrack is what really tickled me here.  The sounds of this decayed Ravenna landscape are twisted and mutated, serving to emphasize the alienation of the natural world.  And throughout Vitti and Harris' tryst, there's a really quiet electronic bleating that brutalises the liason.  Since I enjoyed this and the three before it so much, maybe I should re-evaluate Blow Up to see if I find it as empty a second time through.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 November 2007<br />Sans soleil<br />Chris Marker, France, 1983<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Like La Jet?e, Sans Soleil is about memory.  But instead of a crazy science-fiction narrative, this takes the form of travelogue, looking at ways that the Japanese and Guinean people approach time, space and death.  A few passages, primarily wordless ones, use the soundtrack to create a sense of extrerrestrial intelligence, observing our Earth as if it is something unknown to us.  The images feel like a dream, tied together by Marker's observations which are loose and journal-like, rather than a concentrated statement.  Though it lacks the fantasticness of La Jet?e, it contains all of the imagination and demands another viewing, which I will try to do soon.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 November 2007<br />Cr&#237;a cuervos<br />Carlos Saura, Spain, 1976<br />Location: bedroom and my studio<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This is a beautiful, spooky film made more powerful by amazing child actors and a script the deals with issues of memory and loss.  I've read that it's a huge critique of the Franco regime, but it doesn't need to be to communicate.  The film is very much about being between things - the daughter is the middle child, the family is middle class - and she is between two worlds, unable to let come to terms with her mother's death.  The flash-future monologues by Gearldine Chaplain are soaked in remorse, suggesting that Ana's troubles do not come to an easy conclusion.  Here is a film that is very slow, and its slowness is its achievement.  Wonderful.  <br /><br /><br /><br />9 November 2007<br />Eating Raoul<br />Paul Bartel, USA, 1982<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Eating Raoul is a bit of a cult classic and for good reason.  It's campy exaggerations remind me of John Waters, but in the best possible way.  It's tongue-in-cheek moralizing never loses its charm and Paul Bartel is totally magnificent in the lead role.  This type of "offbeat" humour isn't that tremendously offbeat these days, yet this still holds up well.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 November 2007<br />Executive Action<br />David Miller, USA, 1973<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I've wanted to see this for a long time, being that I love 70's conspiracy films and have a slight interest in the JFK assassination.  I was pretty disappointed, as this filmed presented an amalgamation of theories without anything particularly concrete to go on.  The conspirators are never identified; we are never sure if they are rogue government agents, business elites, or just ideologues.  The best moment is the presentation of Lee Oswald's background, which sheds some light onto what an incredible mystery that man was.  I wouldn't recommend this or watch it again unless it was part of some greater program of films.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 November 2007<br />Squirm<br />Jeff Lieberman, USA, 1976<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Sinead<br />I dug Squirm; it was definitely slow but when the worms were attacking the editing was just perfect, keeping them on-screen just long enough to be effective.  The fact that worms can be scary at all is a testimony to the director's skill; it makes up for the hole-filled plot, annoying hillbilly accents, and basically all of the moments when there aren't worms on-screen.  The scene with the worms crawling into Roger's face is an unforgettable visual moment.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 November 2007<br />The Darjeeling Limited<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 2007<br />Location: UCG<br />Format: 35mm film in th<br />Company: Tara<br />Much anticipation for what I (correctly) predicted would be the Wes Anderson film to hit me most personally; I wasn't even remotely disappointed.  The landscape and confusion of India is perfect for Anderson's visual and narrative approach; he did so little to embellish it (which was my biggest fear) and actually I think was incredibly respectful, delicately treating the culture difference in a way that was spot-fucking-on.  Too much to think about; of course I will go see it again.  Definitely less heavy-handed, maybe his best since Rushmore (though I loved Life Aquatic so much the first time, then didn't care for it nearly as much the second-time through). In fact, less ambitious overall - which maybe he realised was necessary after the last two which were just ludicrus.  I love this man's work so much.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 December 2007<br />A Christmas Story<br />Bob Clark, USA / Canada, 1983<br />Location: <br />Format: <br />Company: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />18 December 2007<br />White Christmas<br />Michael Curtiz, USA, 1954<br />Location: <br />Format: <br />Company: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />27 December 2007<br />The Comedians of Comedy<br />Michael Blieden, USA, 2005<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Documentary about a comedy tour of Patton Oswalt, Zach Galifanakis, Maria Bamford and Brian Posehn that is pretty consistently entertaining.  Maybe they watched that horrible David Cross tour video before they made it and realised how not to make a comedy tour video.  Everyone stays positive and has fun, and there's actually a great deal of standup comedy in it, which is pretty solidly funny.  I recognized a lot of the jokes from other stuff they've done but I still enjoyed this a lot.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 January 2008<br />No Country for Old Men<br />Ethan Coen / Joel Coen, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX rip of DVD<br />Company: none<br />Awesome!  The Coens finest film in almost a decade, this was a total celebration of everything they love about cinema.  Though I've never read Cormac McCarthy, this was beautiful and scary in exactly the way I <i>imagine</i> his books to be. Deakins does it again with some incredible colors - enough to tempt me to go see it in the theatre later this month.  A great "first film of the year" - may there be many more.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 January 2008<br />Putney Swope<br />Robert Downey Sr., USA, 1969<br />Location: Bedroom<br />Format: DVD via video projector<br />Company: Al, Mark, Tara<br />Will I ever tire of this film?&nbsp; Year after year I continue to be amazed by it's insanity.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 January 2008<br />The Ten<br />David Wain, USA, 2007<br />Location: Bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br /><p>I didn't think this was going to be good, but it was really really terrible.&nbsp; There were a few moments I chuckled at - specifically the black twins sketch - but the rest of it was really horrible.&nbsp; I know Wain and the Stella guys are really into obvious, exaggerated bad humour but in Stella it works really well; here, I just felt like I was watching a student improv night.&nbsp; The Paul Rudd 'story' throughout was so uninteresting and the musical number at the end actually made me embarassed to watch. Sometimes I think that comedy people should hold themselves to a higher artistic standard, because comedy is art. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />31 January 2008<br />Journeys from Berlin/1971<br />Yvonne Rainer, USA / UK / West Germany, 1980<br />Location: Bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was completely incredible and overwhelming, through it's density of language and radical approach to the nonfiction essay film.&nbsp; I studied this carefully but I can't say I grasped much of what Rainer was trying to touch upon.&nbsp; But as a thought-provoking work about violence and radical politics, it greatly succeeded - and with a unique aesthetic approach that, while low on thrills, stands apart from most other films (even most other experimental films).</p><p>I know little about Rainer except that she was a choreographer, yet this film seems as isolated from dance and choreography as possible.&nbsp; There is a great deal of rhythm in the editing and the soundtrack, yet it is languidly paced and relies upon language and sound rather than image to weave its magic.&nbsp; I could see myself watching this much more closely but there's no enigma to crack; it's a masterpiece not of atmosphere or surrealism but of cold, real ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to when it was made and that it was made by a woman, I can't help but think of this in a feminist context.&nbsp; Of course a major theme of the film is the reconciliation of violence with an emotional, humanistic side.&nbsp; I'm hesistant to draw and conclusions of the feminist type because I am no expert on the subject and I would be afraid of misconstruing Rainer's intent; however, I went into this with my own presumptions and I think they were served quite beautifully.I can't help but compare it to Valie Export for the similar geography and sense of free association, plus the way it makes the universal so incredibly personal.&nbsp; This aspect, to me, is what I think differentiates it from a 'male' essay, though I think this gets close to dangerous territory. </p><p>My further (somewhat unstructured) notes are at http://www.icewhistle.com/MLitt/?p=32.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 February 2008<br />Primary<br />Robert Drew, USA, 1960<br />Location: Bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara, Sinead<br />I'm not sure whether or not to include this - it may be a short (which I don't list), but it may be just over 60 minutes and therefore a 'feature'. I didn't completely focus on this as we talked over it a lot, but it seemed like a seminal work of cinema verite.&nbsp; Seeing Kennedy and Humphrey giving speeches in little town halls, with only a few microphones and the odd camera really makes it seem like another universe.&nbsp; Watching this before all the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; bullshit was kinda nice, if not sad.&nbsp; But part of me loves the bullshit.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 February 2008<br />The King of Kong<br />Seth Gordon, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />A great, fun documentary that surpasses &quot;High Score&quot; for drama.&nbsp; The filmmakers bias only emerges in the middle of the film, but it doesn't stand in the way of this being a delightful portrait of a very fringe group of people.&nbsp; Gordon doesn't try to exploit these people for their eccentricities, but rather keeps things positive and allows the genuine humanity to do the talking.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 February 2008<br />Juno<br />Jason Reitman, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />Another one of those high school movies, still chasing the pinnacle that is <em>Rushmore</em>.&nbsp; As a passionate fan of Wes Anderson I'm always underwhelmed by these lesser versions, though this one was genuinely funny and only mildly irritating.&nbsp; Was Apatow behind this somehow?&nbsp; What's with this plethora of anti-abortion, family values-promoting comedies?&nbsp; A secret pro-life agenda hiding behind an 'alternative' comedy (if you were the type that found <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> 'alternative') scares me but I did laugh, in a way that I was almost ashamed of (at times).&nbsp; There was enough cute fey indie bullshit to annoy me (like the super twee soundtrack) and I really shoulda have spent the time watching something more 'worthwhile'.&nbsp; Still, it was better than <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> by a mile, though that doesn't take much. <br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2008<br />The Last Detail<br />Hal Ashby, USA, 1973<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This 'classic' has always escaped me but I finally gave it the time of day and I was totally delighted.&nbsp; The script was really the core of it; it's easy to see what made Robert Towne such a celebrity screenwriter in the 70's.&nbsp; That's not to denigrate the performances - Nicholson plays perhaps the definitive Jack Nicholson role here, and Otis Young is equally brilliant.&nbsp; It's strangely lighthearted, yet I was never sure exactly how much to let my guard down.&nbsp; It definitely feels like a Hal Ashby film, at least alongside <em>Harold and Maude</em> or <em>Being There</em> - the menace of heavyness hides behind every laugh.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 February 2008<br />Valerie a t&#253;den divu<br />Jaromil Jires, Czechoslovakia, 1970<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />I always expected this to be much more visually dazzling.&nbsp; It was certainly inventive and bold, and maybe it's only because I am comparing to Chytlova's films that I was a bit disappointed.&nbsp; <em>Valerie </em>was a great deal pervier than I imagined, with such dark sexuality leaking through everything that I felt a bit dirty watching it.&nbsp; As a fantastic vision of Freudian malevolence, there is almost nothing like it.&nbsp; Though it's definitely a great experience, I found the film lacking something and I never made a really strong connection to it myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 February 2008<br />Safe Men<br />John Hamburg, USA, 1998<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: Tara<br />LEAP DAY!&nbsp; And what a better way to celebrate than with this all-time fave, which I actually haven't seen since moving to Britain (and never seen in widescreen before).&nbsp; I may question why I married someone who doesn't see the incredible brilliance of this film on first viewing, but hopefully she'll come around.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2008<br />Southland Tales<br />Richard Kelly, Germany / USA / France, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />What a beautiful dream of a film.&nbsp; Continuing from the Philip K Dick realityfuck of <em>Donnie Darko</em>, Kelly uses his big budget to pull in a ridiculous cast (featuring Justin Timberlake, John Larroquette, Nora Dunn and Wallace Shawn among others) and throw up an even more grandiose vision.&nbsp; I expected a 'mess' cause that's what all the press warned me about, but instead I found an extremely meticulously plotted religious allegory underneath the most post-modern of cultural portraits.&nbsp; The annoying teenage stuff from <em>Darko</em> is shed here, with some heavy David Lynch influences picked up - and the result is a film that is probably more in touch with the contemporary world than many others I have seen.&nbsp; <em>Southland</em>'s views of technology, celebrity, technology and politics are exaggerated, but not much; and furthermore, it holds back from any explicit critique of these elements, and gives (much needed) time for the plot to evolve.&nbsp; There's some serious 'misses' in terms of humour, but the wooden acting works given the script and the special effects drive the film without becoming a crutch.&nbsp; The vision is ultimately more successful than <em>Cremaster</em>, I think - because it's placed in a more accessible environment, the surrealist aspect hits even harder.&nbsp; I fear that my enjoyment of this partially comes from the &quot;whacked out&quot; factor, as in &quot;how the hell did this get made?&quot; - which is not in itself a justification.&nbsp; It may fade in future viewings, but at least I had the thrill of this first time.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 March 2008<br />Monster Camp<br />Cullen Hoback, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom/my room<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />This documentary on LARPS plays it very very safe and it's pretty poorly made, but the subject is entertaining enough that I made it through all 80 minutes (though in 3 sittings).&nbsp; The film constantly interrupts itself with titles, suggesting it was a really messy edit; there's not much of a story told and the in-game aspects of the people are more entertaining than what is focused on the most.&nbsp; A film like this practically makes itself, which is why I wish the filmmaker would have given just a bit more effort and made something really good.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />15 March 2008<br />Be Kind Rewind<br />Michel Gondry, USA, 2008<br />Location: Odeon Braehead<br />Format: 35mm film in theatre<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>Gondry's followup to the wonderful and sublime <em>The Science of Sleep</em> is a cute, family-oriented farce that manages to stay charming and amusing throughout it's duration.&nbsp; It's not even 10% of the masterpiece that <em>Sleep</em> was, eschewing any darker themes in favor of a feelgood celebration of small-town eccentricities and the creative process.&nbsp; But, it works, pretty well really - even if at times it just feels like a series of gimmicky set-pieces strung together.&nbsp; The bizarro rendering of Passaic, New Jersey comes across as a whole town of weirdos with learning disabilities, but Gondry keeps changing gears whenever there's danger of it becoming too sentimental.&nbsp; And visually, the run-down East Coast town has never looked more magical. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 March 2008<br />Land of the Dead<br />George A. Romero, Canada / France / USA, 2005<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br />Watched while assembling Car Commercials LPs.&nbsp; I admit I didn't watch this very closely as I was preoccupied with glueing and stamping records, but I did enjoy it.&nbsp; Though there is something definitely shitty about it, it still has that Romero feel and thus doesn't ruin the original trilogy.&nbsp; Maybe it would have benefited from no-names instead of C-list actors, but the violence and gore was decent enough and it was smart to end after 90 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />3 April 2008<br />The Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey<br />Vincent Ward, Australia / New Zealand, 1988<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: Tara<br />Tara remembered this strange children's(?) film from her youth which I had for some reason downloaded last year.&nbsp; We gave it a go and were pleasantly rewarded to find a dark, dreamlike fantasy that is probably too difficult for most children to endure.&nbsp; The narrative is pretty bonkers and it changes gears almost as much as it changes film stock, but it's intelligent, beautiful and dark which is unusual for children's film.&nbsp; The ending is incredibly bleak which is also unusual for a children's film.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 April 2008<br />Metallica: Some Kind of Monster<br />Joe Berlinger / Bruce Sinofsky, USA, 2004<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: Tara for some<br />Though a bit long at 140 minutes, I found it hard to tear myself away from this.&nbsp; I'm no Metallica fan and I spent most of the film laughing at their boneheadedness, especially when writing lyrics.&nbsp; However, I found myself quite compelled by watching their dynamic and I was a bit surprised at how vulnerable they actually are.&nbsp; I still don't understand exactly why they let this film be released, unless they didn't.&nbsp; It's interesting to see the role Bob Rock plays - he is like their father figure, and if theres ever any tension with him it's never shown on screen. There's some incredible moments - the difficult conversation with Dave Mustaine, Lars' ruminations on modern art, and when they go to see Newsted's new band and Newsted leaves before they get to see him.&nbsp; Strangely I found myself actually rooting for them to finish the album and be successful.&nbsp; &quot;My lifestyle determines my deathstyle&quot; and their lifestyle, while certainly scaled back a bit in their 40's, is a lot more placid than I'd have ever guessed.&nbsp; Of course this was extremely edited, and it suffers from the usual effect of having cameras trained on you.&nbsp; I would love to see what didn't make it to the final cut.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 April 2008<br />Blade Runner<br />Ridley Scott, USA / Singapore, 1982<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX<br />Company: none<br />Not sure if this is the director's cut or whatever (it was 1 hr 51 mins) but I haven't seen this since early high school and remembered nothing about it, so it was great to revisit it in the midst of my PK Dick obsession.&nbsp; I don't think I paid as much attention to the unique visual style of this film before; this is a truly stunning sci-fi vision rendered onto film.&nbsp; However, much of what made the novel so interesting was removed from the film.&nbsp; The religious theme of Mercerism with shared pain and empathy was completely removed; the obsession with pets as status symbols is also missing.&nbsp; Also, the alternative police station subplot is gone, which is unnecessary (even by Dick's own notes on the original 1968 option on <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>) but something I really enjoyed.&nbsp; What remains works well as Hollywood entertainment, but not much more.&nbsp; This is often considered the best science-fiction film of all time and I guess it's deserving of the title, but it is merely a futuristic adventure story with great action and visuals, rather than something that engages the mind and soul. <br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2008<br />Martin &#38; Orloff<br />Lawrence Blume, USA, 2002<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />This indie comedy from a few years back is slightly above average, though it suffers from some crude racial stereotypes and a really unimaginative narrative.&nbsp; There's some highlights, by which I mean parts that made me really laugh, and I'm grateful that it stays under 90 minutes. &nbsp; I think this is Upright Citizens people and they do a pretty good job, though I wouldn't run out to see their other projects. <br /><br /><br /><br />9 April 2008<br />Rocket Science<br />Jeffrey Blitz, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: Tara<br />The proliferation of high school movies seems to be at an all-time high - and I don't mean things like <em>Clueless</em>, I mean high school movies for adults. Nor do I mean sex comedies like <em>Superbad</em>; I mean films that grasp at 'serious' adolescent issues and make nostalgic twentysomethings coo and caw because it's portraying the isolation they experienced (or think they experienced) with striking cinematography and a clever soundtrack.&nbsp; I wonder if the 'Stuff White People LIke' blog has already done something on movies about high school? Clearly there's a lot of emotional territory yet unexplored there for the collective mentality of my generation, and it's also an easy way to write a film that everyone can connect to.&nbsp; But I enjoy these films, and I enjoyed this one far more than I expected.&nbsp; I still see <em>Rushmore</em> as the Holy Grail of the genre, but this is a worthy entry.&nbsp; Unlike <em>Juno</em>, it manages to explore some genuine pain, though maybe I just found this easier to connect to from a male point of view.&nbsp; The aspect of divorce recalls <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>, though that film was overt in its discussion of those themes while this one kept it bottled in.&nbsp; But that's why <em>Rocket Science</em> is good - because it's a film about a failure to communicate, and every action committed by the lead character was completely misplaced and distracting from his real problems.&nbsp; The whole debate club plot is not really what the film is 'about'.&nbsp; That all of the other characters were ridiculous characterisations didn't even hurt - if anything it emphasized the stuttering kid's isolation.&nbsp; <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />13 April 2008<br />A Lawyer Walks Into a Bar...<br />Eric Chaikin, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />This documentary about the law profession was thin on substance but heavy on entertainment value.&nbsp; The filmmakers followed several candidates in their struggle to pass the California bar exam, including one man who had failed it 41 times.&nbsp; There's a lot of information about the difficulty of passing the exam, the perks and problems of the profession, and differing opinions on the role of litigationi n American society.&nbsp; No one really comes off as very passionate, and a few of the aspiring lawyers are quite unlikeable.&nbsp; Docu-fluff, sure, but easy to watch while packing records into cardboard boxes.&nbsp; I wonder when I'll ever watch serious film again?<br /><br /><br /><br />15 April 2008<br />The Other Final<br />Johan Kramer, Netherlands / Italy / Japan, 2003<br />Location: bedroom / office<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />This documentary had an interesting premise - during the 2002 World Cup, an exhibition match was set up between Bhutan and Montserrat, the two lowest ranked FIFA squads.&nbsp; The premise is about as good as it gets - since then they have to fill 90 minutes with nothing at all.&nbsp; Apart from some beautiful scenes of the Bhutanese people, there wasn't much substance to hold my interest.&nbsp; By the time the actual match came, I didn't even care who won and I was just glad I wouldn't have to hear the Montserratese &quot;Hot Hot Hot&quot; song again. <br /><br /><br /><br />15 April 2008<br />Smothered: The Censorship Struggles of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour<br />Maureen Muldaur, USA, 2002<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />Another easy watch while packing records and working on some code, but this was totally great.&nbsp; I'm really interested in that period of American comedy (due in part to the WFMU blog's excellent posts on the topic) and this documentary made me totally respect the Smothers Brothers.&nbsp; In fact, they're pretty fascinating though I would have liked to have seen tales about Mason Williams and how fucked up and weird all the writers were (Bob Einstein!&nbsp; Don Novello!&nbsp; Steve Martin!).&nbsp; This doesn't make me want to see much of the show itself but I am definitely curious about checking out some stuff by The Committee to see how it holds up.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 April 2008<br />Loose Change<br />Thomas Hefferon, Ireland, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: streamed over Google Video<br />Company: Porter<br />Porter and I were talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories and decided to watch this, which I find as entertaining as it is nonfactual.&nbsp; Actually this has been revised since the last time I saw it, so it took some of the more entertaining nonsense out. <br /><br /><br /><br />7 May 2008<br />The Darjeeling Limited<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />I was afraid I would feel less enthusiastic about this film the second time through (like I did with <em>The Life Aquatic</em>) but this was not the case; I loved this as much, if not more, than the first time.&nbsp; Watching it on a smaller screen took away a lot of the visual splendour that may have occupied my senses in the cinema; instead I focused on the performances of the actors.&nbsp; Adrian Brody in particular is strange and wooden and intense and it's a magnificent performance; Schrwartzmann and Wilson may be going through the motions a bit but it serves the artifice of the film.&nbsp; I need to watch this a few more times but right now I'm feeling more of a resonance with this film than any of Anderson's other work, meaning this could potentially pip <em>Bottle Rocket</em> out of my personal pantheon.&nbsp; I was thinking about how Anderson's worlds are becoming progressively more small and self-contained - from the school campus of <em>Rushmore</em> to the Tennenbaum house to the Zizou boat and now to a railway train.&nbsp; I think the sharper focus is evident throughout this film, which still&nbsp; walks over the same pathways he always walks over but with a slight bit more cynicism than before.&nbsp; There's no fairy-tale ending here, but the sense that we have seen a snapshot of experience.&nbsp; As always we have characters of extreme prvilege, unconcerned with realistic problems like money and work (besides Francis flipping out about his $3,000 shoe being stolen).&nbsp; And while this upper class fantasy should irritate the Marxist in me, I think my love of Anderson's films extends beyond criticism.&nbsp; Again my personal travels through India make this resonate more; I was seeking some sort of 'experience' that could not be obtained in my own culture, just like these brothers; and like them, I didn't find anything I expected.&nbsp; The 'death' in this film, as I probably commented the first time I saw this, is less heavy-handed than in the last two films, and subsequently provides a better anchor for the plot.&nbsp; And I also probably said before that the funeral/village scenes are the most moving sequences Anderson has ever shot, but I'm happy to say it again.&nbsp; I didn't watch <em>Hotel Chevalier</em> this time through; I don't know if I needed to again. &nbsp;  <br /><br /><br /><br />17 May 2008<br />Militainment, Inc. - The Militarization of Pop Culture<br />Roger Stahl, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom / studio<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />This documentary updates 'The Selling of the Pentagon' for the 24-hour news channel age, looking at the entertainment value of war and specifically at Iraq war coverage.&nbsp; Though this type of media criticism is pretty readily available, this film manages to weave everything into one place, with an incredible amount of footage to back up its viewpoint.&nbsp; It has a very amateurish style, with Dr. Stahl standing in front of a blue screen and narrating throughout, but that's exactly what is needed in a film that criticizes the excessive style of CNN and Fox News.&nbsp; The sections on toys and sports are particularly good, both as a dissection of public rhetoric and as a wakeup call to American viewers.&nbsp; Its a bit like preaching to the converted (for me to watch this) but it's still shocking to me how no one ever questions this type of presentation (apart from <em>The Daily Show</em>, which is referenced a few times).&nbsp; Great!<br /><br /><br /><br />18 May 2008<br />Scum<br />Alan Clarke, UK, 1979<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />As much as I like <em>If...</em>, this is a far more brutal and realistic portrait of youth in Britain.&nbsp; Only here they are incarcerated as juvenile offenders, and the portrayal is bleak and horrifying, without any avant-garde flourishes.&nbsp; This clearly belongs to that school of social realist films in Britain that came around in the late 70's and early 80's, and while I found this to be a fascinating viewing, I can't say I'd ever want to endure it again.&nbsp; <br />The characters of Carling and especially Archer really offer a lot of hope, which is of course brutally repressed by the racist, authoritarian system that I'm sure really existed when this was made.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 May 2008<br />Advise &#38; Consent<br />Otto Preminger, USA, 1962<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />This is a great political thriller that is strikingly relevant today.&nbsp; It reminds me a lot of Frankenheimer's <em>Seven Days in May</em> but has flourishes of melodrama, such as the overly long sequence where the Utah senator and his wife are crying.&nbsp; The evil Southern conservative senator and the pragatic president fill the stereotypes nicely; it's amazing how little things have actually changed.&nbsp; The film of course ends with a great celebration of patriots doing their duty and upholding the constitution, though in a Hollywood liberal way. <br /><br /><br /><br />23 May 2008<br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull<br />Steven Spielberg, USA, 2008<br />Location: UGC<br />Format: 35mm film in theatre<br />Company: Tara<br />Tara took me to see this for our first anniversary.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun sitting in a theatre and watching this even though it was shitty.&nbsp; I mean, there's little point in being critical of a fantasy action-adventure movie, and a lot of my disappointment comes from my own neo-Luddite aesthetics and the general dissatisfaction with filmic wonder at age 28, in the era of detached ironic post-everything.&nbsp; But even playing by Speilberg's own rules there were some things that annoyed me about this, like Harrison Ford's wooden acting and the obsessive attempts to situate the film in the late 50's zeitgeist (the diner scene, Shia LaBeuf's frantic hair-combing, 'I like Ike,' etc.).&nbsp; It is pretty goofy that this film glorifies that whacked-out theories of Erich Von Daniken, and begins to make a point about McCarthyism but steps back and decides it's okay to portray the Soviet empire as robotic totaliarian torturers.&nbsp; Also, what was with the accents?&nbsp; Cate Blanchett (who I have never been impressed with as an actress) didn't even try, when all she had to do was mimic Natasha from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show.&nbsp; You think with 15 scriptwriters they could been a little bit more focused - it actually felt haphazardly so - careless in some areas but then overly focused on others.&nbsp; I will say that the scene where Indy and the kid go to the old burial site and find the grave of the old explorer is one of my favorite scenes of any Indiana Jones movie - it was perfect, exactly what these films should be like.&nbsp; The scene where the kid was swinging through the trees with monkeys was so awful that it canceled out the good scene.&nbsp; Also I hated how Karen Allen intentionally drove onto the elastic tree - I mean, WTF?&nbsp; Is this Lucas and Spielberg trying to force suspension of disbelief, in some vain attempt to bring America back to the golden age where they found their success?&nbsp; I'll keep my ironic distance and repeatedly watch Wes Anderson films instead.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 May 2008<br />The Big Lebowski<br />Joel Coen / Ethan Coen, USA / UK, 1998<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX, projected on wall<br />Company: Tara<br />Tara had somehow never seen this, so this was rectified.&nbsp; Enjoyed with White Russians.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 May 2008<br />Recount<br />Jay Roach, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom and office<br />Format: Divx on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>As made-for-TV movies go, this is the <em>Citizen Kane</em>.&nbsp; HBO retells the 36 days after the Bush/Gore election from the point of view of the campaign staffs, and it doesn't pretend to be unbiased.&nbsp; The cast is astounding for a TV movie, including Kevin Spacey, Bob Balaban (who probably got a huge kick out of playing a Bush guy), Denis Leary and Ed Begley, Jr.&nbsp; The minutiae of the election laws are explained as clearly as possible given the format and time restrictions, and the battle unfolds in a way that makes it every bit as frustrating as when it actually happened.&nbsp; Laura Dern plays Katherine Harris in a cartoonish, silly manner but it works to mock her for the horrible, evil piece of shit that she is.&nbsp; One criticism - not enough time is spent dwelling on the illegal purging of black voters from the Florida rolls, which is truly the greatest&nbsp; crime of this electoral mess.&nbsp; Watching this practically brought tears to my eyes as I relived the national nightmare.&nbsp; That one rigged election could lead to 8 years of misery and suffering (and death) for so many people is almost hard to believe.&nbsp; I would like to see a similar film about the less talked about (but, in my opinion, equally rigged) 2004 election in Ohio. I got angry at Democrats again too, not just for letting this happen but for not stopping Bush from doing everything he has done - he was never legitimately elected, and therefore he has never had any sort of mandate - in fact, they never even talked about his illegitimacy when campaigning.&nbsp; It almost makes me think the whole Florida thing was part of a big conspiracy to launch the Iraq war and reap incredible profits, like they did.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I wonder how they'll steal it this year?&nbsp; It will certainly be harder but I'm sure they'll find a way. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 June 2008<br />An Unreasonable Man<br />Henriette Mantel / Steve Skrovan, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This documentary on Ralph Nader did little to dissuade me from my admiration for him.&nbsp; He is simply one of the greatest Americans who's ever lived, and I will argue to my dying breath that Al Gore cost Al Gore the election in 2000.&nbsp; The filmmakers clearly admire him as well, yet attempted to give time to his detractors.&nbsp; This worked well as a counterpoint to <em>Recount</em> the other day; maybe I am doomed to dwell in the past.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 June 2008<br />Nightwatching<br />Peter Greenaway, Canada / France / Germany / Poland / Netherlands / UK, 2007<br />Location: bedroom and office<br />Format: DivX on TV and projector<br />Company: none<br />I approach a Greenaway film differently than I approach other films, due to my interest and previous study of his work.&nbsp; This is the first new work of his since <em>The Tulse Luper Suitcases</em>, and it appears to be a return to his early-80's style of filmmaking, specifically&nbsp;t<em>The Draughtsman's Contract</em>.&nbsp; As a biopic of Rembrandt, Greenaway does well - he renders the actors and sets in a perfect manner, where every frame could be an actual Rembrandt painting - and manages to actually keep me engaged in a narrative that I'm not particularly interested in.<br /><br />I actually see this is a logical followup to <em>Tulse Luper</em>; if the <em>Suitcases</em> project re-evaluated all of the obsessions and themes in Greenaway's early experimental work, <em>Nightwatching</em> revisits many themes from his first feature-length films.&nbsp; Most obvious of these is the murder mystery within an artwork plotline, which is straight from <em>Draughtman's.</em>&nbsp; But additionally, there is the theme of an artist struggling to assert his freedom despite the intentions of his patrons - surely a theme familiar to Stourley Kracklite in <em>The Belly of an Architect</em>.&nbsp; And though it's unavoidable when making a film about Dutch painting, there is a constant dance with lighting, looking at how illumination creates art (as seen in <em>A Zed and Two Noughts</em> and, well, every other Greenaway film). <br />But this isn't just a re-tread - there is a human warmth missing from many of Greenaway's films, and quite a lot of ruminations on the nature of the Dutch character, national identity and patriotism.&nbsp; Maybe this is a result of Greenaway's own age, and his own experiences living in Holland.&nbsp; Furthermore, Rembrandt's unease of portraying the Amsterdam militia has parallels in today's war-driven culture, and asks questions of the relationship between art and war.<br />Despite all of these ideas, after the encyclopediac density of the <em>Suitcases,</em> one can't help but feel that this is a more relaxed, low-key film - almost like something Greenaway made to unwind after the ambition of his last (unfinished, or perpetually ongoing) project. <br /><br /><br /><br />8 June 2008<br />For Your Consideration<br />Christopher Guest, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />I enjoy all of Christopher Guest's work so this was familiar territory, despite leaving the boundaries of the fake documentary.&nbsp; The same hilarious cast found in his last few films appears here, portraying a story of a low-budget art film that gets hyped up for an Oscar.&nbsp; I'm usually not interested in Hollywood-insider kinda things and this was no exception, but the chuckles produced by Shearer, Willard, McKean, Don Lake, and Ricky Gervais were enough to keep me going.&nbsp; I don't know if this has as much reviewing value as <em>Best in Show</em> but I never have time to see things more than once now anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 June 2008<br />Fight Club<br />David Fincher, USA / Germany, 1999<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: Tara<br />Downloaded shitty DivX rip that had great picture quality but really intermittent sound that flowed in and out.&nbsp; Tara had never seen this and I feel it is essential for capturing the spirit of America just before 9/11.&nbsp; I was on allergy meds and drank a few beers while watching so it felt even more surreal.&nbsp; What a great film - I really do think there is something to it, which is more than I can say for most Hollywood productions.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 June 2008<br />Highlander<br />Russell Mulcahy, USA / UK, 1986<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: Tara for some<br /><em>Highlander</em> ... well, it was a lot more violent than I imagined and it was slightly perverse to cast Sean Connery, an actual Sctosman, as a Spaniard (or Egyptian, or something).&nbsp; However I found myself pretty uninterested in the story and I struggled to hear the poor sound mix which was dominated by synthy 80's Queen and action sounds, with dialogue getting a short shrift.&nbsp; By the time he actually saves the universe of becomes God or whatever the hell happens, I'd lost interest and was just waiting for it to be over.&nbsp; Still, the 80's were a time of interesting aesthetics (and strong too) and it was nice seeing that castle that I went to with my parents.&nbsp; I don't think I could stomach the sequels or TV series, though I'm slightly curious what the plot would be.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 July 2008<br />Un homme qui dort<br />Bernard Queysanne, France / Tunisia, 1974<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX via projector<br />Company: none<br />What could be better than a Perec novel, adapted into a feature-length film?&nbsp; This has never been one of my favorite works by Perec, but when transformed to the screen it becomes a powerful and intense existential voyage that manages to do a lot with very little.&nbsp; The soundtrack is great, and mixed at a very low level below the narration, so the electronic/synth rumbles are more suggestive than direct.&nbsp; Given the format of this film it's amazing that is is so compelling; what the visuals add to the Perec text is the total immersion in the city of Paris.&nbsp; The city here is portrayed as very lonely, with most other people shown in the negative filmstock sequences.&nbsp; The tone never strays from very serious, though there are elements of Perec's playfulness that emerge to the surface- the closeups of the food, the socks in the washbasin - things that aren't exactly celebrating the tapestry of life but indicate an attentiveness to objects.&nbsp; The ending is invigorating, with it's final shot rippling under the close credits; it's a sideway celebration of life that comes after the repudiation of everything else, but rather than be overt it just sinks in slowly.&nbsp; I'm not sure why this has lingered in obscurity for so long - perhaps it's the semi-experimental nature of the film, with it's dictated non-narrative - but thankfully now its' been restored to digital DVD glory.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 July 2008<br />The Nude Bomb<br />Clive Donner, USA, 1980<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX via projector<br />Company: none<br />Reverse Shot ran a great review of the new <em>Get Smart</em> movie which actualy made me want to see it, but it doesn't open in the UK til the night we move to Finland, and then in Finland not for another week after that.&nbsp; So I downloaded this to satisfy the desire, as I was quite a fan of the TV show as a kid.&nbsp; This film has a bad reputation and it's easy to see why - it's terrible.&nbsp; It actually feels a lot like an episode of the TV show strethed out to feature length, but it doesn't work over an extended period.&nbsp; Don Adams manages to drop all of his catchphrases in the first five minutes and the story fails to maintain my interest despite my preparation for shitty campyness.&nbsp; I can see how Steve Carrell is a perfect fit for the role, even without seeing it - in fact, I think he's a far more versatile actor and will probably actually develop the part a good bit.&nbsp; There's not much else I have to say about <em>The Nude Bomb</em> except that it managed to pass the time this evening, while I drank cheap champagne to celebrate the death of Jesse Helms.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />6 July 2008<br />Lost Highway<br />David Lynch, France / USA, 1997<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX via projector<br />Company: none<br />I've been in a rather unusual film watching mood this weekend and I thought I'd ride it out by checking out <em>Lost Highway</em> which I had never seen before.&nbsp; I was afraid it would be something like <em>Wild at Heart</em> but it was much closer to <em>Mulholland Drive </em>in its style of surrealism, ambiguity and horror.&nbsp; I enjoyed this, despite the length; it shows its' French production influence and maybe it works if thought of as a trilogy with <em>Mullholland</em> and <em>Inland Empire</em>.&nbsp; In the past, I've disliked some of Lynch's work because his aesthetics clash so much with mine; if I accept our differences, his films are a lot more rewarding and maybe I will even enjoy something I hated as much as <em>Wild at Heart</em> now.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 July 2008<br />A Perfect Couple<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1979<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This is one of the lesser Altman films I've seen, but that's mostly due to the musical component.&nbsp; The extremely thin narrative would have been a boon in any other circumstance, as it would have allowed a freer-flowing improvisational vibe to develop.&nbsp; But with crummy show music interrupting, no cinematic syncopation can happen.&nbsp; I was hoping for at least one great Altman scene where everything totally goes off the rails, and the film threatens to spiral out of control - scenes that occur in most of his best films - but it was not to be.&nbsp; I wrote a blog post that's a good bit lengthier, on this topic. <br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2008<br />Couple t&#233;moin, Le<br />William Klein, France / Switzerland, 1977<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This awesome farce had the same ultra-artificial look that <em>Mr. Freedom</em> had, yet a slightly more coherent storyline.&nbsp; It sends up everything - consumerism, psychology, statistics, political activism, the media - and keeps jumping around like a series of brilliantly conceived set pieces.&nbsp; The actors are actually pretty good given the ridiculous nature of the film.&nbsp; I think I actually liked this more than <em>Mr. Freedom</em> because instead of just being &quot;crazy&quot;, it was actually pretty stimulating.&nbsp; That undefinable &quot;thing&quot;, the approach and irreverance that I constantly look for in films, is here; this is 1977 and about as late as anything I've seen that contains &quot;it&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2008<br />Glengarry Glen Ross<br />James Foley, USA, 1992<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This is the play/film that Mamet's reputation is based on, and it's easy to see why - it's an engaging, edgy script that is performed by some extremely talented actors.&nbsp; The rhytmic quality of Mamet's dialogue isn't as obviously metronomic as in later films, and he doesn't stray from his strong areas.&nbsp; Though Wrestling Team were sorta right when they suggested the film can be reduced to people saying 'Leads' for 2 hours, I dug this.&nbsp; It's a million times better than <em>Heist</em>, at least.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2008<br />War, Inc.<br />Joshua Seftel, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />Here we have a completely over-the-top satire of the Iraq War, specifically targetting Halliburton and the immense corporate profiteering that resulted from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Leyner co-wrote the script, which should say a lot.&nbsp; John Cusack is&nbsp; doing the <em>Grosse Point Blank</em> deal again. except injected with a huge amount of steroids and a few psychedelics.&nbsp; The ridiculousness of it all goes down smoothly due to good editing (including some pretty decent action/fight sequences) and a witty script, which feels more like David Foster Wallace than Leyner.&nbsp; As far as political impact, it chooses exaaggeration over nuance, which is probably for the bettter because it's more fun that way.&nbsp; I would have probably been completely amazed that something this whacked-out could be made, except after seeing <em>Southland Tales</em> this only seems moderately insane. The PK Dick visions are multiplying in cinema these days, and converging with what I see on TV.&nbsp; I wonder what this will feel like in five or ten years.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2008<br />Idiocracy<br />Mike Judge, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedoom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />I thought this was about as good as <em>Office Space</em>, which means it was funny but I wouldn't ever watch it again.&nbsp; It was a bit by-the-books. though some ideas were quite clever and I always have a soft spot for Luke Wilson thanks to <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, no matter how many crummy romantic comedies he may do.&nbsp; In 2505 I would think that races would be totally miscegenated beyond recognition, but I guess it's stupid to criticize a film like this for not being believable.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />21 July 2008<br />Taxi to the Dark Side<br />Alex Gibney, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />This documentary is an indictment of the Bush administration's use of torture, expanding on the Abu Ghraib controversy to show the systematic involvement of the highest levels of the military and executive establishments.&nbsp; My watching this is 'preaching to the converted', of course, but I dug it, so who cares?&nbsp; Stylistically it was pretty straightforward, but it used music superbly - whether it's ominous dark soundtracky stuff while describing the arrest of innocent taxi drivers - or Yo La Tengo's sweet &quot;My Little Corner of the World&quot; used for ironic effect - or just creepy kalimba music that kept popping up.&nbsp; There's an upsetting factor to this film, with torture photographs displayed often enough to unsettle any stomach.&nbsp; I also liked seeing John McCain's passionate anti-torture rhetoric, which makes it all the more sad that he's changed his tune on it to appeal to the conservative base.&nbsp; Reading Baudrillard's <em>America</em> concurrently to watching this made it more fun, though his 1980's travelogue is relatively innocent compared to the utter misery infllicted upon the world by Bush/Cheney/Rumsfelde/etc.&nbsp; While there's a glut of films in this mold lately, I hope people never stop making them.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 July 2008<br />Batman Begins<br />Christopher Nolan, USA, 2005<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />I thought I'd catch up to the first new Batman film which I meant to see 3 years ago and forgot about.&nbsp; It's interesting how my time in Glasgow is bookended by Batman films.&nbsp; This was good, despite Katie Holmes who is an absolutely talentless actress, and the usual superhero stuff which I guess I should expect being that it's a superhero film.&nbsp; Christian Bale didn't really impress me but Michael Caine is cool in anything so I dug this.&nbsp; But given the hype surrounding the new film (which is next week in the UK) I could only think about it, not the one I was watching.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 July 2008<br />Home Movies<br />Brian De Palma, USA, 1980<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />WEIRD FILM.&nbsp; After finding out that De Palma made it with a bunch of students it makes a bit more sense.&nbsp; I think it was shot on 16mm or else it's just the worst DVD transfer ever.&nbsp; This film is strange because I don't really understand it's purpose.&nbsp; It has some weird metafictional elements, but not really and not enough to be noteworthy.&nbsp; Kirk Douglas is pretty great whenever he's on camera and it's pretty weird to see him in a student film parody.&nbsp; Vincent Gardenia is in it though, playing the same character as in <em>Little Murders</em>, so that's a winner.&nbsp; God, I can't stop thinking about this.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />26 July 2008<br />Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters<br />Matt Maiellaro / Dave Willis, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />The Aqua Teen feature spinoff is great.&nbsp; It plays pretty much like a long episode of the show, but that's OK.&nbsp; In fact, I would have been happy if it was longer.&nbsp; There's a bit of swearing that couldn't exist in the show, but not too much.&nbsp; The story of the genesis of the characters is told, not that it really matters; Neil Peart plays a miniature version of himself too.&nbsp; This will definitely hold up under repeated viewings.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />26 July 2008<br />There Will Be Blood<br />Paul Thomas Anderson, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />PT Anderson's highly acclaimed film doesn't come close to the greatness of <em>Punch Drunk Love</em> though it's beautifully shot, with some very compelling dramatic moments.&nbsp; It coulda been half an hour shorter; I'm really annoyed at how so many &quot;big&quot; films these days are over 2 hours, especially if it's a &quot;serious&quot; auteur.&nbsp; Paul Dano was excellent though I thought it was the kid who plays Liam McPoyle from <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> through the entire film.&nbsp; I don't understand the hype about Tom Selleck's performance in the lead role; he was awful, and his stupid voice was probably the hardest thing for me to deal with.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 July 2008<br />The Dark Knight<br />Christopher Nolan, USA, 2008<br />Location: Odeon Glasgow Quay<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: none<br /><p>I went to see the highly-acclaimed Batman sequel with high expectations, inflated by the superlatives thrown at it by friends, mainstream media and blogs.&nbsp; What nobody warned me about was how incredibly long the film would be.&nbsp; I know it says 152 minutes, but it felt more like 4 hours.&nbsp; During the whole Two-face act I thought that maybe I had jumped ahead in time and I was watching the next film, and that my entire life in between the end of <em>The Dark Knight</em> and the beginning of, um, <em>The Darker Knight</em> were lost due to superhero-induced amnesia.&nbsp; But alas, it was just one film, which improved on <em>Batman Begins</em> through the much ballyhooed Heath Ledger performance and the removal of Katie Holmes.<br />Though actually, due to the excessive length and the stupid celphone surveillance control center, I may actually prefer <em>Batman Begins </em>to this one.&nbsp; It's undeniable that Chris Nolan has constructed the most satisfying, complete take on the superhero genre that I've seen.&nbsp; However, it's still a superhero genre; nothing can take away from the fact that the premise is inherently idiotic, and you have to make a man running around in a rubber bat costume with a bunch of sci-fi gadgets compelling.&nbsp; Ledger's Joker provided enough entertainment to propel my attention through all 152 minutes, but it's still ridiculous.&nbsp; And I was sad to see Comissioner Gordon elevated into more 'heroic' status, for he previously struck me as the David Simon hero in the <em>Batman</em> franchise - a rumpled, mid-level bureaucrat stuck within the system and trying to do the best he could.&nbsp; The action sequences were done well, but there were just too many - there weren't enough reminders of Batman's fallibility, and after 50 consecutive close shaves they lose their impact.&nbsp; I was prepared for little to no CGI, but there was enough to make it look like a video game (specifically when the truck gets flipped over).&nbsp; <br />OK, maybe this was the best superhero film ever but to paraphrase Jim McIntyre, &quot;that's like saying someone is the smartest heavy metal guitarist ever&quot;.&nbsp; Next time I'm in a bad movie mood I may go back and ingest the Val Kilmer and George Clooney Batman films that I've never seen, just for the sae of comparison.&nbsp; They'rel surely be shorter than this, so that's one major point over <em>The Dark Knight</em>, which I don't think I could ever stand to sit through again.  </p><br /><br /><br /><br />3 August 2008<br />This Film Is Not Yet Rated<br />Kirby Dick, UK / USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />This expose of the MPAA's bullshit ratings board is overly stylised and spends half the time trying to make an exciting detective story by showing private investigators writing down license plate numbers.&nbsp; It's great someone is trying to take these fuckers on, but it's a pointless cause thanks to the corporate stranglehold on America.&nbsp; It addresses the sexual double standards well but it didn't explore the pressure to make films like Batman and Lord of the Rings PG-13 - it goes on and on about the financial suicide of an NC-17 rating, but not the R/PG-13 divide for films with younger audiences.&nbsp; This was recommended by a coworker when I was ranting about how fucked up it was that 12 year olds could see the new Batman film, which was insanely violent.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />7 August 2008<br />Running with Scissors<br />Ryan Murphy, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />The inevitable film adaptation of Burroughs's memoir is well-cast, but ultimately limp.&nbsp; Annette Bening is the brightest spot of this otherwise unnecessary film.&nbsp; The book is adhered to pretty closely, but the screen treatement fails to capture the perfect balance of comedy and horror that makes the memoir so compelling.&nbsp; What results is a weird emotional &quot;middle ground&quot; - a film that seems unwilling to take chances and feels superfluous after you've read the book.&nbsp; In that sense, it reminded me of the pointless film adaptation of <em>Everything is Illuminated</em>.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />9 August 2008<br />Northfork<br />Michael Polish, USA, 2003<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />I had extremely fond memories from seeing this a few years ago and I felt like spending a lazy Saturday afternoon watching it again, instead of doing anytihng responsible like packing.&nbsp; This is such a beautiful, lyrical work that has stunning American landscape cinematography and a soundtrack that I would think was bland if it didn't work so perfectly with the images and pacing of the film.&nbsp; The fantasy-based narrative is such an aesthetically-focused dream that the details of the plot become irrelevant.&nbsp; The acting has a bit of that Guy Maddin style disconnect which I'm normally not keen on, but I like slipping into the whole surrounding world of the film so everything ultimately works.&nbsp; I had lunch with someone last week who was saying how <em>Celine and Julie</em> was one of their favorite films when they were younger, but he had recently watched it again and found it tedious, as the surrealistic elements no longer appealed to his older self.&nbsp; I've been wondering if I will 'mature' out of surrealism or if I will always be drawn to works of the imagination.&nbsp; With the preponderance of surreal images in just about everything these days, the shock is certainly gone, and I must admit that something like <em>The Wire</em> is more powerful and amazing because of its realism.&nbsp; But then the part of me that stirs and wants to create is activated by films like <em>Northfork</em> or <em>Celine et Julie</em>.&nbsp; I was glad that this film, which seems to have slipped under most people's radar, still had the ability to provoke my imagination in that way.&nbsp; I need to check out these guys' other films finally.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 August 2008<br />The Happening<br />M. Night Shyamalan, USA / India, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />I've only ever seen <em>Unbreakable</em>, but it was so shitty I've never wanted to see anything else that Syhamalan ever made.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the unified negative reaction to this film piqued my interest, as I always wonder if maybe someone is doing something right when there's 100% negative critical reaction.&nbsp; Sadly, this was not to be - <em>The Happening</em> is 'just' terrible, without any redeeming features.&nbsp; I can't even think of anything clever to write about it here - it was an absolute waste of time and I should have been studying Finnish or practicing music or doing anything else instead of watching this.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2008<br />...All the Marbles<br />Robert Aldrich, USA, 1981<br />Location: bedroom and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV and monitor<br />Company: none<br />Bad movie weekend!&nbsp; I am always fascinated by Hollywood misfires, especially when previously well-regarded filmmakers go bonkers and make films that are both critical and box office disasters.&nbsp; Now, I'm no expert on Robert Aldritch but I know he was very well-regarded in his heyday, and this, his final film, is pretty much disowned by his fans.&nbsp; This appeals to my perverse sense of film scholarship, especially when Peter Falk is involved.&nbsp; This is a story of two female wrestlers as they climb to the top, managed by Falk whose performance dominates the picture, even though he's phoning it in like it's a Columbo episode.&nbsp; There is a great deal of female wrestling in this film, during which I was extremely bored.&nbsp; The scenes in between don't really make the pain any more bearable, yet somehow I did enjoy this film overall.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because it has that early 80's shine to it, that total mess like <em>Fever Pitch</em> had, except this was far less glamorous, taking place in small midwestern venues and crappy motels.&nbsp; Plus, Mean Joe Greene has a cameo (playing himself).&nbsp; This is definitely one to schedule for the <em>Early 80's WTF---??? Film Festival</em>, whenever that may occur.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 August 2008<br />Helvetica<br />Gary Hustwit, UK, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />I wasn't blown away by this documentary, but then again, it's a feature-length film about a typeface so what did I expect?&nbsp; I think graphic designers irritate me on some sort of personal level; this was watching a whole film of talking heads talking about a font so I should have known what I was in for.&nbsp; The Raygun guy actually came across as the most likeable of then, even though the film is highly critical of his 'grunge' style.&nbsp; I wanted to hear people whining about how crap Arial is, but there wasn't any of that - maybe on the DVD outtakes? <br /><br /><br /><br />15 August 2008<br />Mister Lonely<br />Harmony Korine, UK / France / Ireland / USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV<br />Company: none<br />Korine's fantasy was beautifully shot and had several brilliant scenes that were absolutely unclassifiable.&nbsp; I don't know how I felt about the film as a whole, partially because I had trouble fitting it into a critical framework.&nbsp; Is it a fairy tale, a moral allegory, a wry comment on postmodern simulacra or something else?&nbsp; It felt like a feature film version of the art of Jeff Koons or somebody like that; it explored ideas of faith, identity, performance and celebrity but didn't take a clear stance on anything.&nbsp; Werner Herzog and the nuns were the highlight for me but the agrarian community created by the main characters looked disturbingly appealing at certain moments.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 August 2008<br />Get Smart<br />Peter Segal, USA, 2008<br />Location: UGC, Renfrew St<br />Format: 35mm film in cinema<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>This film was totally awesome in every way.&nbsp; Most updated film remakes are not of interest to me, but I worshipped Get Smart when I was 10, and this had Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin in it, so I was psyched.&nbsp; So psyched that we went to the first showing of the very first day it opened -&nbsp; and it far exceeded my expectations.&nbsp; The humour was fairly mild, but it worked really well, being a very satisfying Hollywood action-comedy movie that managed to lampoon the Bush administration and take a rather humanistic view of the War on Terror.&nbsp; There was a real compassion in Carrell's portrayal; for once overweight characters are empowered and dignified instead of used as laughing stocks, in a scene that was actually pretty amazing.&nbsp; This really could have been awful in so many ways;&nbsp; I wonder to what extent Carrell was able to influence it.&nbsp; I would even say that it outdoes Don Adams's own portrayal, though obviously he invented the character - Carrell is a more versatile actor and manages to deliver the classic catchphrases without it becoming tired.&nbsp; Maybe it's because the last of the original Get Smart I saw was <em>The Nude Bomb</em>, which is fucking terrible, but this just seemed like an improvement on the original.&nbsp; It was totally perfect for mainstream entertainment - I just hope they don't make a sequel. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 September 2008<br />HealtH<br />Robert Altman, USA, 1980<br />Location: our studio/bedroom/basement/warerhouse/whatever it is<br />Format: bad video rip in DivX on laptop screen<br />Company: none<br />This was on my list of &quot;must-see&quot; Altmans for a long time, and my KG request was *finally* filled so I watched this with great excitement.&nbsp; It's not amazing - it's not even really good - I would rank it right in the middle or slightly below the average in the Altman ouvre, actually.&nbsp; Paul Dooley, Carol Burnett and Glenda Jackson are the high points of a generally uneven cast; I can kinda see where this was supposed to go as the strange political allegory that Altman is fond of, but the attempt at humour are rather bland and the anarchy cools down after awhile.&nbsp; It's not as funny as <em>M*A*S*H </em>and probably not even as funny as <em>Beyond Therapy</em>; but if you're absolutely obsessed with Altman's work there's still some charms to make this worthwhile.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 September 2008<br />Lady in the Water<br />M. Night Shyamalan, USA, 2006<br />Location: Anthony's Bachelor Pad<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Anthony<br />Everyone savaged this film, and it wasn't Citizen Kane or anything, but I think it's the best M. Night Shyamalan film I've yet seen.&nbsp; Which admittedly isn't saying much -- but if viewed as a fairytale story for kids, it's actually a really nice, low key, arty, imaginative film.&nbsp; Yes, it's a bit dumb, and I would never recommend it or watch it a second time - but compared to the giant deep-fried burger of dogshit that is <em>The Happening</em>, this is actually good.&nbsp; Paul Giamatti and Bob Balaban are better in, well, everything else I've ever seen them in&nbsp; - but this coulda been a lot, lot worse.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 September 2008<br />Burn After Reading<br />Ethan Coen / Joel Coen, France / USA / UK, 2008<br />Location: Southside Works<br />Format: 35mm film in cinema<br />Company: Mom, Dad, Anthony<br />Agent Mule wrote a great review of this which I enjoyed reading and generally agreed with, though I don't think the film was entirely without sympathy - the character who managed the gym was truly likeable and therefore suffered the worst outcome; this of course makes the humour even blacker.&nbsp; Of course the great irony is that Frances McDormand and George Clooney both come out relatively unscathed, and perhaps they can meet again and be happy together - except Clooney probably won't recognize her if they do meet.&nbsp; I can see this one definitely getting better with repeated viewings, as there are lots of nuances in the strong character portrayals.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 October 2008<br />Hancock<br />Peter Berg, USA, 2008<br />Location: Northwest Airlines flight NW40 (Detroit - Amsterdam)<br />Format: heavily edited flickery LCD video<br />Company: none<br />Despite an &quot;on-demand&quot; choice of about 40 films, <em>this</em> was actually the only thing that interested me.&nbsp; I enjoyed this - it's exactly the kinda cute Hollywood film that is good to watch on a long flight - but even moreso because of the editing.&nbsp; All swear words were dubbed over - &quot;Aw shit&quot; became &quot;Aw shucks&quot;, recalling Mr. Show's &quot;Pallies&quot; sketch.&nbsp; Anything resembling violence was edited out, which had the net effect of shortening the film a great deal and making some scenes completely incomprehensible.&nbsp; I figured out that Hancock cut off the dude's hand but I don't think a little kid would have, if they were only subjected to the airplane-censored version.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />9 October 2008<br />Snuff: A Documentary About Killing on Camera<br />Paul von Stoetzel, USA, 2008<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor/laptop<br />Company: none<br />I couldn't fall asleep so i decided to watch an incredibly disturbing documentary about snuff films.&nbsp; This doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already know but does have some pretty extreme footage, though purely for informative purposes and never for exploitation value of its own.&nbsp; The overall tone of the film is very somber, and it's a thoughtful, detailed look at the subject that only goes awry when they digress into a point about the Iraq war and televised war violence.&nbsp; The centerpiece of the film comes from Mark L. Rosen, who talks first of a Russian-based child snuff ring he read about in the newspaper - which if true has had surprisingly little attention - and then finally recounts his own experience encoutering a snuff film in the 70s.&nbsp; Whether it's true or not, the idea of the network of snuff film fans is much more dangerous of an idea than the film itself; it recalls the idea of the global covert state that Virilio describes in <em>Ground Zero.</em><br /><br /><br /><br />23 October 2008<br />Pineapple Express<br />David Gordon Green, USA, 2008<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />This Apatow film had some great comedic moments, such as every time Danny McBride was on screen, yet it failed overall to stand up against even Apatow's own other work.&nbsp; The action movie plot was a perfectly acceptable premise, but the gunfights and chase scenes weighed down the film, even as they tried to inject humour into them.&nbsp; Of course, I expected more from David Gordon Green.&nbsp; I saw nothing in this film that hinted it was made by anything more than a standard Hollywood comedy director, except some of the lighting at the end when the building blows up.&nbsp; Maybe he just needed the work, or maybe he's lost his touch.&nbsp; Still, for something I could lie on the couch and laugh at and drink some beers, it was more than adequate.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 October 2008<br />Juno<br />Jason Reitman, USA, 2007<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on laptop<br />Company: Tara<br />I was thinking about watching this again, and Tara hadn't seen it, so we got in bed and put this on.&nbsp; I don't know why I was so keen to watch it again as I wasn't that wild about it the first time through; the second time was even less enjoyable, though again it's a perfectly <em>pleasant</em> film.&nbsp; I think Jennifer Garner was really excellent in this and I still found myself laughing a few times, yet twice is enough.&nbsp; It's always nice to watch something with Tara cause it happens so rarely.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 October 2008<br />Step Brothers<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2008<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />Low expectations were greatly exceeded.&nbsp; Of course this wasn't up to the quality of <em>Anchorman</em> (what is?) but it was far better than the NASCAR one.&nbsp; I wouldn't watch this again but these films are perfect for nights like this when I'm a bit under the weather and already watched something 'smart'.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 October 2008<br />King Corn<br />Aaron Woolf, USA, 2007<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br />After reading <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> I downloaded this documentary about the corn industry, which has some brief interview clips with Michael Pollan.&nbsp; Though this was essentially the film version of the first 1/3 of the book, it was extremely well done. The filmmakers actually did wonders with the cinematography, despite a fairly low budget; the grainy video and super 8 footage is a marvelous for reflecting Iowa cornfields and countryside.&nbsp; They injected a slight bit of the personal approach, which I think is pretty unavoidable if you are under 35 and making a documentary film, but they were very restrained in this category.&nbsp; They also managed to be critical of the industry without being overtly polemical.&nbsp; The more I think about this, the more impressed I am; it feels odd to totally gush over a documentary about corn, yet this is pretty fantastic and I would even watch it again.<br /><br /><br /><br />31 October 2008<br />Frag<br />Mike Pasley, USA, 2008<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>Pretty boring, if not terrible documentary about professional video game players.&nbsp; I don't know why I thought I would be interested in this - I am into the history of video games but this was really about modern teenage pros and the lifestyles they lead.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2008<br />Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?<br />Morgan Spurlock, France / USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom/studio<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br />Company: none<br />What a shitty documentary.&nbsp; I actually kinda liked <em>Super Size Me</em>, though I thought the filmmaker was a bit of a loser.&nbsp; This followup never once teased me into believing the premise, which is that Spurlock would actually encounter Osama Bin Laden or any actual terrorist whatosever.&nbsp; Instead it turns into a liberal wet dream - a successive series of interviews with everyday Moslems, continually showing their - gasp! - humanity, and how post-9/11 terrorism is actually a slightly more complex issue than we've made it out to be.&nbsp; The film is peppered with obnoxious video game graphics and cute moments, and one almost wishes for someone to take a potshot at Spurlock, not for being an American imperialist but for making a shitty documentary film.&nbsp; The ending is even weaker than I expected - I knew there'd be some copout, but he doesn't even try to save face .&nbsp; Absolutely shit and I couldn't wait for it to be over and I would have turned it off but I wanted to see if it would be redeeming at any point.&nbsp; (It wasn't).<br /><br /><br /><br />8 November 2008<br />I Am Legend<br />Francis Lawrence, USA, 2007<br />Location: kitchen<br />Format: DivX on laptop screen<br />Company: Tara, partially<br />The first half of this film actually surprised me, as I didn't expect it to be so dark.&nbsp; I was busy making aloo paratha while it was on so I didn't watch very closely, and I didn't notice the CGI being that bad since it was on a laptop screen&nbsp; and it didn't have my full attention.&nbsp; I didnt realise this was an Omega Man remake, and I've never seen the original, but I would have to give this some props for being surprisingly edgy and dark (at least for a Will Smith movie).&nbsp; But by the end I was bored, and the resolution was so cheesy and overdone (with the voiceover) that I felt disappointed.&nbsp; The final zombie siege of the house was way too CGI for me.&nbsp; I like my zombies slow (I know they aren't technically zombies, but whatever) and non-computer generated.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />14 November 2008<br />Casino Royale<br />Martin Campbell, USA / UK / Germany / Czech Republic, 2006<br />Location: bedroom / flat area<br />Format: DivX served via laptop, projected on wall<br />Company: none<br /><p>In high school Brian and I loved Bond films, and I maintained an active interest in them until I reached the age where I could not defend their shittyness to myself any longer.&nbsp; So I haven't seen the last few - but advertisements for the new one have made me curious, proving that advertising works on me despite my best attempts to resist it.&nbsp; I figured this was at least worth the cost of downloading and it would make a good film to relax to, especially as I'm planning to sit through 7 hours of <em>Star Spangled to Death </em>tomorrow.&nbsp; </p><p>This was definitely the best Bond film since <em>The Living Daylights</em>, though that isn't saying much.&nbsp; The producers deliberately tried to make a film in line with the &quot;edgier&quot;, somewhat more minimalist films of this era, and they succeeded in updating the Bond origin story to a very contemporary setting.&nbsp; That's not to say that this isn't still a ridiculous action film, but at least they were a bit more sensitive of complex political climates than previous entries in the series.&nbsp; Amongst the gratuitous action sequences, contrived plot devices, and non-stop Sony product placement were a few faint traces of a <em>spy</em> film - something I don't think has really been in a Bond film since <em>From Russia With Love</em>.&nbsp; Of course my same criticism of the Batman film is here - TOO DAMN LONG - and I get bored watching people play cards on screen.&nbsp; Still, it's amazing that they held back on the catchphrases, quips and gadgets - though I suspect that will all come in the new film.&nbsp; I would rank this in the upper half of Bond films though, behind <em>FRWL, Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Thunderball, Dr. No</em> ... okay, I'd probably put this about equal with <em>For Your Eyes Only </em>or <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>, and maybe a hair's breath above <em>The Living Daylights</em>.&nbsp; And a handful better than <em>Diamonds are Forever</em>.&nbsp; I could play this game all night but I'm going to go to bed now. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 November 2008<br />Star Spangled to Death<br />Ken Jacobs, USA, 2004<br />Location: Kiasma gallery<br />Format: DivX, projected in theater<br />Company: Various intermittent museumgoers, Sarah Alden for final hour<br /><p>I'm drawn to long, epic works (<em>Infinite Jest, Gravity's Rainbow, </em>etc.) but I always worry that I might value these works just for their size.&nbsp; It's true that I like ambitious, messy projects but usually because the messyness triggers lots of ideas in my mind, rather than for the sake of mess itself.&nbsp; <em>Star Spangled to Death</em> is something I've wanted to watch ever since Brian Baxter raved about it to me, maybe two years ago, but I've never actually sat down and watched it (despite downloading a copy not too long ago) - I knew that I wouldn't have the attention span or the patience. When I saw it was playing every day this month in Kiasma, I decided to attempt it in one sitting, knowing that watching it in public would be easier than a home viewing.</p><p><em>Star Spangled to Death</em>, at 402 minutes, is the longest film I have ever seen.&nbsp; There was not a single point at which I was bored or wanted it to be over.&nbsp; I would hesistate to recommend it to everyone due to its extremely uncommercial nature, but fans of experimental film MUST see this.&nbsp; As a filmed essay about America, it is unequaled in its depth.&nbsp; It consists probably 75% of found footage, but the found footage is mostly used in its entirety, which gives more of a scope to it than the cleverly edited Adam Curtis-style of pastiche.&nbsp; Though there's some manipulation of this material, it's minimal, and usually it's commented on by text overlays, many only on screen for a few frames (making this a work that is conceived entirely for DVD).</p><p>The originally filmed material is mostly Jack Smith and Jerry Sims vamping around their NYC apartment courtyard, with a few 'location' shots, such as Jack (as The Spirit Not of Life but of Living) &quot;freeing slaves&quot; in a staged demonstration.&nbsp; Though plotless and shot without sync sound, there's such a spirit of anarchy and mirth that it makes the 6 hours fly by almost quickly.&nbsp; There are a few sections that are absolutely, completely mindblowing from an artistic point of view - specifically the soundtrack right after the Richard Nixon 'Checkers' speech (which is included in all 30 minutes of its glory, more ridiculous and horrible than any parody ever could be).&nbsp; Actually this film is kind of like a 400 minute version of 'Bleu Shut', except topical - about racism, imperialism, sexual commodification, class struggle, economics, psychology - and still as absurd as 'Bleu Shut'. </p><p>I can feel the rage that Ken Jacbos felt in 2004, rage at the Bush administration and the Iraq War, that made him go back and finish this 47-year old project.&nbsp; The 2004 material is integrated well into the film, and apart from the video section of anti-Iraq war protesters at the end, it doesn't feel like anything was really tacked-on.&nbsp; And just because we elected Barack Obama, i'm not ready to say that America has changed yet - but watching this film right now was a curious time, as I feel the same optimism that Jack Smith represents (after a lifetime of Suffering like Jerry). &nbsp; </p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 November 2008<br />Scaphandre et le papillon, Le<br />Julian Schnabel, France / USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Bil Boichel was raving about this so I gave it a spin, and I too was dazzled at the construction of this wonderful film.&nbsp; There's a stunning visual element here - besides the camera placement, there's actually some fantastic digital effects here, done to create a sense of surrealism and emphasise the theme of being &quot;locked in&quot;.&nbsp; But the narrative was compelling to the point of creating a total obsession while I was watching.&nbsp; It's optimisitic and &quot;life-affirming&quot; (a phrase I always hate in film reviews) but manages to pack a lot of pain into its running time as well.&nbsp; The explorations of family life and marital infidelity are viewed through such a fucked up lens (no pun intended) that it should be idiosyncratic, but somehow it feels universal.&nbsp; The film coulda have played with the viewer's sympathies more, but instead of playing that game it just blasts straight forward with a full-on emotional punch.&nbsp; A masterpiece, for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 November 2008<br />Standard Operating Procedure<br />Errol Morris, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom / flat area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Eroll Morris takes on the Abu Ghraib torturings with his usual heavily stylised approach.&nbsp; No film can ever truly capture the disgustingness of these activities, but this one is good because it doesn't try to frame a larger argument about the war, instead focusing on the issue of accountability and the documentary nature of the evidence.&nbsp; Actually, I think this is most interesting when it's looking at the photographs and their &quot;meaning&quot; - in that sense, this becomes more about the idea of evidence than the torture itself.&nbsp; I guess that's in line with other films he's made too, like <em>The Thin Blue Line</em> and <em>Mr. Death</em>; they also explore the uncertainity of an event and the idea of &quot;proof&quot;, which is an interesting wedge to drive into a publically discussed controversy.&nbsp; I started to think about how I'm always interested in being confronted with the mundane, and I started to think about how this same approach might have worked when applied to something much less serious than Abu Ghraib.&nbsp; I did get a little bored at times but I have also seen <em>Taxi to the Dark Side</em>, and let's be honest - this stuff is a major bummer.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 November 2008<br />Picture of Light<br />Peter Mettler, Canada / Switzerland, 1994<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is an earlier film by the guy who made the stunning <em>Gambling, Gods and LSD</em> (which I never actually finished watching), recommended by Brian Miles.&nbsp; This was a perfect film to watch during a snowstorm; I huddled under the covers and stared at the stunning yet somewhat &quot;lo-fi&quot; images while imagining the cold northern world outside.&nbsp; For a film that is simple - just some photographs of the Northern Lights - it is as much a Picture of North as it is a Picture of Light.&nbsp; The lifestyle of Chuchhill, Manitoba unfolds as the stark, element-battling reality that it is, though Mettler is never exploitative or cheap.&nbsp; The narration is dry, but kind of perfect, poetic without being flamboyant.&nbsp; The brilliance of the magnetic effects seemed unreal, and due to the DivX encoding they are occasionaly pixelated, but it actually seemed to work well as the low-budget production does a lot visually with obviously limited resources.&nbsp; I think another thing that made this so great was that it was simple - this was a film that could have been made by me or my friends, and it's unassuming nature made it feel warm and almost familiar.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 December 2008<br />The Spy Who Came in from the Cold<br />Martin Ritt, UK, 1965<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Anthony's serial Bond-watching has made me nostalgic ; I've been craving some good ol' British spy films but I've lacked the time to watch them lately.&nbsp; I was able to steal 2 hours tonight and check this out, and I was delighted.&nbsp; I much prefer films that are actually about espionage rather than car chases and stunts; give me the paper-pushing bureaucrats instead of the thrilling suave sex magnets.&nbsp; I mean, <em>The Wire </em>taught me that the real drama lies in the system, not the glamour; this film contained not even a hint of action so it was perfect in that.&nbsp; Richard Burton totally kicks ass and the plot never shows its full deck.&nbsp; It's got the perfect cold war vibe and I would definitely watch it again, in fact, this is probably the best spy film I've ever seen.&nbsp; I should watch all the other Le Carr&eacute; adaptations to mirror Anthony's Bond-watching, or maybe sit through the Harry Palmer series again (well, at least the first two).<br /><br /><br /><br />5 December 2008<br />The Visitor<br />Thomas McCarthy, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />I never saw <em>The Station Agent</em> but I thought this was the same Tom McCarthy who wrote <em>Remainder</em> - though it was actually an American, who played Templeton in season 5 of <em>The Wire</em>.&nbsp; But anyway, I thought this would be a good film to watch at 3 AM and I found myself enjoying it throughout because it's impeccably photographed and generally 'easy' to watch.&nbsp; The film is almost too easy - the story was a bit too sappy and plain for me to really engage with, but Richard Jenkins was so carefully played that I stayed with it.&nbsp; I wouldn't say I was blown away or anything but I am perhaps a bit curious to watch <em>The Station Agent</em> now.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />8 December 2008<br />The Constant Gardener<br />Fernando Meirelles, UK / Germany, 2005<br />Location: bedroom / tv nook<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Here's some more Le Carr&eacute;, though this is a edgy political thriller rather than a spy film. Still, conspiracy and paranoia reigns supreme, and I was left a bit blown away by this.&nbsp; I remembered reading good reviews of it when I first moved to the UK, but this went far beyond what I expected.&nbsp; As these thriller films go, it's second to none - and recasts those Tom Clancy movies in an inferior way.&nbsp; This is a very stylised film, looking distinct and artistic throughout but maybe almost in a way that is generic - because these techniques (weird, handheld camera angles, washed out color, strange edits) have become almost the &quot;default&quot; cinematic language of the middle of this decade.&nbsp; However, it makes this a far more interesting film than one that would have come out of Hollywood.&nbsp; Some of the African scenes are breathtaking, and the narrative was realistic and engaging enough (and dealing with corporate evil, which is always a topic I can get behind) that I actually didn't want this to end.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2008<br />Wanted<br />Timur Bekmambetov, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Wanted</em> is the type of film that makes me feel like a conservative Christian middle-American parent who is disgusted by Hollywood&rsquo;s immoral glorification of violence.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the same person who loved <em>Ichi the Killer</em> because of the way it elevated violence to a sort of beauty while studying it&rsquo;s delirious effects; <em>Wanted</em> contained not a grain of intelligence, merely portraying a sickeningly vacuous male fantasy.&nbsp; Of course this is perfect for a film that takes the plot of a comic book and expands it into a 2-hour cinematic package: origin, training, etc.&nbsp; But this film more frequently resembles a video game (like so many other Hollywood CGI feasts these days) through it&rsquo;s kinetic visuals and the obligatory final assault (involving the entrance to the castle, lower level minions on the ground floor, and a slow buildup to the &lsquo;boss&rsquo; stage [only to find that the princess is in another castle]).&nbsp; And while a film like <em>The Matrix </em>(the first one) uses digital-driven time effects to propel the viewer into a fantasy world that questions the simulacra of every day life, <em>Wanted</em> seems to miss that step - leaving all flash and no brains.</p><p>The paradox of this film is that it is so incredibly fast - the action sequences are visually dazzling even to a cynic, and the plot wastes no time on character development, even using hot editing and off-kilter digital effects on the non-action portions of the film - yet incredibly slow, feeling about one reel too long. And the action sequences are of course retreads of the slow-motion effects popularised in <em>The Matrix</em> and the bullet&rsquo;s eye view thing we saw back in the 80s with <em>Evil Dead</em> - a fast/slow dichotomy that works to exhilarating effect when done well, but starts to feel like repetitive here. </p><p>The originality, if there is any, lies in the way the Russian director has cast off any attempt at substance and just goes for the entertainment jugular (and I have seen some Russian music videos online that feel like companions to this movie).&nbsp; I am a great fan of violent films, speaking as a pacifist here, both cartoonish (as in <em>Ichi</em>, or <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>) and visceral (I always refer to <em>Straw Dogs</em> as an example of this because there is nothing better).&nbsp; This film falls between, in a mediocre middle ground.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing but a celebration of American gun culture, conveniently and completely removing society and the state from its equation.&nbsp; Even as a non-stop onslaught of explosions, bullets, and blood, it plays it safe - the graphic gore is so computer generated that it feels safe and distant, a series of pixels rather than any voice of actual pain.&nbsp; This lack of depth in the violence of course exemplifies the entire film; I watched it as a jaded, glossy-eyed victim, smiling through the choreographed murders and wondering how long it will be until films like this are overlaid with text/visual overlays - health status bars, captions, embedded video, etc. Greenaway of course was doing this back in <em>Prospero&rsquo;s Books</em> but why not make the action film closer to a website than the conventional, &ldquo;untainted&rdquo; film frame?&nbsp; The open sky of Jim and Derrick will be upon us soon enough.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2008<br />The Rundown<br />Peter Berg, USA, 2003<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />The intolereable glamorous violence of <em>Wanted</em> left me hungry for a more satisfying sort of action/adventure movie, so I downloaded this after remembering that Doug Mosurak really liked it back in 2003.&nbsp; This was a much more family-friendly film though it was almost as violent; the violence was the PG-13/<em>Red Dawn</em> bloodless type and the action sequences, while every bit as choreographed as in <em>Wanted</em>, were significantly more traditional in their filming techniques.&nbsp; There were still a lot of things that left me cold here; The Rock is supposed to be a heroic protagonist who renounces guns - a wholesome ass-kicker I guess - but all that goes out the window when he just starts killing dudes at the end.&nbsp; The sidekick kid was pretty annoying and even Christopher Walken just felt like a limp parody of himself.&nbsp; Still, this was a far better adventure film than the last Indiana Jones (even if the actual treasure hunting was kept to about 5-10 minutes of this) and probably better than <em>Romancing the Stone</em> too. <br /><br /><br /><br />10 December 2008<br />Shoot 'Em Up<br />Michael Davis, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />With this, I believe (and hope) that my trilogy of action movies is complete.&nbsp; I didn't even want to watch this, but I figured I should finish what I started (when I impulsively decided to download and watch 3 action movies in a row).&nbsp; This is a film that may be even more morally repellant than <em>Wanted</em>.&nbsp; While that film at least was just about bending bullets and other ridiculous stuff like that, this was an absolute worship of the gun than made me sick with it's weak &quot;gun control&quot; message.&nbsp; The action sequences in <em>Shoot Em Up </em>are similarly exaggerated and the treatment of women is probably even more misogynistic; at least <em>Wanted </em>had a more goofball feel to it.&nbsp; This is just gross and violent.&nbsp; What makes (some) ultra-violent Japanese movies good is that there is such a deep respect for human life in them - this is carried through in the violence itself, and thus the deaths have more impact.&nbsp; In <em>Shoot Em Up</em>, hundreds of nameless, faceless people are murdered without a thought given to it; the protagonist is responsible for most, if not all, and his killing is no less horrible than the bad guy's.&nbsp; I know it's stupid for me to get so outraged at this - after all, I believe that violent movies and video games provide a release to a lot of people, and I did sit down wanting to watch something bloody and action-packed - but I think violence can be done well, which is isn't here.&nbsp; I guess it's like pornography - the sexualised image can be an amazing thing, but in pornography it's reduced to a gross approximation of eroticism.&nbsp; It's not hard to argue that this film is pornography through its sexualising of the gun barrel (the obvious phallic comparator of course) and this actually elevates it to fantasy/sci-fi levels (such as shooting the merry-go-round to make it spin, the same type of crap in <em>Wanted</em> with the bullets hitting each other, etc.).&nbsp; I do realise now that Paul Giamatti isn't actually a very good actor - I am just so enamoured by <em>Safe Men</em> that I enjoyed any film where he plays a schmucky character.&nbsp; Seeing him cast as an alpha male is just annoying.&nbsp; Also, isn't Monica Bellucci supposed to be a sex object or something?&nbsp; She just looked like a weird old mannequin here.&nbsp; Now that this gauntlet of bullets is finished I'm going to detox by watching something fey and/or intellectual ....<br /><br /><br /><br />11 December 2008<br />Henry Fool<br />Hal Hartley, USA, 1997<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Revisiting <em>Henry Fool</em> after YEARS - I mean, the first time I saw it pre-dates PBT, if you can believe that - was weird, but enjoyable.&nbsp; Because this was the first Hal Hartley film I ever saw, I think I remembered it as a massive, huge epic.&nbsp; I'm not sure why I remember this - I mean, it's perhaps a bit larger in scope than Hartley's other work (at least his early stuff) but the production sensibilities fit in alongside of <em>Trust </em>and <em>The Unbelievable Truth</em> and all those films.&nbsp; That sensibility - which probably appealed to my overwrought teenage self somewhat - is hard to fathom now.&nbsp; The wooden acting and weird stage directions sometimes makes me feel like I'm watching a mediocre play, but that is what Hartley does, I guess. I'm glad he doesn't attempty to deny the artifice of film, even if he isn't doing much with the art form besides putting a play on celluloid.&nbsp; I really enjoyed this film though- I'm not sure if it's the allegorical nature of it, or the fact that it's actually a very simple tale of friendship seen through the creative practice. The acting is weird and wooden and I think what I took from this as my favorite thing is the same thing I love about <em>Simple Men</em> - this weirdo community of characters Hartley creates in Queens, just like the Long Island of <em>Simple Men</em>.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />12 December 2008<br />Fay Grim<br />Hal Hartley, USA / Germany, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Andy got us this as a wedding gift, I guess, but I never watched it as I wanted to sit through <em>Henry Fool</em> again.&nbsp; Well in back-to-back sittings I've had just about enough of Hal Hartley for along time.&nbsp; I like the idea of a sequel to an arthouse film, and even more I like the idea of making it almost a decade later but getting the completely original cast to return, even down to the original kid who played the son.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Hartley decided to pursue his spy film/noir obsessions and completely abandon the vibe of the first film.&nbsp; Instead of going through the tribulations of these totally fucked-up characters, he makes it into a cheesy cat and mouse game that reminds me of all of his worst films (<em>Amateur</em>, <em>No Such Thing</em>).&nbsp; Jeff Goldblum doesn't even seem interested, and Hartley sticks random titles over the screen, probably as yet another Godard tribute but they just make the film feel even messier.&nbsp; There's a few weak political statements made about terrorism and globalisation and war, maybe, or maybe they're just plot devices he lifted from his influences. The one saving grace is the kid who plays Johnny on <em>The Wire</em>.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />12 December 2008<br />Twin Falls Idaho<br />Michael Polish, USA, 1999<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />I'd been meaning to check out some other work by the Polish brothers after <em>Northfork</em>.&nbsp; This was their first film, starring them, and the Siamese-twin theme is certainly ripe for exploitation or easy sentimentality but they avoid both.&nbsp; The film had a really distinct look, like a present day that was already antiquated - and had very calm pacing, as they let the film breathe and tell its own story.&nbsp; The magical realism is definitely held back here but it's still an auspicious debut.&nbsp; Maybe I'm being kind to it, but after <em>Northfork </em>these guys have a giant blank cheque with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm curious to check out their other films now; hopefully it won't take me years like it took me to get around to watching this.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 December 2008<br />Quantum of Solace<br />Marc Forster, UK / USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><em>Casino Royale</em> was good (at least for a James Bond film), but there's no way they could keep it going, right?&nbsp; The very nature of factory filmmaking will demand that this film falls into the formula: quips, gadgets, the sacrificial lamb, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong - this was not only great, it was better than <em>Casino Royale</em>, and objectively speaking it may actually be the &quot;best&quot; James Bond film ever.&nbsp; I say it is the best objectively, in that it's the most intelligent, the most tasteful, and the most &quot;realistic&quot;, at least in the way it's a bit restrained.&nbsp; Of course I subjectively love the 60's Bond films because of the aesthetics of the time; they are a relic of a different era and these are just continuations of the characters and narrative in a contemporary mileu.&nbsp; It actually feels like the public are demanding more intelligent entertainment; this is really almost shockingly great for a Bond film. Of course it starts with a car chase, then has the naked lady credits, then has a chase on foot, a boat chase and a plane chase before the first half is even over.&nbsp; Yet Bond goes at it without gadgets, without banging the main Bond girl, and without even ending up with a girl at the end.&nbsp; After having just watched <em>The Constant Gardener</em>, I see a lot of similarities in their construction - these &quot;political thriller&quot; have a distinctly British flavor, which is nice after 20 Americanised Bond films.&nbsp; The violence is brutal here and the action scene during the Opera performance is an unusual arthouse gesture for these films; again I was impressed, as yet another shooting/chase scene would have been boring so they did it well.&nbsp; I'm sorry I doubted this; but I am curious how they are going to top it, because they've stretched the formula as far as they can.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 December 2008<br />Frost/Nixon<br />Ron Howard, USA / UK / France, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><em>&ldquo;<em>Let us sit</em> upon the <em>ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.&quot;&nbsp; </em></em>Ron Howard gives us another chapter in the succession of films about American presidents and Nixon in particular, this time making a big production out of the David Frost interview.&nbsp; This employs a great deal of dramatic license and manages to create two hours of entertainment, despite being a film about the making of an interview.&nbsp; My biggest beef is the two actors who played the titular characters; both seemed to be striving for empathy yet reduced the roles to caricatures.&nbsp; The Nixon had the voice and facial expressions spot on, but almost seemed to be portraying our idea of Nixon rather than Nxon himself.&nbsp; i didn't expect Philip Baker Hall's performance from <em>Secret Honor</em>, but this felt too simple, too easy.&nbsp; And while I enjoyed this film enough - I was entertained throughout - I sort of wished I was seeing the actual interviews rather than a dramatic reconstruction of them.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />15 December 2008<br />Milk<br />Gus Van Sant, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is probably the best Gus Van Sant film I've ever seen, and comes at a particularly poignant time (with California just passing Proposition 8).&nbsp; The film unambiguously paints Milk as a hero, which is fair enough - but never loses sight of Milk's own belief that the movement is stronger than any one person.&nbsp; Though this had its dramatic flourishes, I did find it quite moving, though thinking about the result last month in California is a crushing, bitter aftertaste.&nbsp; The Milk/Moscone murders are something I've always wanted to know more about, so this was great for that reason too.&nbsp; I've heard the &quot;Dan White was a repressed homosexual&quot; theory before, and it's cool that Van Sant gives it a mention in the film; I suppose it's probably good that he didn't push that too hard.&nbsp; I expected this film to have a more anti-police flavor too, since I always thought the police made a hero out of White, but that's also kept to a minimum.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />16 December 2008<br />Americathon<br />Neal Israel, USA / West Germany, 1979<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />The last two films I watched seemed fairly relevant towards the current political situation in the US; <em>Frost/Nixon</em> was concerned with a disgraced president's legacy, and <em>Milk</em> dealt with the issue of gay rights in California.&nbsp; Here's a film about a huge financial crisis in America where an idiot president (played by John Ritter) has to fix things.&nbsp; The solution is to hold a big telethon, which provides an excuse to trot out bizarre, mediocre performers in a strange Gong Show parody.&nbsp; The cast list on IMDB makes this film sound amazing; it's definitely fucked up, but in that terrible &quot;Forgotten Yuk&quot; way, with the humour unsuccessful and aimed towards kids anyway.&nbsp; This is the kind of movie a 14 year old would write, actually.&nbsp; The clip of Jay Leno getting beaten up by an old lady in a boxing ring is mildly entertaining, and Meat Loaf is a lot smaller in 1979 than he was in <em>Fight Club</em>.&nbsp; Ho-hum; I stopped paying attention pretty quickly and before I knew it, it was over.&nbsp; I think <em>Network</em> did a better job at satirising TV.<br /><br /><br /><br />19 December 2008<br />The Astronaut Farmer<br />Michael Polish, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom/kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Continuing with the Polish Brothers, this most recent feature film of theirs is a mild, family-friendly fantasy starring Billy Bob Thornton.&nbsp; It's good, but good in a family film way; I don't think I would have sat through this if I wasn't interested in the director.&nbsp; Their interest in dreams and landscape continues here - the whole film has that same aesthetic as in their other work - and this is one of the reasons I didn't get bored and turn it off.&nbsp; If I had kids, this would certainly be a good film to show them, if kids could handle a slow-paced film like this.&nbsp; <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2008<br />Mr. Mike's Mondo Video<br />Michael O'Donoghue, USA, 1979<br />Location: bedroom/kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />A parody of the &quot;Mondo&quot; series of videos, this is the brainchild of Michael O'Donoghue, whom I've always thought of as the Del Close of Saturday Night Live.&nbsp; His writing was supposed to be the edgy, fucked-up stuff that made the early seasons so great.&nbsp; However, this series of sketches is pretty limp.&nbsp; It starts with a guy throwing cats into a swimming pool, and the rest of the film continues with a series of sketches based on a one-joke premise, which is the type of humour that I thought only plagued recent Saturday Night Live years.&nbsp; Actually, I'm afraid to re-visit the early SNLs for fear that they will be crap too.&nbsp; There's some weird moments in here for sure, but in general it was too weak to elicit any sort of laughter from me.&nbsp; It's kinda cool to parody a style of film that is obscure to begin with - and it reminds me that I've never actually seen <em>Mondo Cane</em> - but the humour is so far from subversive that I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2008<br />Monde sans soleil, Le<br />Jacques-Yves Cousteau, France / Italy / USA, 1964<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Cousteau films are awesome.&nbsp; I loved seeing the giant shark 1000 feet deep in the ocean, and the shellfish scooting about trying to evade the starfish.&nbsp; The two French dudes who were adapting to life underwater were pretty cool.&nbsp; I should watch more of these because they are visually amazing.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 December 2008<br />RFK Must Die: The Assassination of Bobby Kennedy<br />Shane O'Sullivan, UK, 2007<br />Location: kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />I watched this while cleaning and organising the kitchen, and I really enjoyed it.&nbsp; It's a low-budget documentary looking at the disputed evidence in the RFK assassination, and proffers a theory that the CIA was somehow behind it.&nbsp; The Irish filmmaker keeps things grounded, though there's a few times he leans on witnesses - but he doesn't claim to be sure, just to offer some new findings.&nbsp; He thinks he's identified 3 CIA operatives who were present at the Ambassador Hotel that night, and interviews people who knew them, attempting to verify their identities.&nbsp; Of course, he cannot for sure - but that's the nebulous web of conspiracy theory.&nbsp; I love the general vibe of these conspiracy theories, with shadowy spooks occasionally accidentally photographed in different places and times, but never clearly identified. And it's also cool to see someone focusing on this assassination instead of the overhyped JFK one.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 December 2008<br />The Fall<br />Tarsem Singh, India / UK / USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Tarsem Singh, who made the <em>Losing My Religion</em> video, made this huge epic fairytale fantasy.&nbsp; It's like a darker version of <em>The Princess Bride </em>with metafictional elements, and it's totally visually stunning and entertaining without being clich&eacute;d.&nbsp; I particularly enjoyed the scenes shot in Udaipur and Jaipur, which were perfect for the epic tale he was trying to weave.&nbsp; As this is the second film this week I've seen that could be seen by children, I feel a bit creepy.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 December 2008<br />Calvaire<br />Fabrice Du Welz, Belgium / France / Luxembourg, 2004<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Andrew Radford lent me this on DVD a few years ago, but something was wrong with the DVD and I couldn't watch it or copy it.&nbsp; I forgot about it til I saw it on the WFMU blog, where someone made a list of the top 10 horror films they had seen in 2008.&nbsp; This is a creepy Belgian version of <em>Deliverance</em>, though I've never seen <em>Deliverance</em> so I'm just basing that on what cultural literacy has told me about that film.&nbsp; Its shot on film in a hazy, distant way, and the lead actor is just unpleasant enough to make you relish what happens to him.&nbsp; There's some moments of real brutality - the type of violence that chills you to the marrow without being explicit.&nbsp; The filmmaker really makes rural Wallonia seem like a desolate, terrifying place - practically something out of Lord of the Rings. Plus, there's a cameo by an Brigitte Lahaie. <br /><br /><br /><br />23 December 2008<br />Naboer<br />P&#229;l Sletaune, Denmark / Sweden / Norway, 2005<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is another horror film I grabbed after seeing it on a top 10 list, and even though it was after 4 AM I decided to watch it anyway (since it's only 71 minutes).&nbsp; I found a dark, psycho-sexual horror film that relied upon awkwardness and sexual tension for most of its first half.&nbsp; When it finally explodes through what is probably the most disturbing (and best) sex scene I've ever seen, it takes on a much more phantasmagoric nature that genuinely explores violence and sexuality in a more much serious manner than I've ever seen in a film before. (Sorry, <em>Ichi the Killer</em>.)&nbsp; The depiction of interior space borrows the idea from <em>House of Leaves</em> - it's disorientating, impossible to get a spatial sense, much like <em>Suspiria</em>.&nbsp; There are some truly arousing moments, but then i felt horrible and ashamed for enjoying such depravity.&nbsp; It's brilliant film psychology, and luckily Sletaune doesn't overstay his welcome. Being set in sterile, Scandinavian interiors makes it even creepier.&nbsp; This was a very serious, chilling film that I'll proably never watch again.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 December 2008<br />Ex Drummer<br />Koen Mortier, Belgium, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is one of the blackest comedies I've ever seen.&nbsp; Come to think of it, every Belgian film I've ever seen has been extremely fucked up.&nbsp; This was funny though - if you find handicapped people, rape, genital mutilation, drug addiction, and violence hilarious.&nbsp; As a portrayal of the most hopeless aspects of society, it lacks nuance; as an extremely cynical blast of twisted humour, I think it really, really worked.&nbsp; The best kinds of dark comedy make you ashamed for laughing and this was truly extreme.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2008<br />Bottle Rocket<br />Wes Anderson, USA, 1996<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara for half, but she fell asleep<br />The best film of the 90's.&nbsp; One of the best films ever.&nbsp; It's actually been awhile since i watched it, so I relished every moment.&nbsp; Loved looking for details that amused me, like Dignan's watch or Mr. Henry's assistant being named Rowboat (how did I never notice that before??).&nbsp; I want Wes Anderson films to be my Christmas tradition, even if Tara is resistant.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 December 2008<br />Tank Girl<br />Rachel Talalay, USA, 1995<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br />Tara's actually seen this twice before and I cant imagine why she wanted to sit through it again. I remember before this came out how there was talk of Lori Petty being the next big star, like an A-list movie actress, but I guess <em>Tank Girl</em> killed any chance of that.&nbsp; This is like the most &quot;90's&quot; movie ever.&nbsp; Lori Petty is so annoying but Naomi Watts is nerdy and cute so it makes up for it, almost.&nbsp; Ice-T as the angry, horny kangaroo-man was amusing but I liked the Anthony Braxton-like kangaroo leader more.&nbsp; This was pretty painful to get through, which is why it helped to view it in two sittings.&nbsp; I bet Daron loves this movie.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 December 2008<br />Ernest Goes to Africa<br />John R. Cherry III, USA, 1997<br />Location: bedroom/kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br />I expect this to be bad, but thought it might be fun to see a direct-to-video Ernest movie and see how it was.&nbsp; It wasn't just bad, it was actually depressing because I actually think <em>Goes to Camp</em> and <em>Goes to Jail</em> are pretty decent (or at least I have fond memories of them).&nbsp; The difference, in terms of production values, between those earlier Ernest adventure and this one is astounding.&nbsp; How far can a children's entertainer fall in just a few short years?&nbsp; I thought this was the last Ernest film but Wikipedia tells me that there's also <em>Ernest in the Army </em>and an unfinished <em>Ernest the Pirate</em> to come later.&nbsp; How great would the <em>Pirate </em>footage be for a special edition bonus feature on a DVD set of <em>Ernest: The later years</em>?&nbsp; Anyway. this was amazingly filmed on location in Johannesburg, South Africa, or at least they say so; there's no reason to think this wasn't just filmed on somebody's farm in Ohio, since there is nothing remotely convincing about the footage apart from the one animal scene where you see Ernest in the same frame as an elephant, which could have been shot in the Cincinnati Zoo.&nbsp; I thought Varney died of suicide but it was actually lung cancer; obviously he never actually watched the final edit of this, or he woulda offed himself 3 years sooner.&nbsp; Should I make the commitment to irony and also watch <em>Ernest in the Army </em>and <em>Slam Dunk Ernest</em>?&nbsp; Eventually, eventually.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 December 2008<br />Man on Wire<br />James Marsh, USA / UK, 2008<br />Location: bedroom/kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This documentary was worth the hype - you can't really go wrong with subject material as amazing as this.&nbsp; The wirewalker was fascinating - his self-imposed challenges were like something a character in <em>Life: A User's Manual</em> would do.&nbsp; The heavy use of reconstructions was kinda weird, but greatly aided in the storytelling; the film overall reminded me of an Erroll Morris documentary.&nbsp; Also, it was nice to hear some of my favorite tunes from <em>The Falls</em> in another context.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2009<br />Milk<br />Gus Van Sant, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara, Anna Crawford<br />Second time through and I still really enjoyed this, though I don't think I'll ever give it a third watch - this was more for Tara and Anna's benefit.&nbsp; I like how Van Sant always used sepiatones for Dan White at home/church, to contrast with the wider palette for the gay activists.&nbsp; Cleve Jones is awesome too, and I noticed in the credits that the real one had a cameo in this.&nbsp; Still wanna see that 80's documentary about this stuff.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2009<br />My Winnipeg<br />Guy Maddin, Canada, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Anna Crawford<br />Guy Maddin's love/hate poem to his hometown is an incredible and sometimes hilarious personal documentary that uses his unique visual style to make something truly exceptional.&nbsp; This reminded me of a bizarro Jonathan Meades at times, though it took me awhile to realise he was just making things up.&nbsp; Everything comes together in this - the images, the narration, and the really strong script - and I absolutely loved it.&nbsp; It made me homesick for my own city, even though it's not Winnipeg.&nbsp; Compared to the other Maddin films I've seen, this is a departure though it retains that Guy Maddin feel; I'm curious now to see more of his work.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 January 2009<br />I'm Not There.<br />Todd Haynes, USA / Germany, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Anna Crawford<br />I watched this really late and was struggling to stay awake, so I probably slept through about four minutes of this film without meaning to.&nbsp; it was awesome though, and I'd possibly watch it again to get a better feel for it.&nbsp; The gamble of this film pays off well - all of the actors are strong and I particulalry liked Richard Gere's mythical Billy the Kid Dylan, especially the scene where he sees the band (Band?) playing 'Going to Acapulco'.&nbsp; Blanchett finally impresses me with her <em>Don't Look Back</em> cover version.&nbsp; Recreating all of these mythical events in the Dylan story was certainly fun and it's made me realise how much I know about the man even though I'm not a huge fan.&nbsp; The cleverness of this film never got in the way of my enjoyent (which I was worried about); and it really experiments with the ideas of cultural figures, historical revisionism, and speculation without ever 'crossing the line'.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />16 January 2009<br />Hannah and Her Sisters<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1986<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This film hits like a baseball bat wrapped in feathers.&nbsp; In some ways this is a perfect Woody Allen film - it negotiates martial territory extremely well, yet also has the Woodman himself playing his usual role and serving up just enough comedy.&nbsp; The thing is, I probably wouldn't have appreciated this a few years ago (and I hate it when I realise things like that).&nbsp; I really liked how this dealt with an ensemble/family situation primarily, but then Woody Allen's character paralleled the group dynamic with this internal struggle, which (if a bit narratively simplistic) echoed the other narrative but not in an annoying or self-indulgent way.&nbsp; I'm really glad I decided to stay in tonight and take a break from coding PBT 3.0 and watch this. Definitely one of the best Woody Allen films I've seen.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 January 2009<br />Crimes and Misdemeanors<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1989<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>My second Woody Allen film of the night, and another very strong entry into the Woody Allen filmography.&nbsp; This had some slightly more 'arty' aspects than I'm used to from him - some moody cinematography, and the rabbi character who slowly descends into blindness to parallel the moral slides of the other characters. Like <em>Hannah and her Sisters</em>, there are two story lines that meet at the end, though it's not really as important that they meet in <em>Hannah</em>.&nbsp; It's interesting how it doesn't really matter if Allen is making a comedy or a drama, for all of his films have such a unique identifiable style and rhythm that they're really their own genre.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 January 2009<br />The Purple Rose of Cairo<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1985<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is a fairly well-regarded film and it's certainly a cute excursion into fantasy/escapism.&nbsp; I loved the way this looked, but I got bored with the idea pretty quickly.&nbsp; The story resolved in a fairly unhappy manner, which saved it a bit; there weren't any technical flaws or weak links in the way this was constructed, it was just a bit too simple for my tastes.&nbsp; Also it's hard for me to take Danny Aiello seriously after <em>Just Farr a Laugh</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br />23 January 2009<br />Pont du Nord, Le<br />Jacques Rivette, France, 1981<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's hard to know what to make of this film but I feel somewhat inspired.&nbsp; This is a very strange bit of surealistic theatre; the narrative is thin and occasionally awkward, but ultimately imaginative and strangely warm.&nbsp; Like <em>Celine et Julie</em>, this explores the link between "reality" and fiction through the method of game-playing.&nbsp; I love games in cinema and while this wasn't one I could play along with, I enjoyed the chase of it.&nbsp; But as the acting was oddly wooden, it teetered on the edge of being highly artificial even when supposedly being true.&nbsp; The crime plot seemed almost a parody of the edgy films that made Rivette's French new wave compatriots so famous: guns, shadowy men in trench coats, and secret maps, all strewn about the city of Paris.&nbsp; This film also explored a descent into madness, which I suspect is a common theme in Rivette's work, which I really must see more of. As Baptiste's oddness developed, the scenery of Paris slowly changed from the familiar traditional Paris to stark, concrete urbain - bleak architecture maybe suits the humans in this film better.&nbsp; Some of it reminded me of Rollin's <em>Night of the Hunted</em> (scenery-wise) but it is closest to <em>Celine et Julie</em> of any film I've ever seen.&nbsp; I have a stack of other Rivette films to dive into and I'm going to let myself be swept away by them; I get the feeling that this isn't even that good compared to his other work so I'm hoping to spend the next few weeks in a state of total amazement.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2009<br />Broadway Danny Rose<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1984<br />Location: bedroom / tv area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Another mid-80s Allen film that I enjoyed enough but it didn't knock it totally out of the park.&nbsp; I have become very impressed by Mia Farrow after watching all these, though maybe working with Woody is the secret to her success.&nbsp; Maybe Allen was consciously trying to blend comedy and drama more in these 80s films, but I don't think he really hit on it perfectly until <em>Hannah and Her Sisters</em>.&nbsp; Here I found myself wishing it would just be more balls-out slapstick like <em>Take the Money and Run</em>.&nbsp; This was quite well-made - I like how it captures a nostalgic 1940's feeling though it's actually set around 1970 - and it looked pretty great in b/w.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2009<br />Sho o suteyo machi e deyou<br />Shuji Terayama, Japan, 1971<br />Location: bedroom / kitchen / tv area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Peter Taylor begged me to see this when we hung out last week, and I'm glad he did.&nbsp; This is a totally psychedelic, extremely nihilistic Japanese experimental film that roughly follows a narrative structure yet has continual diversions keeping it exciting and adding to the anarchic feeling.&nbsp; There's some incredibly arresting imagery, and also some deeply human moments despite the rebellion.&nbsp; You can feel the rage throughout it but there's also a very careful attention to detail, such as when a man walks by carrying an animal carcass right after the sister is gang-raped by the soccer team.&nbsp; This is so much more than "a product of its time" though - and the Japanese psychedelic rock movement can probably claim this film as their <em>Tommy</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2009<br />Husbands and Wives<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1992<br />Location: bedroom / kitchen / tv area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The most serious Woody Allen film I have ever seen and because of the complete absence of humour, it carries a gravity that may influence my assessment.&nbsp; There's a lot of airing out of Farrow and Allen's martial problems here, and it shifts gears a bit more than his usual work - maybe accelerated by the fake documentary style?&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't been married as long as these characters but I can't help but feel that these supposed complexities of relationships, as presented in this film, are a bit too simple.&nbsp; Maybe I'm living in a dreamland, but it seems like these traps are easy to avoid through honesty and communication, which maybe is easier for someone of my generation to do.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Anyway, Sydney Pollack's fight with his young girlfriend is definitely the most brutal moment of any Woody Allen film ever (at least of the ones I've seen).&nbsp; Pretty good overall but I would only re-watch a Woody Allen film for laughs or for some incredibly profound resonant artistic moments, and this film had neither of those attributes.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2009<br />Brand Upon the Brain!<br />Guy Maddin, USA / Canada, 2006<br />Location: bedroom / kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Guy Maddin does it again - like <em>My Winnipeg</em> this is ostensibly about Guy Maddin returning to a scene of his childhood, except in this case it's competely fictional/fantastical.&nbsp; This film was made as a silent film and performed with a live improvised soundtrack; for the DVD release (which is what I was watching) they had a composed score and occasional narration by Isobel Rosellini, which helped anchor the narrative and didn't get in the way.&nbsp; The imagery is astounding as to be expected; the story is intriguing as well, combining macabre fantasy elements with a coming-of-age eroticism.&nbsp; I'm going to work back through his catalog now because I think I'm definitely a fan.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 February 2009<br />David Benoit Exposes Occultic Tendencies in Rock Music<br />David Benoit, USA, 1983<br />Location: kitchen area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>While I began paper-maiching the first of the two human-sized nose costumes I need to finish by next Friday, I put on this wacky Christian propaganda video I downoaded.&nbsp; It proved to be entertaining throughout it's entire 1 hour and 13 minutes, as brother Benoit instructed me that Satanism is real and not just in heavy metal music.&nbsp; I learned about how Duran and Duran and Stevie Nicks employ Satanic imagery in their album artwork to ensnare the youth of America in the army to commit human sacrifices.&nbsp; Mr. Benoit includes stories from his own troubled youth, and talks about the great brotherhood of Christ.&nbsp; The production was very straightforward, with Benoit talking in front of an emotionless audience, mostly with closeups of his face but occasionally breaking to cutaway shots illustrating the albums he talks about.&nbsp; Did you know that the Eagles wrote 'Hotel California' to celebrate the Church of Satan, and that it's Anton LaVey pictured in the album cover?&nbsp; Once I finish this occultist art project, I will renounce my wordly sins and embrace a life of Christ.&nbsp; Thanks, David Benoit!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 February 2009<br />Margot at the Wedding<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Baumbach follows up <em>The Squid and the Whale</em> with a punishingly depressing film that removes any traces of comedy and amps up the family dysfunction element, though within the boundaries of realism.&nbsp; This isn't the kind of film I'd watch over and over again for fun, but I was really into it.&nbsp; Stylistically he played it safe and just concentrated on challenging us with the characters and acting.&nbsp; Jack Black and Nicole Kidman are better than I've ever seen them, but Jennifer Jason Leigh really steals the show.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 February 2009<br />Before the Devil Knows You're Dead<br />Sidney Lumet, USA / UK, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Second Sunday movie for me and this is also bleak and dour, yet compelling enough to hold my interest throughout.&nbsp; This is like a typical Coen Bros film with the comedic/screwball elements removed; I kinda suspected the ending but it was still fun watching it play out.&nbsp; The zig-zag timeline worked in its favor without being a <em>Memento</em>esque gimmick.&nbsp; As good as this was, I can't imagine ever watching this again like I might with <em>The Usual Suspects</em> or similar works.&nbsp; It's weird to think this is the guy that made <em>Network</em> and <em>Dog Day Afternoon</em> - well, actually I see traces of the latter in this for sure.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 February 2009<br />Faces<br />John Cassavetes, USA, 1968<br />Location: Orion<br />Format: 35mm film w/Swedish subtitles,  in cinema<br />Company: Christer<br /><p>This is the first time I've seen a Cassavetes film in a cinema, and the big presentation drew attention to the low-budget origins of this film.&nbsp; It was grainy almost beyond belief, and the low lighting made it feel even moodier than when I saw this on Divx a few years back. God, what an insane and fucked-up film this is.&nbsp; It's pretty painful to sit through parts of this, as they are so intense you want to look away.&nbsp; I can't even imagine what it would be ilke to see this in 1968, as there had never really been anything like it before.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2009<br />Tropic Thunder<br />Ben Stiller, USA / Germany, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Hmmm.&nbsp; i laughed a bit at this, and thought the overall concept was pretty good, but something fell a bit flat. Maybe a case of too many stars ...?&nbsp; Or maybe I'm just being too hard on it.&nbsp; The fake actors and trailers were great and ridiculous (esp. 'Simple Jack') but also pretty easy; this film played it relatively by the book and I wish Steve Coogan had lasted a bit longer.&nbsp; Stiller's best work is still the old <em>Ben Stiller Show</em> where he was masterful at doing celebrity parodies that weren't necessarily the best impersonations but captured something great and kinda low-rent.&nbsp; In bigger budget settings I'm mostly disappointed but it's hard to trash a movie like this too much when it provides solid entertainment/laughs.&nbsp; I also watched the 'unrated director's cut' so maybe the theatrical version was better (usually they are shorter which means better 90% of the time).&nbsp; I did like when he killed the panda and the funny guy from <em>Pineapple Express</em> is always amusing.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 February 2009<br />Beavis and Butt-Head Do America<br />Mike Judge, Yvette Kaplan, USA, 1996<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara (sleeping)<br /><p>I had never seen the Beavis and Butthead movie before but I can't say that it's enriched my life in any way.&nbsp; I laughed a few times but it was generally formulaic and poorly animated.&nbsp; I do feel like I've unlocked another key to understanding Tara's sense of humour though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 February 2009<br />Getting Straight<br />Richard Rush, USA, 1970<br />Location: kitchen / TV area / bedroom<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><div>Lots of thoughts about this one.&nbsp; This has been my "holy grail" of Elliott Gould films, as it was made pretty much between <em>M*A*S*H</em> and <em>Little Murders</em> and therefore had to be amazing, right?&nbsp; I was surprised by a film that changed tones almost as manicdepressively as <em>Little Murders</em>, though without the extremely absurd worldview.&nbsp; I expected an exploitationish counterculture film, similar to <em>Greetings</em>, but instead found a film that tried be somewhat sophisticated.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I can pick up on the overall philosophy behind it; the ending seems a bit too much of a copout and I think that it would be almost disappointing given the earlier internal conflicts.&nbsp; I'll say this - there are some wretched moments in the script, and this would be a really forgettable waste of two hours if it didn't star Elliott Gould in 1970.&nbsp; But even he can't save some of the more "dramatic" monologues here, thought they are stirring (and dated). Murphy Brown is OK but nothing too amazing - it's interesting how both of the leads went on to make Jules Feiffer-penned films the following year.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I buy the explanation that Gould's dickish behavior towards Bergen is due to this innate desire to educate that makes him want to be a schoolteacher so much - that's a copout too, as I think it's much more interesting to make a film about changing social attitudes but illustrate how many people are unable to change their personal attitudes. (Not that that's a particularly original idea).&nbsp; I didn't realise this was directed by Richard Rush, who made <em>The Stunt Man</em>.&nbsp; I should try to organise my thoughts on this and write something longer somewhere.</div><br /><br /><br /><br />14 February 2009<br />Dillinger &#232; morto<br />Marco Ferreri, Italy, 1969<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I always mean to check out more Marco Ferreri stuff because I found 'Bye-Bye Monkey' deliciously surreal, and Adam and Lori used to rave about him.&nbsp; This relatively early film was a super weird whatthefuck, wonderfully set almost entirely in a man's house one evening.&nbsp; I loved how this was about process - the cleaning and painting of the gun, the cooking - all executed in a manner most routine yet careful.&nbsp; Piccoli's house, with all the modern convienences, reminded me a bit of something out of Tati, though in a much much darker way.&nbsp; The final scene is perfect, casting the whole film in a new light.&nbsp; That Piccoli's character is an industrial designer is great too, as Ferreri is very focused on design (in the careful aesthetic design of the film, plus the way all of the pieces fit together, both gun and narrative.&nbsp; This could be read a variety of ways, but I'm happy to just enjoy it for now and think about it a bit more on future viewings.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 February 2009<br />The Bourne Identity<br />Doug Liman, USA / Germany / Czech Republic, 2002<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Someone was talking about these movies lately so I thought it might be a fun, easy way to unwind on a Sunday night.&nbsp; So, an amnesia-laden mind-controlled killing machine runs around Europe hiding from the CIA, performing almost super-human feats of physical prowess and cunning while never commiting any acts of violence himself that might be morally outrageous to our sensibilities.&nbsp; I've seen it all before (though with less spectacular feats of strength) when it was Robert Redford in 'Three Days of the Condor', which I really loved; perhaps that film was better because it had a low-key 70's hero: a paper-pushing desk clerk who gets unwillingly drawn into the espionage game.&nbsp; Here, Bourne is pumped full of the speed required for a film of this decade - everything is so <em>extreme</em>, right? - though actually, this was pretty tasteful.&nbsp; Especially when compared to something like a James Bond film, Bourne comes off as (relatively) restrained, with the dial turned further in the direction of "SPY" than "ACTION".&nbsp; Which is the way I like it.&nbsp; I will never watch this again but I might as well watch the other two.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 February 2009<br />The Bourne Supremacy<br />Paul Greengrass, USA / Germany, 2004<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I expected this to be a prequel, but it wasn't.&nbsp; A similar plot here, slightly altered and geographically transposed to Berlin. After 4 straight hours of Matt Damon I'm getting tired; this one didn't have Chris Cooper to keep my interest.&nbsp; Though it's hard to really criticise this because it's not really very different than the first one. The action sequences are a bit more prevalent, I guess, and kinda weak too - the underwater scene in particular felt like I was watching a Sea World VHS. &nbsp; I'm committed to watch the third film of this trilogy now even though I don't want to.&nbsp; Maybe that one will be a prequel and it will feature Matt Damon as a ruthless killing machine who I can't empathise with, instead of a one-dimensional action hero who I can't empathise with.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 February 2009<br />The Bourne Ultimatum<br />Paul Greengrass, USA / Germany, 2007<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>There should be some sort of law against watching all three Bourne films in less than 24 hours.&nbsp; But i should finish what I started, right?&nbsp; I think the ultimate fantasy of these films is that the CIA is incredibly organised and competent, which history shows is far from the truth.&nbsp; For every car chase or fight scene, there are twice as many scenes of CIA agents in a dystopian control room, impossibly watching it unfold on hidden cameras and listening to anything they want with ridiculous surveillance equipment.&nbsp; I used to work with a guy who would hate a film if it wasn't completely plausible - I remember him trashing <em>Hot Fuzz</em> because there was an action sequence that he didn't think was realistic enough.&nbsp; I hope I don't sound like that; I actually didn't mind these films, and I have no claim to get these six hours of my life back.&nbsp; They were a bit bland, but thankfully they didn't resort to quips or humour in the slightest, and romantic impulses were played down.&nbsp; I will draw the line and refuse to watch the inevitable fourth film, though.&nbsp; This one was pretty much like the first two except it featured David Straithairn, who excels even in a thinly written baddie role.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 February 2009<br />Seme dell'uomo, Il<br />Marco Ferreri, France / Italy, 1969<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm glad I've started to watch the work of Marco Ferreri because I would have never otherwise come across this film. And actually, it's not a masterpiece or anything - there's some definitive unevenness to it, and I would probably say <em>Dillinger e morto</em> was a more complete artistic statement.&nbsp; But this is a weird, fucked up fantasy world that stands apart from all other apocalyptic films I've seen by the way it presents a paradise in the nightmare.&nbsp; The character's idyllic setting is so inviting that I wished I could have inhabited the film.&nbsp; There's also some incredibly surreal images - the giant Pepsi bottle in the sky, the whale on the beach and especially the mannequins under the plastic.&nbsp; These images, when juxtaposed with the beautiful Italian seascape, are more jarring and awe-inspiring than anything I've seen in a Jodorowsky film.&nbsp; Perhaps this is because Ferreri uses his images carefully and wisely rather than an all-out barrage of surrealism, making the impact greater.&nbsp; In addition, Richard Teitelbaum from MEV provided the soundtrack, which sounds exactly like you'd expect (which is awesome).&nbsp; The strange electronics add to the eerie sci-fi feeling and there's some processed sounds of insects throughout the film, which really affects the scene where two women beat each other to death with clubs.&nbsp; It's hard not to read this film through gender, as the characters tend towards the opposite behaviors stereotypically associated with their genders.&nbsp; I don't know if I can come to a conclusion about these attitudes (after one viewing) and the ending is a total head-scratcher.&nbsp; This is something I will go back to hopefully many times; I generally love future visions from this era and this is one of the most intense.&nbsp; Strangely, this is not mentioned in <em>Film as a Subversive Art</em> (nor is any other Ferreri film); maybe Amos Vogel just never saw it?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 February 2009<br />Religulous<br />Larry Charles, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm not a Bill Maher fan at all but I never pass up an opportunity to bash religion. This was better than I expected because it was actually funny.&nbsp; It was a bit mean-spirited, and the people he is attacking in the film seem innocent enough, but fundamentalists have caused so much pain in the world&nbsp; that I shouldn't feel any sympathy.&nbsp; Larry Charles kept this moving with the witty use of stock footage (in an Adam Curtis kind of way) and Maher is genuinely funny and provocative.&nbsp; For me, watching this is preaching to the converted but at least this has a pro-agnostic position instead of dogmatic athiesm like Dawkins or Hitchens.&nbsp; Ben Ren and I once got into an argument about Richard Dawkins because Ben felt that the fierce anti-religionists were just as bad of a problem as the radical Godtalkers - that they pushed all dialogue of spirituality into the extremes.&nbsp; I felt that because our culture (American in particular) was so radically skewed towards the religious, that anybody hitting back in a public arena was helpful.&nbsp; I still feel that way though I'd be pretty frightened by anyone that would set their spiritual beliefs by what Bill Maher told them.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />20 February 2009<br />Qui &#234;tes-vous, Polly Maggoo?<br />William Klein, France, 1966<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The first fictional film by William Klein displays some of the same oddball tendencies of <em>Mr. Freedom&nbsp; </em>and <em>Le Couple Temoin</em>, though it's significantly more conventional than either of these films.&nbsp; <em>Polly</em> is part-satire, part-fairy tale, and partially and investigation of celebrity and image, though it fails to commit fully to any of these camps and ends up being a slightly thin (yet interesting) film.&nbsp; The opening sequence of the sheet metal fashion show hints at a ridiculousness that is never realised.&nbsp; But despite this I found it to be pretty great, and probably the most sophisticated of Klein's 3 non-documentaries (perhaps because it's a bit more grounded in reality).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 February 2009<br />Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story<br />Stefan Forbes, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This made-for-TV documentary about Lee Atwater was fascinating.&nbsp; I had never known much about him as he was before my political awakening, but this extremely well-made film chronicles his rise and fall in a fair, non-sensationalistic way.&nbsp; It avoids making too many comparisons to post-Atwater politics, though it's clear he paved the way for Rove and Bush (and consequently the Iraq war and the murder of thousands of innocent people).&nbsp; Atwater's death almost makes you feel that there is a God, except then how could He have let Bush happen?&nbsp; The incredible success of the Obama campaign has led some to say that the era of Atwater politics is over - I don't know if that is true, because if Obama doesn't get his shit together then there's going to be a vastly deeper pool of cynicism to mine in the next election.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 February 2009<br />Grande bouffe, La<br />Marco Ferreri, France / Italy, 1973<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Ferreri's most well-known film which strangely I have never seen before, depiste Daniel Padden always wanting to have a <em>La Grande Bouffe</em> party.&nbsp; With Marcello Mastroianni and Michel Piccoli this film has some strong acting in it, but it's really Andrea Ferrol who steals the show, almost unrecognizable compared to her role in <em>A Zed and Two Noughts</em>.&nbsp; This is exactly what I expected - an extremely black comedy of excessive behavior, in the most 'European' of styles.&nbsp; As funny as it was, it wasn't as satirical as it could have been - the characters are only given a very simple background and their everyday lives are not explored.&nbsp; The self-destruction could certainly have been a commentary about the excesses of capitalist society, but it seems to revel in them rather than skewering the behaviors.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 February 2009<br />Next<br />Lee Tamahori, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>At first glance this seemed like an unbelievably shitty Hollywood sci-fi film, murdering a Philip K Dick story (that I havenever read). Then I realised that Lee Tamahori "got" Dick better than any other film adaptation of Dick that I have yet seen (though I haven't seen <em>Minority Report</em> yet).&nbsp; The opening sequence in the casino was the most accurate film portrayal of Dick's prose I've ever seen: desperate, bad writing; a seedy, cheap pulpy underbelly; something strangely otherworldly.&nbsp; The needless Peter Falk character also felt like the perfect screen version of a recycled Dick character.&nbsp; It's only when the film gets bogged down in it's formulaic chase/action scenes at the end that it's shittyness rises back to the surface.&nbsp; I guess there are two distinct threads of shittyness fighting it out - the Dickian shittyness (the product of writing 5 novels a year while taking tons of pills) and the Hollywood shittyness.&nbsp; Nick Cage is one of the most accomplished B-movie actors around so my hat is off to the casting director for landing him - his wooden style is perfect for the bad dialogue and formulaic characters that are in this film.&nbsp; The greatest Dick novels are pretty much unfilmable (<em>Palmer Eldritch, Valis, Timothy Archer, Martian Time-Slip</em>) but these "lesser" works are good feeder material for sci-fi film scripts.&nbsp; The basic idea of this narrative, while a simple one, is fun enough to provide 90 minutes of film entertainment - I'm happy to let the deeper issues remain on paper.&nbsp; So I liked <em>Next</em> as a disposable sci-fi action film that actually translates Dick's vision to the screen;&nbsp; I liked <em>Blade Runner</em> as indisposable sci-fi action film that failed to translate Dick's vision to the screen.&nbsp; Dick's vision isn't necessarily something we want to watch.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 February 2009<br />Touche pas &#224; la femme blanche<br />Marco Ferreri, France / Italy, 1974<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This Ferreri farce was so off-the-wall that it was hard to watch at times, but still fun.&nbsp; The four male leads from <em>La Grande Bouffe</em> are reunited in this bizzaro Western - an allegory about Custer's last stand, set in some weird grafting of Paris and the American west, but in the time of Nixon.&nbsp; It sounds great, and comes off like something written by John Barth or Robert Coover - total absurdity through which Europe's finest actors can explore the conflicts of the modern age (or something like that). However, only a few parts made me laugh out loud - Custer/Mastroianni's photo of his wife on his desk being a Coca-cola ad, the weird, ominous photos of Nixon everywhere, and many of Ugo Tognazzi's scenes as Mitch, the Indian assistant to Custer.&nbsp; This is definitely one of the more ridiculous films I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of ridiculousness on-screen; it's almost as this is the European arthouse scene's <em>Tropic Thunder</em> from 35 years earlier (with similarly mixed success).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 March 2009<br />Noro&#238;t<br />Jacques Rivette, France, 1976<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Ordinarily, if there was a movie about an all-female gang of pirates, I would imagine it to be an exploitative TnA fest.&nbsp; But this is a Rivette film, so instead it's a highly surreal, intensely choreographed fantasy.&nbsp; The DVD transfer of this was stunning, so the strange landscapes, seascapes, and castles looked absolutely beautiful, especially the scenes in the dusk.&nbsp; But the film itself was so cryptic that I'm not sure what I really took from it.&nbsp; Again, the artifice of the theatre is displayed, with characters re-enacting their actions in front of one another.&nbsp; Also, the music (an excellent somber soundtrack of tense strings and percussion, very Third Ear Band-esque) was sometimes revealed (after a lengthy trackng shot) to be played by musicians actually in the room of the scene.&nbsp; Geraldine Chapman is always enjoyable to watch; here she stalks around the screen, moodily, and seems to approach her own violent actions with a sense of regret. But this film, while certainly intriguing, lacks the sense of play that I like in his other work.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 March 2009<br />Boksuneun naui geot<br />Chan-wook Park, South Korea, 2002<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>These Park Chan-wook films have been on my to-watch list for a LONG time but I always seem to forget about them when I'm looking for something to watch.&nbsp; Last night I finally remembered so I started with this first of the trilogy.&nbsp; I was pretty blown away by the first half of the film - there were some stunning scenes, brilliantly staged and with a very powerful visual approach.&nbsp; Then the film totally shifts gears and starts investigating the interest in torture and pain that I've been in most recent Asian cinema.&nbsp; This was done with the continuing brilliance of the first half of the film, stylistically, though it felt somewhat less unique in terms of narrative.&nbsp; I really should jump more into contemporary Asian cinema, as Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong cinema is surely undergoing a golden age right now.&nbsp; This was a pretty incredible introduction, and supposedly <em>Old Boy</em> is even better...</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 March 2009<br />Hamlet liikemaailmassa<br />Aki Kaurism&#228;ki, Finland, 1987<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I've lived in Finland for six months now but have seen disturbingly little Finnish cinema.&nbsp; Yesterday I bought a book about the Kaurism&auml;ki brothers which made me think I should really see more of their films at least (so I can read the book).&nbsp; This was a pretty great distortion of Shakespeare, casting Hamlet in a 1980's Finnish business environment.&nbsp; Kaurism&auml;ki is so interesting because his films are whimsical, yet dry.&nbsp; There's a stylistically similarity to early Jarmusch, particularly <em>Stranger than Paradise</em>, but with a bit less of the noir influence.&nbsp; Although there wasn't really anything explicitly humourous in the script, I found the whole film strangely hilarious.&nbsp; The treatment of Hamlet rises way above a mere gimmick and becomes just a classic plot over which the characters can interact.&nbsp; The cinematography was grainy and monochrome, which worked perfectly; now, I'm ready for more.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 March 2009<br />Oldboy<br />Chan-wook Park, South Korea, 2003<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD<br />Company: none<br /><p>The second (and most highly-acclaimed) of the Vengeance trilogy magnifies the concerns of <em>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</em> exponentially.&nbsp; The structure has an epic feel remniscent of a fairy tale or Greek tragedy, and at points I felt like the whole film was on a hairpin trigger, ready to explode.&nbsp; The brutality of this film had a bit less impact, perhaps because I just watched it's horrifically violent predecessor or perhaps because the extreme characters made the violence less visceral.&nbsp; The muted colors of this film gave it a more distinct visual presence, though I missed the stark daylight scenes of <em>SfMV</em>.&nbsp; The video game action sequence where Oh Daesu fights off all the henchmen with a knife in his back is a stunning bit of choeography that manages to feel improvised while being pinpoint accurate.&nbsp; Again, Park focuses on little visual details throughout the film, which made it fun to watch and will probably get a repeated viewing.&nbsp; The double-revenge idea was pretty cool though; I see why this blew minds when it came out.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 March 2009<br />Chinjeolhan geumjassi<br />Chan-wook Park, South Korea, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: nonw<br /><p>I'm kind of glad to have wrapped up the 'vengeance' trilogy - not that I didn't enjoy it, but it's a lot of vengeance to take in a short time period.&nbsp; I like how all 3 films explore different aspects of revenge: simple revenge, two conflicting revenges, and finally group revenge, seen here.&nbsp; It felt like Park was reaching a bit more here, with more flowery artistic sequences and less brutal bloodshed and torture.&nbsp; I watched the 'Fade to Black' version, which is a good gimmick and I now couldn't imagine the film any other way.&nbsp; I have no idea what it's like to be a woman anywhere, let alone Korea, but I still get the feeling that Park's attempt at constructing a complex feminine character relies a little too much on stereotypes.&nbsp; Overall this was my least favorite of the three, though there were still a few stunning sequences to show off his abilities as a first-rate filmmaker.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 March 2009<br />Slumdog Millionaire<br />Danny Boyle / Loveleen Tandan, UK / USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I didn't think this was a good film, but BOY does it make me miss India!&nbsp; Only my intense Indophilia got me through what was an otherwise formulaic, sappy fairytale that knew exactly which strings of white liberal guilt to pull in order to win an Oscar.&nbsp; The thing I find most frustrating is how it presents an image of unrealistic success - great riches can be had if one believes in some abstract pursuit of love, rather than actually working hard or finding a solution to oppressive structures.&nbsp; It really depresses me that this film is enormously popular in India, but it just dangles Western capitalist dreams of becoming a millionaire through a game show in front of everybody's eyes.&nbsp; Sure, it's good to dream but India's problem is a collective one and these quixotic visions are probably more damaging than helpful.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 March 2009<br />Watchmen<br />Zack Snyder, UK / USA / Canada, 2009<br />Location: FinnKino, Tennispalatsi<br />Format: 35mm film in cinema<br />Company: Tara, Ode<br /><p>Paid for Tara's ticket;; watched w/Finnish and Swedish subtitles.&nbsp; Snuck in cabbage/pepper pancakes, sushi and popcorn. It's fucking expensive to see a movie in this country!!! Despite my extremely low expectations, this was a mostly awesome film.&nbsp; It's been a few years since I read the graphic novel so I can't pick apart the differences, so maybe I enjoyed it more with fanboy mode turned off.&nbsp; There were some terrible choices here (the soundtrack is mostly horrible clich&eacute;d rock classics, making it feel like some college kid's iPod was on random and jarring against the film's alternate reality; the sex scene was like some Skinemax/Emmanuelle in Space bullshit) and some awful acting (especially Silk Spectre) but the film pulled no punches from the complexity of Moore's comic.&nbsp; I thought this was a far better work than <em>The Dark Knight</em> because it addressed the complexities of politics and the structures of justice, law enforcement, etc. -- while Batman tried to take on a nuanced view of good and evil, it ultimately just reinforced superhero stereotypes.&nbsp; This is again due to Alan Moore's brilliance; even a douchebag like Zack Snyder couldn't mess it up.&nbsp; The flashbacks/backstory really captured the feel of the comic -- and I guess the cheesy dialogue and bad acting did too, as I remember the graphic novel being fantastic conceptually but just a bit tedious to read.&nbsp; Knowing that this is a self-contained story makes me more forgiving of the lengthy running time; I'd much rather have an extra 45 minutes now than some bullshit sequel in two years.&nbsp; I understand Moore's disinterest in film adaptations as the comic book form is probably ideal for <em>Watchmen</em>, but if he really wanted to fight capitalist systems he probably shoulda had more control over his intellectual property.&nbsp; It's sad, too, cause he probably would have enjoyed this film if he actually watches films, which I suspect he doesn't.&nbsp; There was something just a bit trashy about the whole production which maybe again explains my appreciation of it, compared to something like <em>Batman</em> which takes itself just too seriously. Actually, maybe <em>Southland Tales </em>is a better comparison for <em>Watchmen</em>, not just because of the apocalyptic subject matter or the alternate reality setting, but because of the weird pacing, artificial acting, and general tone.&nbsp; Sticking to the 80's timeline was essential; I never really thought about this when I read it, but <em>Watchmen</em> is a really interesting attempt to deal with the Cold War.&nbsp; I would even say it's sophisticated in its approach, though it's hard to use that term when you're talking about superheroes.&nbsp; I'm curious if there really is an overly-long director's cut that restores the pirate comic subplot - I'd probably watch it.&nbsp; I'll also be curious to see if I still enjoy this this again in a year.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 March 2009<br />Taxidermia<br />Gy&#246;rgy P&#225;lfi, Hungary / Austria / France, 2006<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Hungarian cinema interests me.&nbsp; This is a hard to describe film - not a 'horror' film per se, though it's focused on the body in a manner rarely seen outside of the horror genre.&nbsp; It's not a comedy or a satire, though it contains humorous satirical elements.&nbsp; It's structured so oddly that it's hard to think about it as a whole, as it really feels like three separate films.&nbsp; It's most obvious to compare this to <em>Delicatessen</em>, with it's exaggerated grotesqueness, though without that distinctly "French" feel.&nbsp; I saw this on a lot of people's top 10 lists for the entire decade on TermBo, and I can see why it might be a fun film to watch over and over, with others, while drinking - though it's paced slowly, there's a lot of memorable visual moments and collective grossout is the best kind of grossout.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2009<br />Encounters at the End of the World<br />Werner Herzog, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom / TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This Herzog documentary was mesmerising, and a bit surprising by how conventional it was.&nbsp; Despite Herzog's occasionally eccentric narration, this could have been a Discovery Channel documentary.&nbsp; Herzog's "crazy" self-presentation is toned down and he lets the film breathe, allowing the stunning photography to say what words cannot.&nbsp; The fascinating natural landscape of Antarctica is explored, but Herzog is really drawn to the human story - who are the people that work here, and what draws them to the edge of the planet?&nbsp; Its interesting watching this right after <em>Watchmen</em>, a film that spent millions creating a special-effects driven fantasy world (particularly the scenes on Mars) -- while the underwater photography in <em>Encounters at the End of the World</em> was more fantastic than any special effects could produce.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2009<br />Synecdoche, New York<br />Charlie Kaufman, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This has been a really film-heavy weekend (obviously I'm procrastinating from doing anything artistic myself, and also anticipating a soon-to-be 80 hours/week work schedule, so I'm taking it easy now) but this was two hours that completely obliterated every other minute of the weekend, the past week, and recent memory, really. My jury's always been out of Charlie Kaufman - I liked <em>Being John Malkovitch</em> when I saw it in the theatre, though my film tastes were far less mature then - and hated it violently the second time through.&nbsp; I liked <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em> enough but more for the subject matter than the treatment; <em>Adaptation</em> I found to be enjoyable but just as a neurotic comedy.&nbsp; But this was truly a giant statement; a work of art that succeeds on every level, and a justification for (and redefinition of) fiction itself.&nbsp; Of every film I've ever seen to employ clever postmodernist styles or metafictional elements, this goes far beyond any other in the way it truly utilises its structural Moebius-stripness as an essential component.&nbsp; This is the product of a mind on the level of Perec, Borges or Roussel; it's also fascinating how it can be so incredible depressing yet make me throw up my arms and shout "WHOO!" when it's over because of its artistic triumph.&nbsp; Beyond the refracted plot, which I must emphasise is not just a gimmick or novelty, the strong cast (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, always amazing, takes it to a new level; Diane Wiest is likewise fantastic) delivers something very affecting despite the apparently inhuman structure.&nbsp; I may sound like I am exaggerating how amazing this was but I'm capturing my thoughts right now, minutes after watching.&nbsp; I'll probably see this a second time and hate it, in which case I can look back at these comments and be embarassed.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 March 2009<br />Conceptual Paradise<br />Stefan Römer, US / Germany, 2007<br />Location: TV area / kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This video documentary explored the ideas and definitions of conceptual art through a series of talking head interviews with the field's most reknowned practitioners, critics and collectors.&nbsp; This was overlaid with texts from manifestos, works, and other publications that attempt to define what "conceptual art" means.&nbsp; R&ouml;mer was pretty hands-off, letting the artists speak, and never tried to structure the film with any strict viewpoint.&nbsp; The downside to this is that it tends to ramble, but at least it rambles through a lot of interesting territory.&nbsp; One compaint is that some ideas were mentioned but never really explained; Wittgenstein was frequently mentioned as the philosophical voice that started the movement, but the specifics of this influence are never elucidated.&nbsp; The film surprisingly had very few examples of conceptual artwork in the frame - of course, by definition a lot of works wouldn't be filmable, but those that do appear are more like fleeting glimpses -- admirable because R&ouml;mer obviously understands that a video excerpt is not a proper way to present any of these works.&nbsp; I learned a good bit from this, and it's given me some directions to follow, but I don't know if it would be very satisfying for someone who was looking for answers, as it tends to ask more questions.&nbsp; There's a bit in the middle where Dan Graham and Joseph Kosuth argue about who did something first, showing that there's still a lot of bad blood and egos fighting it out even decades later.&nbsp; The bits at the end that looked at the New York/Western bias of the art world were interesting, and a few Indian artists were interviewed who compared their inclusion into the "conceptual" art scene as tantamount to colonialism.&nbsp; The "post-conceptual" is inevitably addressed, but most unsatisfyingly.&nbsp; One of my favorite quotes though was Lawrence Weiner, talking about how a work of art, if one contemplates it long enough, should resolve its own questions (with the viewer's involvement), and if it doesn't, then it's not art, it's a secret -- and that secrets have no place in galleries.&nbsp; I'm surely misquoting it but it's an interesting thing to think about, especially given how much cryptic, difficult-to-interact with art I tend to see at exhibitions (not that I'm claiming I give all work I see the proper contemplation time it deserves).&nbsp; Overall this is definitely worth watching, because the roster of artists he's gotten together is astounding (Weiner, Vito Acconci, Yvonne Rainer, Dan Graham, Martha Rosler, Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Sol LeWitt, Valie Export, and many many more). This isn't in IMDB for some reason, probably because it was self-released.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />12 March 2009<br />The Room<br />Tommy Wiseau, USA, 2003<br />Location: TV area / kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>Two days ago I thought this film was just a weird Tim and Eric in-joke, til Agent Steed alerted me to its existence.&nbsp; Tara and I watched this and I'm not sure what she thought, but I was kinda of blown away.&nbsp; There's something impossible to describe about this film.&nbsp; Yes, it's bad, unbelievably so at times - though it is technically well-made.&nbsp; The lighting, sound, camera movement, framing, etc are all professional - it's not like some bad low-budget film with visible boom mics and murky shadows over eveything.&nbsp; But the non-technical aspects of the film are unbelievably bad, to the point where almost every single line of dialogue made us burst out laughing.&nbsp; Mr. Wiseau's own appearance, speech, physical mannerisms, laugh etc. were of course the greatest source of humour for us, but there are all sort of little things done wrong in every other aspect of the film.&nbsp; The hesitations between each dialogue, the way the scenes cut, and of course the plot, which manages to be formulaic and bonkers at the same time .... In general, I feel like I've outgrown watching bad films to make fun of them (apart from MST3K episodes) but this is much more.&nbsp; This isn't just "bad" - it actually feels bizarre and alien.&nbsp; If I had seen this in college I would have gone absolutely apeshit over it; maybe those tendencies of my tastes linger because I want to watch this again with different friends (and lots of beer).&nbsp; I completely understand the cult around this and I'm glad, because it's far more deserving than something like <em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 March 2009<br />Zack and Miri Make a Porno<br />Kevin Smith, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Another excreable Kevin Smith movie that I had no interest in watching until extreme boredom set in last night, and I figured I could at least enjoy seeing Pittsburgh in the background.&nbsp; I haven't tired of Seth Rogan but this failed to even reach the comedic heights of, say, an average Apatow film.&nbsp; I did laugh a few times (which is a perfectly acceptable benchmark through which to measure a comedy) but the predictable romantic-comedy element was annoying (though not as infuriating as <em>Chasing Amy</em>).&nbsp; At least this didn't reinforce conservative family values like an Apatow film does; the humour was generally pansexual as opposed to misogynistic, though one could argue that by presenting pornography as a fun, friendship-generating bonding experience with no negative sides it ultimately conveys a sexual violence far greater than a movie like <em>Knocked Up</em>.&nbsp; Actually after typing that sentence I now feel that this film is even worse than I thought; but it's my fault for watching it.&nbsp; Monroeville Zombies hockey team was a nice touch, but I just wish that Kevin Smith would never make another film (or at least stop setting them in my hometown).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 March 2009<br />Driver 23<br />Rolf Belgium, US, 1998<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DVD projected on wall<br />Company: Tara, Taneli, Marja, Jusso, Hermanni, Jason, Barbara, Melanie<br /><p>It's weird that this film isn't in IMDB and it's barely mentioned online; it's brilliant, similar to <em>American Movie</em> in its portrayal of a "loser" midwest dreamer but a bit more triumphant and genuine.&nbsp; The protagonist is everyone who I've ever met working in a guitar shop, everyone I ever saw struggling to get their mediocre local metal band on the map, and everyone from my high school with dreams who were condemned to work at Eat n Park forever - except multiplied by the most amazing spirit of ingenuity, determination, and a manic disorder.&nbsp; I've copied the sequel from Jason and I look forward to watching it soon.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 March 2009<br />Batman &#38; Robin<br />Joel Schumacher, USA / UK, 1997<br />Location: kitchen / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>I thought it might be fun to see the reviled, franchise-killing film that I have never heard anything good about at all, hoping to find something redeeming in it.&nbsp; Sadly, there is nothing worthwhile at all in this mess of a superhero flick.&nbsp; At least Schmacher went for full-on high camp instead of gritty realism; still, the special effects suck, the actors are phoning it in, and the quips aren't even clever.&nbsp; I take solace in two things: Clooney probably made enough money doing this film that he was able to finance all of the independent projects he was subsequently involved in, and the running time was under 2 hours (one good thing about 90s blockbusters compared to present-day).&nbsp; I still havent seen the Val Kilmer Batman but I don't know if I'll ever bother.&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference between this and the new Batmans is like the difference between the 60's and 00's <em>Casino Royale</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 March 2009<br />The Foot Fist Way<br />Jody Hill, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This Danny McBride vehicle was a low-budget comedy about a small-town Taekwando teacher, and I went into it expecting it to be some stupid <em>Meet the Spartans</em> type of film.&nbsp; I guess I had it confused with something else, because it was actually quite low-key and extremely charming.&nbsp; McBride shows his versatility as a comic actor here, for his Fred Simmons character was much more layered than his roles in <em>Eastbound and Down</em> or <em>Pineapple Express</em>.&nbsp; Cute kids doing taekwando is always funny and while this wasn't wall-to-wall laughs, it didn't overreach and I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 March 2009<br />The Fountain<br />Darren Aronofsky, USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>A swirling, psychedelic excursion that takes some cues from Tarkovsky, <em>The Fountain</em> is one of those films that people should use as an example of "when a director gets to make a movie exactly the way they want to, but the general public isn't interested".&nbsp; But why not?&nbsp; You can see Hugh Jackman cavorting about the astral plane, sepia-toned conquistadors stabbing ejaculating trees, and Rachel Weisz having a seizure in a museum.&nbsp; Plus, monkey surgery.&nbsp; This was cool - I don't want to use the word "ambitious" just because it deviates from a commercial formula, but Arnofsky definitely made this film without any concern for common-denominator tastes.&nbsp; Yet while I found it beautifully shot and paced, in the end it probably scores pretty low on Daron's Absolute Value scale - I don't think I could ever sit through this again, even though it was tastefully lengthed.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 March 2009<br />The Dark Backward<br />Adam Rifkin, USA, 1991<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Here's an odd one - a heavily stylised black comedy about a terrible garbageman/standup comedian who grows an extra arm out of his back.&nbsp; To be filed in the "Movies where weird things grow out of people" category, I guess.&nbsp; Rifkin's world is the main reason to watch this.&nbsp; It's like the rusticated future of <em>Brazil</em>, where technology has actually regressed, but without any totalitarian overtones - perhaps crossed with Dan Clowes' aesthetic in those early issues of <em>Eightball</em>.&nbsp; The grotesque is never really visible, but rather lurking unseen in every shot.&nbsp; But this grotesqueness is just for laughs, as his world is entirely without menace.&nbsp; Bill Paxton spends every scene in this film challenging the viewer to turn it off - he is as extreme as it gets, but I'm proud to have made it through.&nbsp; The film peaks pretty early when Paxton's garbageman character finds a female corpse in the landfill and starts licking it.&nbsp; I didn't find the jokes to be funny except for the ones that weren't supposed to be funny, and I think I could have just watched the rap video that's included on the DVD special features and gotten as much out of this film in 100 less minutes.&nbsp; Still, what can you expect from a Judd Nelson vehicle?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 March 2009<br />eXistenZ<br />David Cronenberg, Canada / UK, 1999<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I never had high hopes for <em>eXistenZ</em> because the virtual-reality videogame thing sounded so dumb, but a friend said he recently was surprised by it so I gave it a download, figuring that I should at least see it given my general interest things like this.&nbsp; I was surprised too, though less surprised since my friend's recommendation already prepared me to enjoy it.&nbsp; I sorta guessed where this was going but it was still cool to see it play out; the actual game involved was super weird, with mutant fish guts everywhere.&nbsp; Cronenberg's technophilia is evident through the bodyports and the fleshy controllers, which weren't really necessary to make the plot work but shows his usual fascination.&nbsp; And it does so in the same creepy way that you'd come to expect.&nbsp; This is by no means a masterpiece but it's worth seeing.&nbsp; It also reminded me of some Dick novels, particularly <em>A Maze of Death</em> but also <em>Palmer Eldritch</em> (and I noticed the fast food Jude Law was eating was from Perky Pat's!).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 March 2009<br />Cowards Bend the Knee or The Blue Hands<br />Guy Maddin, Canada, 2003<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>A Guy Maddin silent that follows the story of a hockey player for the old Winnipeg Maroons as he is manipulated by a family to commit murders and other acts of savagery.&nbsp; This didn't have the dazzling, mystical cinematography of <em>Brand Upon the Brain</em> or any witty narration/satire like<em> My Winnipeg</em> so I don't think I enjoyed it as much - however, Maddin is so committed to images that I was able to enjoy the world he created anyway.&nbsp; There were times when I sort of zoned out on the plot (which probably wasn't confusing but I haven't watched a purely silent film in, well, forever&nbsp; (as <em>Brand</em> had some post-production narration)).&nbsp; I actually found myself sort of enraptured by the soundtrack, which sounded like some old classical records that are probably Public Domain - but the static, the old strings, and the piano was perfect for these ghosty images of hockey and brothels.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 March 2009<br />Unflinching Triumph: The Philip Rockhammer Story<br />Mark Decena, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom / computer<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox and on laptop screen<br />Company: none<br /><p>A fake documentary about staredown contests sounds like a terrible idea, and there's something about this that resembles a YouTube sketch grown out of control.&nbsp; However, I was strangely won over by this.&nbsp; The actors are amateurs, but they do surprisingly well despite a few poorly developed characters, and the Phillip Rockhammer kid is just perfect, reminding me a a cross between Derek Sorg and Ben Reynolds.&nbsp; The filmmakers let the goofyness of the story take over a few times but never pushed into the realm of total ridiculousness, which wouldn't have worked.&nbsp; This wasn't a cinematic masterpiece but it was surprisingly pleasant, despite not being all that funny.&nbsp; I'm surprised at how much I liked this and also<em> The Foot Fist Way</em> - maybe I go into these comedies (which I often put on to fall asleep) with all critical faculties disabled.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 March 2009<br />Decima vittima, La<br />Elio Petri, Italy / France, 1965<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: Divx on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I remember a <em>On the Hour</em> radio sketch that reported how the Netherlands had decriminalised murder and that Amsterdam was being populated by a bunch of 'slaughter caf&eacute;s'.&nbsp; This film is similar to that concept - murder has been not ony legalised but actually institutionalisd into a game called 'The Big Hunt'.&nbsp; Actually a better comparison would be the film <em>Series 7: The Contenders</em>, which actually could be seen as a remake of this.&nbsp; Even in 1965 this film anticipates reality TV by putting a TV network and&nbsp; advertisers around the killings.&nbsp; Marcello Mastroianni is great as always, and Ursula Andress provides a good femme fatale, but the film never takes itself seriously enough to succumb to sentimentality.&nbsp; Being made in Italy in the mid-60s, there's a great design to the film - fashion, cars, furniture - and the few weird sci-fi elements are perfect in capturing that futurism absent from today's films.&nbsp; This is begging for a Hollywood remake, with, say, Jude Law and Angelina Jolie - except they would certainly fetishize the violence whereas Petri's violence is ridiculous and comic (showing not a drop of blood).&nbsp; The irony is so thick here you can shoot through it, but it's that wonderful smirking 60's irony that is impossible today.&nbsp; I loved this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />27 March 2009<br />Diabolik<br />Mario Bava, Italy / France, 1968<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This Italian adaptation of a classic comic book is so right-on that it should be more widely regarded as a classic.&nbsp; Bava alledged had a $3 million budget but made the film for $400,000 using painted sets, cardboard props, and weird perspective shots as much as possible.&nbsp; The look is amazing - of course it has that 60's European feel with amazing clothing and cars - but also there's bright comic colours and Diabolik's incredible underground lair, which is like a dream from Dr. Seuss.&nbsp; If you want to see an extremely poorly-dubbed Michel Piccoli, this is the film.&nbsp; All of the acting has this strained character, like a literal translation from comic books.&nbsp; I would describe this film as extremely campy, but a different type of camp than, say, the Adam West Batman.&nbsp; Maybe it's that "Euro" setting and the weird dubbing, or maybe it's just the look of the time.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 March 2009<br />Duelle <br />Jacques Rivette, France, 1976<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>These middle period "difficult" Rivette films sure live up to their reputation.&nbsp; This one is a total headfuck.&nbsp; I spent most of the film trying to unravel the plot and figure out who all of the characters were and what their relationships were to each other.&nbsp; The direction it moves in towards the end was a total surprise, and one that I actually think saved the film.&nbsp; Like <em>Nor&ocirc;it</em> this was a stunning DVD transfer, and the pacing, mise en sc&egrave;ne, etc felt pretty comfortable for me, now that I've seen a few Rivette films and I understand his style.&nbsp; This, more than anything else I've seen by him,&nbsp; explores more cinematic pursuits like mood and atmosphere through things like lighting and camera angles.&nbsp; I mean, I guess <em>Nor&ocirc;it </em>did that too but that was a pirate film so it was more of a genre thing.&nbsp; I can see myself watching this again, but not for a very long time, and maybe only if I try something insane like watching 5 Rivette films in a row or something.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 March 2009<br />Deadhead Miles<br />Vernon Zimmerman, USA, 1972<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX VHS rip, taped off TV, on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is truly an oddity - a rarely seen Alan Arkin vehicle written by Terrence Malick, about an insane trucker.&nbsp; It's kind of like <em>Easy Rider</em> minus anything countercultural whatsoever - this is 90 minutes of Arkin just acting completely fucking insane.&nbsp; At first it's a bit off-putting because I'm not used to Arkin with a hillbilly drawl, but it didn't take long for me to start appreciating his performance.&nbsp; The humour in this is really fucked up - not extreme, but just weird and nonsensical.&nbsp; There's strange errors in timing, and non-punchlines that are absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; Overall the film is just crappy enough (in that 'forgotten yuks' kinda way) that I suspect this will never see a legitimate DVD release.&nbsp; But the weirdness of the humour is not accidental&nbsp; - it's very much intentional.&nbsp; There's little if any plot, and a cast of extras including Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies), Hector Elizando, Loretta Swit and the great Allan Garfield.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 March 2009<br />Freebie and the Bean<br />Richard Rush, USA, 1974<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is a deeply flawed film but one that I mostly enjoyed, though maybe this is just the night to watch Alan Arkin comedies that also feature Loretta Swit in brief roles. As a buddy cop comedy this was far better than the <em>Lethal Weapon</em> series, though not as good as something like <em>Busting</em> (and not even remotely close to <em>The Laughing Policeman</em>, probably the high point of the American 70s police genre).&nbsp; Arkin and Caan are a good enough buddy team though I felt like both of them held back a little bit from giving it their best.&nbsp; The script wasn't so hot and the film kept resorting to awful clich&eacute;d police/action moments, at times resembling a <em>Police Academy</em> film.&nbsp; The last ten minutes were a bit annoying, as it felt like they were going through every step to ensure that all plotlines were closed.&nbsp; I'd have preferred a bit more ambiguity, menace, atmosphere, and style. This came between <em>Getting Straight&nbsp;</em> and The Stunt Man for Rush, so viewed between those two films I can't help but feel disappointed.&nbsp; But I guess I'm being hard on it, because there were some great moments, particularly Arkin and Valerie Harper's argument.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 April 2009<br />What Is It?<br />Crispin Glover, USA, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm not really sure how to articulate my thoughts on this, which are numerous.&nbsp; It doesn't really matter to me any more how contrived Crispin Glover's weirdness may be, because he made this film, and to follow Amos Vogel's definition of subversion in film (or maybe what I have paraphrased into my definition, which is that a subversive film is a challenge to some existing order) this is an utter challenge to culture, sound, image and body.&nbsp; Because I watched a horrible bootlegged copy with a terrible image quality and a blurred out watermark right in the middle of the screen, it made the images feel even more wrong and illegal than they already are.&nbsp; But beyond the visual mindfuckery, the sound was quite amazing.&nbsp; I couldn't understand anything that any of the actors with Down Syndrome said, which was pretty much everyone except Glover, but there was little synchronised sound anyway, with most of the soundtrack being collaged together from fragments on conversation, weird voiceovers, and Anton LaVey's organ music.&nbsp; It was about as radical of a soundtrack as I have ever seen on a feature-length film, and would be interesting to stand alone as a recorded work. &nbsp; If I am to try an draw some commentary from <em>What Is It?</em>, than the use of blackface and actors with Down Syndrome may be some statement about actors who are acclaimed for playing mentally retarded characters - that ii is akin to blackface.&nbsp; But maybe that's too straight of a reading, and it doesn't really matter anyway.&nbsp; The interviews I've read with Glover about this are level-headed, intelligent, and not at all what I would expect.&nbsp; I think he made the film he wanted to make, without any interference, and I commend that.&nbsp; The imagery isn't about shock or transgression, though obviously I wouldn't want to watch a naked woman wearing a Swastika-adorned elephant head giving a middle-aged man with Downs Syndrome a handjob with my mother (please sort out the grammatical ambiguity in that sentence on your own).&nbsp; I think the imagery as well as the general concept of Downs Syndrome actors goes far beyond extreme/shock/grossout stuff - what is much more interesting is asking the viewer to consider these people as people, but then also as actors 'directed' by someone who does not have their syndrome, and all of the layers that follow from that.&nbsp; I don't know if the second film will ever turn up (or if I'll be able to see a better quality copy of this one, not that I necessarily want to) but I feel like this film, whatever it's "merit" by the traditional scales of film criticism/appraisal, has triggered more thoughts in me than almost any recent film I can think of save <em>Southland Tales</em>.&nbsp; I might write more about this elsewhere.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 April 2009<br />The Killer Elite<br />Sam Peckinpah, USA, 1975<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is a forgotten Peckinpah, casting James Caan and Robert Duvall as employees of a Blackwater-style private security firm.&nbsp; The plot becomes a bit confusing at times but it all culminates in a huge ninja battle, sort of.&nbsp; The climactic scene is in a stunning setting, framed against giant steel-grey ships with ninjas crawling out of the ductwork.&nbsp; The actual fight is a bit disappointing, occuring mostly in slow-motion.&nbsp; There's no actual ninja style from James Caan which is why I downloaded this (the tagline JAMES CAAN NINJA MOVIE was too good to pass up).&nbsp; Some of the earlier sequences are executed very well, though overall this felt much more like <em>The Ostermann Weekend</em> than <em>Straw Dogs</em>.&nbsp; The sinister associations that the opening titles suggest, such as government assassination conspiracies, turn out to be little more than office politics.&nbsp; Still, there's something about this that makes it a curiosity worth seeing; definitely, if you're into 70's cinema.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />3 April 2009<br />Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?<br />Ulu Grosbard, USA, 1971<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I went into this film with low expectations, as I had never heard of it and figured it was probably forgotten for a reason.&nbsp; Surprise - I was mostly blown away by this film, which is an extremely dark investigation of neuroses and fame, full of hallucinations and whimsy at the same time.&nbsp; The tone shifts between comic and extremely heavy frequently; the comedy doesn't always hit the mark but it manages to keep this film from being a complete downer.&nbsp; In a weird way, there's something uplifting about Hoffman's goofy fantasies, even though his character is coming apart mentally.&nbsp; Maybe one thing I would have liked would be if they investigated the relationship of his creativity towards his undoing; his songwriting career seems easy for him, though maybe this is the point - a creative life comes at the expense of everything else (something I can definitely relate to).&nbsp; Barbara Harris is phenomenal in her scenes; they burn with a dark intensity and feel like they were directed by Cassavetes, not Grosbard.&nbsp; Hoffman is no slouch either; even though he's hiding behind a Dylan costume for most of the film he managed to really connect with me.&nbsp; I wonder if Dennis Potter ever saw this film, because it seemes it could have really influenced <em>The Singing Detective</em>.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 April 2009<br />Pierrot le fou<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy, 1965<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Pierrot Le Fou </em>explodes all over the screen, a whirling ball of energy and attitude.&nbsp; But being French cinema, it still takes time to reflect on literature, capitalism, and other issues.&nbsp; Formally, the film isn't as experimental as some of Godard's other films from this period, though it's challenging through it's content.&nbsp; There are some absurd moments here, both in a narrative sense and absurd by cinematic logic.&nbsp; Belmondo and Karinna are pure magic; some of the shots I just wanted to pause and dive into the screen so I could be with them.&nbsp; This had to be a big influence on <em>Badlands</em> and all of the subsequent films with this theme of reckless abandon.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 April 2009<br />92 in the Shade<br />Thomas McGuane, USA / UK, 1975<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I read this novel last year and was surprised to find that a film version existed, probably the only example I can think of where a novelist actually directs the film adaptation of his/her novel.&nbsp; This was a rip of a VHS tape, I think - the colors were extremely faded and it had that general 'old 70s' feel that a lot of things I used to see on TV looked.&nbsp; I wonder if the original film stock is better looking or if this is supposed to be really washed out.&nbsp; I would expect a movie set in Key West to actually look like the ocean, and the sky to be blue, but this looked like it was made out behind my house on a foggy day.&nbsp; Anyway, this film satisfies two of the Cardinal Rules of 70s Film: "See any film with Warren Oates in it" and "See any film with Harry Dean Stanton in it".&nbsp; There's some nutty behavior from from the Penguin, Burgess Meredith, but it's William Hickey that I enjoyed the most.&nbsp; Peter Fonda ambles through the film with a good-natured disposition, conveying the naivet&eacute; required for the role, but it all ends without the satisfaction that MacGuane's novel provided.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 April 2009<br />Reds<br />Warren Beatty, USA, 1981<br />Location: bedroom / TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Thank you, <em>Reds</em>, for helping me fight my insane/horrible sleep schedule.&nbsp; I've been staying up til 7 or 8 AM lately and sleeping til early afternoon, which is OK since I work from home but making things difficult socially.&nbsp; I wanted something long and boring to use to fall asleep last night, since I had to be somewhere at 9 AM, and it sort of worked.&nbsp; The problem is I didn't really find <em>Reds</em> boring, apart from the first hour, which I guess is a lot of a time to find something boring but when juxtaposed against the second 2/3rds didn't seem so bad.&nbsp; Actually, <em>Reds</em> is a fantastic epic and while I spent most of the film questioning the need to focus on the romantic relationship, by the end it all made sense.&nbsp; Releasing a film like this in 1981 is about as cray as making a film now that heroises investment bankers; it's utterly out of step with its time, which is not courageous in itself but kinda weird cool in retrospect.&nbsp; Beatty may be box office poison now (I'm kinda curious to suffer thorugh <em>Town and Country</em> just to say I did) but this shows his undeniable talents as a director.&nbsp; I don't watch a lot of "epics" but this did to me exactly what an epic should do which is provide a captivating, overwhelming experience that is universal and allergoricial as well as human.&nbsp; I'm not sure how much of the factual truth of this story was exaggerated for dramatic effect, so I won't worry about that here.&nbsp; Instead I can't help but look at the way these people lived (or the way their lives are portrayed by Hollywood, even if it's super lefty Warren Beatty Hollywood).&nbsp; Despite Reed and Bryant's huge involvement in the socialist/communist moments, their standard of living seemed comfortable and middle class.&nbsp; I don't know if Beatty wanted to eliminate the realities of class war in order to make the ideas more attractive but that might explain why there are very few visual signs of the horrors of the Russian Revolution, apart from one or two sequences.&nbsp; The mass deaths from the resulting civil war are just mentioned as a fact in the dialogue between Reed and Emma Goldman at the end of the film; we see more scenes of the Comintern's lush palatial offices than we do of the realities of Russian life.&nbsp; Maybe this was the intent - to show the inherent contradictions in any dogmatic system (and to mirror Reed's own disillusionment with the Soviet State) or maybe Beatty was being a propagandist himself and trying to sell Bolshevikism to the emerging 80s materialists.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I thought the scenes of Moscow looked more like Helsinki and the Internet says that I was right.&nbsp; Nice cameo from Gene Hackman too, and Jack Nicholson's Eugene O'Neill is amazing and creepy, though that whole storyline and character could have been removed so this film would have been a normal length.&nbsp; But then it wouldn't help me fall asleep&nbsp; - though I made it through 2 hours and 40 minutes before I did finally nod off.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2009<br />Tyson<br />James Toback, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Toback's biopic of Mike Tyson was made with Tyson's involvement and I think financed by him, so I expected a total puff piece.&nbsp; I was surprised to find a really intense, pretty relentless film that didn't shy away from Tyson's dark side.&nbsp; Still, I think the film was compromised a bit - such as the way the rape trial is skimmed over and only Tyson's side is presented.&nbsp; There is some incredible archival footage here; I was particularly struck by the fights towards the end of his career, especially his last fight where he admits on camera as soon as it's over that he only did it for the money and would never fight again.&nbsp; The 'introspective' scenes where Tyson is walking on the beach are completely ridiculous, particularly the voiceover content - I wonder how much of that was Toback and how much was Tyson's insistence.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been mildly fascinated by Mike Tyson ever since I read a Guardian article that looked at what happened to all of the boxers whom Tyson knocked out in his 80's rise to become the world's greatest.&nbsp; This film was pretty much all of the Tyson you'd ever need; despite its limitations I would definitely recommend this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2009<br />The Brink&#x27;s Job<br />William Friedkin, USA, 1978<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>William Friedkin directed this comedy about the famous Brink's robbery, led by Peter Falk and Peter Boyle (again playing a character named 'Joe').&nbsp; I actually like heist movies, though I probably don't need to see any more of them. This is a pretty well-regarded one, though I don't think there's anything remarkable about it.&nbsp; Every good heist movie has its <em>Rififi</em> scene, and in this case it was Falk's solo reconnaissance work before the actual heist.&nbsp; Friedkin for some insane reason decided to use a voiceover of what Falk's character was thinking, which sucked any atmosphere out of the scene and made it overly obvious.&nbsp; Generally this film seemed unable to find the right balance between comedy and suspense, though there were a few great images such as Allen Garfield succumbing to a tidal wave of small rubber balls.&nbsp; I liked pretending that Falk and Gena Rowlands were the same couple as in <em>A Woman Under the Influence</em> and this was just a bizarro alternate universe version of that film.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 April 2009<br />Liza<br />Marco Ferreri, Italy / France, 1972<br />Location: bedroom / TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's time to get back to the Ferreri films.&nbsp; This one is very similar to <em>Il Seme dell'uomo</em> except with the power roles switched around and a less fantastic storyline.&nbsp; This film could easily be read as misogynistic but I think Ferrari's satire is generally more complex.&nbsp; This film plays obviously with dominance and submission, but also investigates isolation, family, living with the natural world, and technology.&nbsp; I preferred the stranger visuals of <em>Il Seme dell'uomo</em> (and the soundtrack) to this, but Mastroianni and Deneuve are such a pleasure to watch that I think both films are worthwhile.&nbsp; This also features some of the best animal acting I've ever seen in a film in Melampo.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 May 2009<br />The Medusa Touch<br />Jack Gold, France / UK, 1978<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>As paranormal thrillers go, this one was fairly lukewarm though the ending carnage was worth the wait. &nbsp;Richard Burton is good in the few scenes he's in, laying down his style of utter wretched misery, but I suspect they only could get him for a few days of filming and thus structured the plot around him in a weird way that only let him be seen in flashbacks. &nbsp;The timeline of the film was chip-choppy because of this which actually proved to be the most interesting thing about it. &nbsp;Also, Michael Holdern was nice to see in his one scene.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 May 2009<br />Anvil! The Story of Anvil<br />Sacha Gervasi, USA, 2008<br />Location: kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>Anvil have a pretty good N.W.O.B.H.M. groove, though they were Canadian and I personally wasn't familiar with them. &nbsp;This documentary is one of those "can't go wrong" premises, and I think it would be perfect in a film night along with&nbsp;<em>Driver 23</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and the Metallica therapy documentary, as you could show three different stages of metal bands. &nbsp;Of course the protagonists of Anvil are portrayed with rose-colored lenses, appearing to be shining examples of humanity, but this is not a criticism. The film doesn't shy away from the dark side and the therapeutic, cathartic arguments and confessions are great stuff (especially when contrasted with Metallica's caviar-and-riches therapy). &nbsp;I would have been a bit more interested if the film investigated the passion of diehard 80s metal fans, but I guess I can always go make my own documentary about Mike Bolam some day.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 May 2009<br />The International<br />Tom Tykwer, USA / Germany / UK, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I love conspiracy films and hate investment bankers, so this seemed appealing. &nbsp;What I got was a slick, well-made action/thriller that unfortunately resulted to some of the most clich&eacute;d, formulaic tropes imaginable. &nbsp;Clive Owen is adequate, I guess, playing 'the investigator who doesn't play by the rules'. &nbsp;Naomi Watts is the 'sympathetic, attractive colleague' and there's numerous heavily-accented baddies. &nbsp;At least I was spared any of Owen's character's personal drama, as the film eschewed any family/emotional stuff in favor of making him single-minded and one dimensional. &nbsp;This was a good thing; more time for boring chase scenes. &nbsp;In addition to many scenes and dialogue taken straight from an episode of <em>CSI</em>, we also get 'the assassin with the telltale deformity'. &nbsp;However, despite my griping I'll say that the long shoot-out scene set in the Guggenheim is one of the most dazzling action sequences of recent cinematic memory and definitely the high point of the film - it was a distraction from the muddy political plot at the core. &nbsp;Towards the end the film finally gets some guts and raises some decent questions. &nbsp;I'm glad this film questions the futility of attempting 'justice' (or even defining the term, really) within the structures of capitalism though it's critique falls far short of something like <em>The Wire</em>. &nbsp;Of course, <em>The Wire</em> has over 60 hours to explore these themes while The International relegates them to a 5-minute speech by a minor character. &nbsp;This compression makes it feel like the fil has borrowed it's philosophy (or maybe just it's heavy-handedness) from <em>The Dark Knight</em>. &nbsp;It's kind of amazing that this film came out in the midst of a huge investment banking crisis/scandal, as these once-ignored puppetmasters are now the recipients of much derision from "average Americans", so this should be successful (if anyone pays attention to it). &nbsp;Even better is the current public debate about torture, which also applies to this film - not directly, as there is no torture in the film, but indirectly through the idea of having to sacrifice your own beliefs and values in order to achieve something, which the Bush administration was more than happy to do.&nbsp; The film's denouement is set on a rooftop landscape in Istanbul, and it's easy to ignore the cop-out Hollywood morality because the photography is so stunning. &nbsp;The closing credits suggest that good can triumph over evil, and I would expect nothing less from a product of the same system the film is (sort of) critiquing. &nbsp;Overall I found this to be a good two hours of entertainment and I will again mention the amazing action sequence in the Guggenheim; but when compared to a truly masterful film in the same genre, such as <em>The Constant Gardener</em>, I can only think about <em>The International</em>'s many flaws.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 May 2009<br />Straight Time<br />Ulu Grosbard, USA, 1978<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Dustin Hoffman's weird, hard to figure out but explosive performance made <em>Straight Time</em> kind of unsettling. &nbsp;Adopting a totally different vibe than the previous Hoffman/Grosbard pairing of <em>Harry Kellerman</em>, <em>Straight Time </em>is much more somber and gritty. &nbsp;At times I actually stopped caring about the plot and just enjoyed the vibe of seedy 1970's L.A. &nbsp;Harry Dean Stanton is always enjoyableand Gary Busey is actually a bit of a scene stealer. &nbsp;This isn't quite as bizarre as <em>Harry Kellerman</em> but a significantly more accessible film, even if I couldn't get a grip on where it was going. &nbsp;But I like films that shift gears, and I actually jumped a few times in surprise.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2009<br />Iron Man<br />Jon Favreau, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Iron Man</em><em>&nbsp;</em>may be one of the better Marvel comics film adaptations that I've seen, and this is partially because it felt a lot less 'Marvel'. &nbsp;The same narrative structure is there, but due to the lack of supernatural powers this felt like something that could maybe stand on its own as a sci-fi film. &nbsp;The film's scenario of middle eastern terrorism manages to be vague and non-specific, and a bit less Islamophobic than the typical Hollywood portrayal of Arabs (though, that's still pretty damn Islamophobix). &nbsp;The sequences of the R&amp;D of Downey building the suit were probably the most enjoyable, though it culminated in a super-CGI MechWarrior battle that didn't interest me in the slightest. &nbsp;Still, the ToraBora Family Robinson portion of the film was actually fairly suspenseful and you always have to love irrationally superhuman computers. &nbsp;The unspoken subtext of <em>Iron Man</em> is of course technophilia, and I wonder what a more adventurous auteur than Favreau might have done with this idea - say, a David Cronenberg-directed <em>Iron Man. &nbsp;</em>Though overall it was a bit long, it provided the necessary brainless diversion I was seeking (as I dedicated today to packing for yet another move). &nbsp;There is at least a slight suggestion that captalism inevitably propels the human race towards death, and it also manages to avoid the usual trappings of "FX porn" while still providing enough money shots.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2009<br />The Silent Partner<br />Daryl Duke, Canada, 1978<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Here's a previously unseen Elliott Gould film, made in Canada shortly after <em>Capricorn One</em>. &nbsp;I liked this, because I feel that Gould in the 70s is a foolproof commodity, though the film itself is slightly flaccid. &nbsp;The plot, as these thrillers go, is actually pretty cool and the script works okay (if a bit safe); the direction is probably the weak link, as Gould can turn shit into gold but the other actors struggle a bit. &nbsp;Also, whenever there is a potentially suspenseful scene, it ends up feeling a bit rote. &nbsp; The femme fatale is captivating though. &nbsp;The death scene was a nice adrenaline injection right when the film needed it, and anything set in Canada takes on a slight "parallel universe" feeling. &nbsp;I don't know that I would consider this in any way to be essential but a well-plotted Hitchcockian drama isn't the worst way to pass the time. &nbsp;Also, I imagined that this was set in the same shopping mall as <em>Waydowntown</em> was, only years earlier.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 May 2009<br />Salinui chueok<br />Joon-ho Bong, South Korea, 2003<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>On the surface this seems like a murder mystery/investigation thriller, like a rural South Korean version of <em>CSI</em>.&nbsp; But -- it is SO much more than that, yet I can't really say why.&nbsp; The film was painted like a masterful painting, all drab browns and greys, and the rain/tunnel motifs were great at creating a sense of isolation.&nbsp; After just reading <em>2666</em>, the serial killing parallels were strong in my mind as I watched, though Joon-ho Bong isn't going for anything as brilliantly kaleidoscopic as Bola&ntilde;o did.&nbsp; This may be a good example of the 'perfect' film.&nbsp; It isn't as overly flashy as the Chan-woo Park films, not is it particularly innovative or experimental, but through more classic filmic gestures it's perhaps the strongest work of new Asian cinema I've seen.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 May 2009<br />Turkey Shoot<br />Brian Trenchard-Smith, Australia, 1982<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I watched this as a warmup to the documentary on Ozploitation, which was good since it's probably one of the best of the genre. &nbsp;This film was exactly the same plot as <em>Punishment Park</em>, except instead of being done in a faux-documentary style, it's a more standard dramatic format. &nbsp;Also, it's incredibly trashy and gory and ridiculous, which <em>PP</em> wasn't. &nbsp;Accordingly, it's a great bit of fun and has some wonderfully gonzo moments, though it can't even be put in the same ballpark artistically as what Watkins did. &nbsp;I did like the inexplicably exploding arrows and the man-ape cannibal giant, plus the man bad guy being named Thatcher and a surprisingly high-budget part at the end where everything blows up. &nbsp;I guess it's good that it doesn't waste time pretending to be a political allegory and instead just goes for extreme violence. &nbsp;It is good to see what Dick Cheney's wet dreams are probably like. &nbsp;The documentary explained that this film was made with very lax safety regulations and occasionally real bullets were fired at the actors.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 May 2009<br />Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!<br />Mark Hartley, Australia / USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>This very flashy, busy documentary was quite good, even if it resembled a VH-1 talking head show in style. &nbsp;It's long, and it moves through almost every Aussie explotiation film ever made, but most of them are probably best views in clips so I feel like I had a good taste of the genre and can probably stop now. &nbsp;The talking heads drive the piece and they actually don't annoy me, even Tarantino who is actually qualified to talk about the subject &nbsp;The title is pretty lame though - they could have done much better, I'd think.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 May 2009<br />Southland Tales<br />Richard Kelly, Germany / USA / France, 2006<br />Location: bedroom / TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Another time through, but this time I'm blessed with the 160 minute cut that was originally shown at the Cannes Film Festival and booed.  Watching this again was a pleasure, though I think I prefer the shorter cut.  I remember the theatrical version having a dense, dazzling open section that outlines the twisted future of Kelly's refraction in a really overwhelming manner.  Here, he takes about a half hour and it's so slow that I almost lost interest - though I still don't think it warrants the hostility it usually receives.  Watching this again I'm still struck by how brilliantly constructed it is, and how Kelly's style of satire really misses the mark with most people.  There are scenes of pure theatrical camp, such as when Boxer, Krysta, the Senator and the Baron are negotiating in the room at the party.  It's punctuated by tongue-in-cheek dramatic revelations and silly thundercracks, but it's hard to distinguish this from the more earnest scenes of plot exposition.  Additionally, because a lot of the humour falls flat (or is just awkward), and the film is so thick with reference to T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, and Philip K Dick (I particularly like when the policeman says "Flow my tears"), it becomes hard to distinguish the variety of affects on display.  Of course, that's one of the things that I think is brilliant about the film - the way its so disjunctive both in image and narrative flow.  (For more on that, see that brilliant blog post I posted as a comment on this).   I really think that this is the truest "post-modern" narrative/feature film I've ever seen, even more so than the wildest experiments by Greenaway or Ruiz or Lynch (which may be brilliant but are really rooted in modernism/surrealism).  Kelly might be the first filmmaker to come to terms with cinema's potential as a transformative force while also maintaining an artistic basis in reflecting (or at least somehow maneuvering within) the contemporary.  Another reason this was probably a commercial flop compared to <i>Darko</I> was that <i>Darko</i> utilised a teenage melodrama structure to create a character that one can find empathy in, which is a traditional method of baiting film consumers.  <i>Southland Tales</i> doesn't have the time for that, because any sort of conventional character development is at odds with the pluralities of representation in this film.  It's easy to say that the social commentary about the Republican party, War on Terror, etc. is thin and easy (and already dated), but I don't really think that is the purpose of this film whatsoever - really, you can get that from <i>War, Inc.</i> or many other sources.  If anything, the Southland is one fork in any number of possibilities in the mid-00s, and the real exaggerations are in the role of media (which is the true center of this film).  Additionally the layers upon layers in the cast would only work with the pop culture icons that are here.  Dwayne Johnson plays The Rock playing Boxer Santaro who plays Jericho Cane, which could just be seen as an easy gimmick but I think it's essential to the context of the film's prismlike structure.  Anyway, I'm glad I still enjoyed this on the second viewing and I'm sure I will watch it many more times in my life, though probably not this 160 minute cut again.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 May 2009<br />The Heartbreak Kid<br />Elaine May, USA, 1972<br />Location: bedroom / TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Charles Grodin is totally amazing in this.  He does more with his eyes, just by blinking, than many other actors do in their entire careers.  This is much closer in feel to <i>The Graduate</i> than to <i>Mikey and Nicky</i>, though it's cut with a much more acidic undercurrent.  May's sense of comedy is top notch, and when behind the camera she has a good way of getting the performers to really connect with each other even when they aren't actually listening (as Grodin's bonehead character often does).  There's a constantly changing balance between charming and ridiculous that makes it til the very end; I totally understand why this is considered a classic, and it makes me want to check out <i>A New Leaf</i> next.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 May 2009<br />Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story<br />Jake Kasdan, USA, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Agent Beckerman turned me on to the Onion AV Club's "My Year of Flops" column, which provided me with an hour of entertainment last night. &nbsp;This film was included, which I never realised was a flop, but I guess it was the one time Apatow didn't strike gold at the box office. &nbsp;As these kind of films go, it's not horrible - definitely more enjoyable than <em>Pineapple Express&nbsp;</em>though maybe that's a bad benchmark to use. &nbsp;I like John C. Reilly, though he's a bit one dimensional. &nbsp;The music in this wasn't too shabby, as they mostly avoided going for "funny" songs and instead aimed for perfect pastiches. &nbsp;The whole rock star parody thing is a pretty tired trope but I enjoyed the silly Beatles/Beach Boys stuff, all the cameos, and Tim Meadows. &nbsp;I hate Pam from the Office so much that she kind of ruined the film, but I perservered and laughed a few times which is the point, I guess. &nbsp;I'm wondering exactly how many times the iconic Dylan scenes of the obnoxious press interview and the concert in the park have been re-staged now.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 May 2009<br />A New Leaf<br />Elaine May, USA, 1971<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Elaine May's first feature film is completely hilarious, thanks to Walter Matthau's over-the-top character. &nbsp;May herself is really funny too, and i can only dream about what the legendary 3-hour cut of this film is like. &nbsp;There is a totally unresolved subplot that is surely dealt with in that cut,&nbsp; and supposedly the original ending was far darker. &nbsp;Despite the compromised nature of this, this was still great from start to finish. &nbsp;A few scenes, like when Matthau is helping her with her nightgown, are absolutely brilliant. &nbsp;This isn't so much about nervous, neurotic comedy as it's about mocking the super rich - an easy target, sure, but one I never get tired of.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 May 2009<br />Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus<br />Jack Perez, USA, 2009<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm not sure what it means if the best thing about a film is Debbie Gibson.&nbsp; This direct-to-DVD C-movie shitfest takes on the 'What's the stupidest idea possible?' concept with a new enthusiasm, though lacking the self-mocking irony of <em>Snakes on a Plane.&nbsp; </em>(But that's a good thing, honestly).<em> </em>The CGI graphics are remarkably low quality and the editing was probably done with iMovie, but the film was paced well enough that I survived all 86 minutes of it.&nbsp; There was much to amuse, particularly the montage of scenes of the scientists trying to find a method to lure the creatures to a particular place - a series of colored liquid being poured between test tubes and beakers, accompanied by looks of disappointment or joy.&nbsp; Additionally, the submarine sent by the Japanese government is good fun since it appears to be staffed entirely by Asian-Americans who speak to each other in perfect Yankee English.&nbsp; I guess Japan has trouble developing quality oceanographers of its own.&nbsp; Of course, the only reason to watch this is to see scenes of a shark and/or octopus attacking a plane, and you get both though in such momentary glimpses that it can only be disappointing.&nbsp; The overall effect is like playing a video game but having all of the game sequences removed and only watching the cut scenes.&nbsp; We've entered a whole new era of low-budget filmmaking now, and while this would never compare to the joys of Ed Wood-style crap, I was surprised at how enjoyable Low-Budget Digital can be.&nbsp; I wish I could say that this was some sort of critique of the Bush administration's anti-scientific policies, or some metaphor for militarism and terrorism and envrionmental dangers -- or even better, a complex, layered satire on the media and entertainment - but this film stops well short of subtext.&nbsp; Besides, Chris Bachelder's novel <em>Bear vs. Shark </em>does a good job with that.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 May 2009<br />Mannen på taket<br />Bo Widerberg, Sweden, 1976<br />Location: bedroom / kitchen<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Agent Wichmann tipped me to this, a gritty, low-key police thriller that explodes in a stunning ending action/suspense sequence. &nbsp;This is the type of film that only works because of its setting (downtown Stockholm). &nbsp;The first 1/3 of the film is caught up in the internal aspects of police investigations, and it focuses on procedures and things that are generally dull. &nbsp;The characters have the same world wearyness that the cops in <em>The Wire</em> have, and this made it feel realistic compared to the general level of police dramas. &nbsp;The two young hotshot detectives provided a weird comic relief without actually being funny; throughout the intense scenes, the one character's headwrap continually undercut the suspense, but in a daring way. &nbsp;This was based on a novel featuring a recurring detective character, and <em>The Laughing Policeman</em> was also based on the same character, which explains the similarities.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 May 2009<br />El esp&#xED;ritu de la colmena<br />V&#xED;ctor Erice, Spain, 1973<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Wide expanses of Castilian farmland, parched by summer sun. &nbsp;The tense cloud of Franco hanging overhead. &nbsp;The father, pursuing his beekeeping, infused with some sort of mystical quality - but Erice doesn't go for for crystal balls and flying carpets, instead meditating on the earth and a child's imagination. &nbsp;Ana Torrent, her name a foreshadowing of the download method I would use 35 years later to watch this, burns with an intensity that's almost hard to believe a child actor is capable of (even more than her performance in <em>Cr&iacute;a Cuervos</em>). &nbsp; There's so many great images here, this is really a classic. &nbsp; I'm always a bit iffy about "films about films" as cinema often inflates its own ego; there's a tiny bit of that at the beginning, but it has such a dark side to it that it avoids the rosy goggles. &nbsp;This wasn't the kind of film that I found captivating - its slow pace actually made me drowsy, and I broke it into three viewings (though the running time is modest) - but the overall effect left me feeling warm and dizzy.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 June 2009<br />Burn After Reading<br />Ethan Coen / Joel Coen, France / USA / UK, 2008<br />Location: Tara's mom's front room<br />Format: DivX on TV via old Windows 98 laptop w/TV out<br />Company: none<br /><p>I totally forgot to list this but remembered that I watched this again while Tara was packing up her stuff.&nbsp; The second time through was enjoyable, though I originally had hoped this would have Lebowski-esque rewatchability potential.&nbsp; If anything it might be a bit too fast-paced for that.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 June 2009<br />JCVD<br />Mabrouk El Mechri, Belgium / Luxembourg / France, 2008<br />Location: Qantas flight QF051 from Brisbane to Singapore, seat 54H<br />Format: airplane-formatted on small screen<br />Company: none<br /><p>Even though Agent Strohm had already tipped me off that this was going to be disappointing, I hoped it would be something at least worth watching on a plane.&nbsp; But I barely made it through even when the alternative was <em>The Yes Man</em>.&nbsp; The premise could have been a <em>Being John Malkovitch</em>-esque satire on celebrity with the appropriate pomo/metafictional elements that used to excite me and these days just bore me.&nbsp; But instead of taking the satirical route, the filmmaker seems unsure of any direction and instead of committing to a voice vascillates between thriller/action movie and some sort of arty, genuine look at JCVD the person.&nbsp; What really annoyed me was the conscious efforts at making the film artistic - which were all incredible formulaic and did nothing except break up any sort of graceful flow the film might otherwise have.&nbsp; The whole disjointed linearity thing was done in <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and a million other things (and it served absolutely no purpose here).&nbsp; There was also a long unbroken shot of JCVD in the back of a taxi with windshielf reflections passing over him and a lengthy conversation with the taxi driver; and then, of course, the big "monologue" which felt totally forced.&nbsp; Of course, I was just reading the subtitles cause the flight attendant had broken into the PA at that point to announce every single connecting flight gate, so maybe I'm not being fair.&nbsp; And also, the airplane is a terrible place to watch a film so maybe if I saw this properly on the 'big screen' or even just a TV I would have given it more style points.&nbsp; As it was, the "print" was so dark and shadowy that any nuances in the acting of JCVD or the others were lost.&nbsp; Though the films have nothing in common besides being made in Belgium, I kept thinking about how I'd rather be watching <em>Ex-Drummer</em> again.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 June 2009<br />Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy<br />Kelly Makin, Canada / USA, 1996<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara, Rin, Will<br /><p>It's been years since I've seen this, but I remembered almost every joke so I must have seen it a few times back in the late 90s.&nbsp; It's a shame this film wasn't successful because it's pretty great.&nbsp; It's funny, sure - but it's also really dark and biting in its satire.&nbsp; I think I'm a lot more used to black comedy now as more extreme forms of humour have creeped into the mainstream (such as <em>The Office</em>, etc.) so this doesn't seem groundbreaking or anything - but it's just really, really good.&nbsp; Kids in the Hall have a way they can present completely ridiculous characters that are completely cartoonish, but somehow there is something multidimensional and human to them.&nbsp; Given the growth of antidepressants in the 90s, this film is very much of its time, yet it doesn't feel particularly dated.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 June 2009<br />The Shooting<br />Monte Hellman, USA, 1967<br />Location: Orion film theatre<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Jari-Pekka<br /><p>J.P invited me to go see this with him for free (since he works at Orion sometimes) and I never say no to early Jack Nicholson films.&nbsp; I wasn't disappointed by his performance - he enters the film similar to Orson Welles in The Third Man, and has some Nicholson masterpiece moments, such as the line 'I'll shoot your face off.'&nbsp; But, Westerns as a genre can be pretty dumb.&nbsp; The lead role in this film is actually played by Warren Oates so you know that's going to be good, though hs sidekick takes on pretty much a Jar-Jar Binks role and makes it hard to soak up the low-budget red ochre atmosphere.&nbsp; I don't watch a lot of Westerns though I often think that I should at least familiarise myself with the classic revisionist/countercultural ones.&nbsp; This film is probably balanced somewhere in-between but it wasn't too bad (and I rarely see films in theatres, so that is nice too).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 June 2009<br />Dune<br />David Lynch, USA, 1984<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Yeah, pretty good I guess. I don't know.&nbsp; I mean, I was lukewarm about the book itself so I watched this more out of curiosity, and I found it pretty tough going - I kept falling asleep, and I had to stop it a few times and watch it in segments over two days.&nbsp; Though maybe I'm just out of my film-ingesting routine.&nbsp; I can't imagine how this film would be even remotely comprehensible to someone who hadn't read the book.&nbsp; Nor can I imagine subjecting myself to the extended edition, which is apparently terrible and Lynch had his name removed from it.&nbsp; I don't think this was the absolute mess that most people think it is, but it wasn't exactly compelling either.&nbsp; Lynch's approach is pretty much the polar opposite of the Spielberg/Lucas mode of blockbuster sci-fi filmmaking - and the Spielberg approach is what I'm used to, so this seems really slow and postmodern by comparison.&nbsp; Lynch's dreamlike visionary stuff is pretty good here, since the story is somewhat hippified anyway, though the deep ecological vibe is largely subdued in favor of the prophecy/religious shit.&nbsp; Kyle McLaughlan is really good, though a lot of the other cast falls prey from cheesy overacting, such as the way Baron Harkkonen laughs (you would think David Lynch would shy away from stereotypical movie villain behavior).&nbsp; Much credit to his script though - it does a good job of containing a massive novel into an only slightly-long running time, with a few major changes that didn't really bother me.&nbsp; It's pretty 'normal' for a Lynch script, though that may be due to the shackles of the studio.&nbsp; The visual aproach is pretty fantastic - the costumes and sets are unique and fit in well with what I imagined when I read the book.&nbsp; It feels more like a big 70's arthouse film than <em>Indiana Jones</em> or <em>Star Wars</em>.&nbsp; But the narrative is a bit more complex than the cowboys and indians simplifications that the blockbuster directors figured out they had to use to suck in children, so I think it was probably doomed to fail.&nbsp; Even though I don't like Jodorowsky, I kinda wish he would have been able to realise his version of <em>Dune</em> w/H.R. Giger and Salvador Dali, but maybe some things are better as myths.&nbsp; Another thing is that the voiceovers showing the thoughts of the characters work really well in the novel - in fact, I'd say it's Herbert's major stylistic touch - but in a movie, it just comes off as poor filmmaking, like "we have to explain this to you because the actor isn't good enough at doing that non-verbally".&nbsp; Still, I would say this is more good than bad though since I'll never watch it again maybe I'm not being completely fair to it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />20 June 2009<br />Knowing<br />Alex Proyas, USA / UK, 2009<br />Location: Maxim, Kluuvi<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Ode, Jukka<br /><p>Wow.&nbsp; Where do I even begin with this?&nbsp; Well, I actually wanted to see this because I heard it was terrible beyond belief, in a similar manner to <em>The Happening</em>.&nbsp; I wasn't going to spent &euro;10 on a theatre visit but it was a boring Midsummer holiday and these guys were up for going to see a really bad movie - you know, like an irony thing, the type of fun thing to do with friends that I was never able to do in the UK.&nbsp; Anyway, I didn't actually know much about this film except that it was supposed to be terrible, and that proved to be very true.&nbsp; In fact, this was a flaming ball of shit wrapped in shitloaf, placed in a bag of shit and shat out of something shitty.&nbsp; However, it wasn't until the very end that the true shittyness came to fruition: this film is a mouthpiece for the Jehovah's Witness religion.&nbsp; The ending mixed up a little bit of <em>The Fountain</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull</em> with a LOT of <em>Close Encouters of the Third Kind</em> - sorry to spoil it, fellow PBTers, but I doubt any of you are going to waste your time on this anywy.&nbsp; Though you'll find lots of things to keep you entertained if you choose to subject yourself to this.&nbsp; I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in a theatre.&nbsp; There's some fantastic scenes, like Nicolas Cage frantically using Google, and endless explanations of any word that is longer than three syllables.&nbsp; Overall this rates quite high on Daron's absolute value scale, maybe a 9 or even a 10, though I'd still give the edge to <em>The Happening </em>for pure stupidity.&nbsp; This had a very similar feel to an M. Night Shyamalam film though with much more grisly carnage (the plane crash scene was slightly compelling, though the subway crash was far too CGI-drenched for me to enjoy, plus the physics were all wrong).&nbsp; After just watching <em>Dune</em> I really do miss the pre-CGi days; disaster movies used to fucking mean something. (Which is why you'll never, ever get me to watch the remake of <em>Taking of Pelham 1-2-3</em>).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 June 2009<br />Zach Galifianakis: Live at the Purple Onion<br />Michael Blieden, USA, 2006<br />Location: kitchen<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Will, Rin<br /><p>I subjected Tara's houseguests to this after watching the Snuggler episode of Tim and Eric, which is actually the second time I've seen this though I didn't seem to list the first time on PBT.&nbsp; This is a real work of madness, prompting me to wonder "Why the fuck was this released?" several times.&nbsp; Kudos to Will and Rin as I didn't expect them to last through the whole thing but they really wanted to make it to the end.&nbsp; Unfortunately the DVD was really glitchy when playing back, probably due to the Xbox DVD playback only being in beta -- so there were some jokes where the punchline got fucked up.&nbsp; But maybe that's actually better.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />29 June 2009<br />Crank<br />Mark Neveldine / Brian Taylor, UK / USA, 2006<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Some recent chatter on the PBT foru piqued my interest in this film, which I figured (correctly) would be a fun, easy late night watch after a fairly stressful work day.&nbsp; This was another film in the "morally bankrupt murderer is the hero" genre, but with crazy editing to further the 'adrenaline' theme.&nbsp; As an exercise in pure <em>dromos</em> this technique is excellent, though the film itself contained unremarkable attitudes, writing, and acting.&nbsp; Compared to <em>Wanted</em> or <em>Shoot 'Em Up</em>, I'd say this is the best of that miserable genre.&nbsp; The MTV-style montages were so relentless that it was impossible to even blink, and while I don't particularly like this direction for cinema, I accept it and cannot fight it.&nbsp; The telephone split screens were the only time I felt it to be TOO much, though I realised the directors had to keep the pulse going through inevitable exposition scenes.&nbsp; I'll watch the sequel too.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 July 2009<br />The Bank Job<br />Roger Donaldson, UK, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was a very entertaining heist film portraying an actual robbery from 1971 London though greatly embellished with a very theatrical dramatic license.&nbsp; Though this was very straight, it was such a compelling plot that I'm willing to overlook its many flaws.&nbsp; The early 70's setting wasn't so convincing and I'm sure if I watched it when less tired I would be able to spot anachronisms galore.&nbsp; Also, the black militants were so ridiculous and cariactured that I almost wonder if it was supposed to be a bit campy - I mean, wouldn't even the least talented scriptwriter in the world still realise how clich&eacute;d those scenes were?&nbsp; But complaining is silly; I got a nice mix of heist movies, British wit, and modern mainstream film sensibility.&nbsp; Stratham is good - I understand Agent Wichmann's interest - and i suppose I'll follow this with <em>Crank 2 </em>(even though I've never seen <em>Au Hazard Balthasar, Ivan's Childhood, La Dolce Vita, Persona, Lawrence of Arabia, Ashes and Diamons</em>, the <em>Three Colours Trilogy, The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, Tokyo Story</em>, or a zillion other films that I should probably watch before <em>Crank 2: High Voltage</em>).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 July 2009<br />Minority Report<br />Steven Spielberg, USA, 2002<br />Location: TV arae<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Though 20 minutes too long (like everything, I guess) this was pretty decent.&nbsp; It has the usual tight editing and snappy momentum you'd expect from Speilberg, with only a few annoying bits.&nbsp; I've never read this story but the washed out/whited out photography was a distinct futureworld that felt a bit more effective than a totally over-the-top landscape like <em>Blade Runner</em>.&nbsp; I'm not one to give compliments to Tom Cruise as an actor but he was fine for this, though the script made him a complete hero.&nbsp; A real Dick protagonist has his own motives at heart, and while Cruise's character was motivated by the death of his son, in a Dick book he would have been really trying to win more power or stature.&nbsp; The long action/chase scene in the middle got stale pretty quickly, but you have to expect that from Hollywood.&nbsp; I still stand by <em>Next</em> as the best Philip K. Dick film, but I think a film has to be a B-movie in order to really capture Dick's world.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 July 2009<br />The Transporter<br />Corey Yuen, France / USA, 2002<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was a massive turd.&nbsp; Actually, it was far worse than I imagined and I found myself unable to turn it off (since it starts well, and only goes to shit after the first 25 minutes, but by that point I'd made too much of an investment to give up).&nbsp; Statham isn't particularly good, though what could any actor do with this?&nbsp; The ridiculously inappropriate music was a highlight for me and it's admirable how the filmmakers didn't even make an attempt at respectability.&nbsp; The grease fight scene was a bit of inspiration in this otherwise by-the-books fantasy of masculine identity and car/object fetishisation -- after all, it's after the car is destroyed that the hero emerges, though the Asian woman I guess replaces the car as his beloved object.&nbsp; Dialogue was so bad I would have been laughing out loud, except it paled in comparison to <em>Knowing</em> which was still the pinnacle of Bad Movie Summer.&nbsp; <em>Crank</em> looks like <em>Citizen Kane</em> compared to this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 July 2009<br />Transporter 2<br />Louis Leterrier, France / USA, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>My descent into an action movie hole continues with this sequel, which is far better than the original.&nbsp; The weird b-movie qualities of the original were gone, however, leaving super slick fight scenes and some unfortunate CGI.&nbsp; I realised how much these must be influenced by the Roger Moore Bond movies.&nbsp; They have the same ridiculous stunts -- down to the leaping car seen in <em>The Man With the Golden Gun</em> -- and the bloodless yet superviolent killings.&nbsp; I mean, a lot of action movies are certainly influenced by the Bond films but it seems like this strain goes directly for the style of the Moore ones.&nbsp; Except these are also influenced by kung-fu movies more than the Bond films.&nbsp; The goofy French inspector sidekick is back too despite not needing to be here - it's a weird subplot that probably weakened the film, but the way they managed to work him in there was amusing to me so I was happy to see each of his scenes.&nbsp; I guess the third one is up next.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2009<br />Au hasard Balthazar<br />Robert Bresson, France / Sweden, 1966<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I could barely endure Au hasard Balthazar, for while it is a well-made film and deservedly a classic, it's an endurance test to watch.&nbsp; The beginning was just so incredibly boring that I fell asleep several times, each time thinking it had to be almost over and then discovering that I had only watched 6 more minutes than before.&nbsp; After I finally suffered through the first half, I was able to stay awake til the end, but then I found it hard to bear because of the bleakness. This is definitely one of the most depressing experiences I've ever had with my Xbox.&nbsp; Bresson's view of humanity isn't cynical or vicious, though; it just feels very genuine.&nbsp; Instead of some bitter misanthrope, it has an almost religious feel which makes its misery feel that much deeper.&nbsp; Man, rural France must fucking suck and seeing this poor donkey be treated like shit for 90 minutes is not exactly an uplifting experience for this vegetarian.&nbsp; I don't know if this is considered French New Wave or not - certainly the time period is right but it feels at odds with the other films of that time, perhaps because of its rural setting and traditional editing style.&nbsp; The narrative technique of using the donkey as the centerpiece of the film was probably unique for its time though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2009<br />Transporter 3<br />Olivier Megaton, France, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Well, the <em>Transporter</em> trilogy is now over and I feel like a better man for the effort.&nbsp; And, astute readers may note, I managed to squeeze <em>Au hasard Balthazar</em> in the middle of it all.&nbsp; <em>Balthazar</em> was directed by Robert Bresson, who I used to always get mixed up with Luc Besson (who is one of Arttu's favorite filmmakers).&nbsp; Besson is a reputable director of his own, though maybe not canonized yet like Bresson; relevant to this comments fleld is that he created the character of "The Transporter" and wrote all 3 of these <em>Transporter</em> films, perhaps explaining the overall Frenchyness of them.&nbsp; It could be that the French, having never really made many action movies, felt like <em>Transporter</em> was incredibly groundbreaing, to them, because of all sorts of little coded signals that I couldn't pick up on, as being merely a Francophile is not good enough.&nbsp; It's curious to me how the French characters speak English to each other in the first two films, but the esteemed auteur Olivier Megaton (could that be an Alan Smithee name from the French?) used subtitles for those scenes in this one.&nbsp; A noble gester, fer sure, except it's canceled out because Monsieur Megaton also chose to employ this weird stuttery effect on most of the kung-fu scenes.&nbsp; It made the film feel even more a video game.&nbsp; Call me old-fashioned but I still want my films to look like, well, films; though the fact that I watch all films on an Xbox maybe means that I'm 'asking for it'.&nbsp; And the cartoonish action is pretty overwhelming here, as Hero can apparently choose, at will,&nbsp; to flip his Audi to drive on two wheels.&nbsp; I guess in <em>Transporter 2 </em>he was able to jump the car off a pier and roll it in the air, striking a crane exactly in the place necessary to dislodge a bomb. And I still think these films descend directly from the Roger Moore Bond films, so these stunts should seem commonplace to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I like how the first film was about human trafficking, the second about bioterrorism and the third film about ecological ruin.&nbsp; <em>Transporter 4</em> will be about pirates off the coast of Somalia, I hope.&nbsp; It does feel like this one slightly takes things down a notch from the second film, but maybe my brain is just saturated.&nbsp; The underwater breathing-air-from-tyres thing was probably the best action/stunt/whatever scene in the whole trilogy.&nbsp; At least, it was significantly more creative than having them fight in grease/paint like the first two films.&nbsp; I am curious about the physics of that though - could the air within the tyres of a car be enough to actually lift it up out of the lake?&nbsp; And furthermore, the inside of the car was full of water so that fucker would be really heavy (plus who knows how much extra weight the magical license plate revolving thing adds).&nbsp; And even if so, Frank would have had to certainly top up the air in his tyres before racing off to jump his car on top of a train, right?&nbsp; Maybe that's a DVD deleted scene.&nbsp; I'm curious about the type of men that watch <em>Top Gear</em> and get off on films like this, though I guess that's psychoanalysis 101.&nbsp; What would be a more interesting paper to write is "The Idea of 'Europe' as Depicted in <em>Transporter</em>, The <em>Bourne</em> Trilogy and Other Action-Adventure Films".&nbsp; I probably won't get around to it any time soon so I'm putting this idea into the public domain.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 July 2009<br />The Accidental Tourist<br />Lawrence Kasdan, USA, 1988<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I wonder if this is the predecessor to films like <em>Sideways</em> - the whole "male mid-life crisis" film, except this one maintains an intelligent sensibility throughout the whole duration.&nbsp; I liked this, as it's a great example of first-rate mainstream late-80s filmmaking, and William Hurt is kind of amazing in his subdued, distant way.&nbsp; There were a few points where the script resorted to cheese and sentimentality - and I can't really tolerate Kathleen Turner in any context - but overall this explored loss, grief and emotion within the boundaries that Hollywood allows.&nbsp; Kasdan took great pains to make Hurt's family look quirky, though I don't see what the point was since I don't think it did anything to explain his character better.&nbsp; Ascending Geena Davis (aka pre-Renny Harlin) is okay, but I think it's more interesting to see her declining years.&nbsp; But this was probably a welcome refuge from most moronic films being turned out by studios in 1988 and I did enjoy watching it, imaging it as an 80s version of <em>Little Murders </em>minus all the humour/absurdity.&nbsp; I don't think I'm ready to try <em>Grand Canyon</em> yet, though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 July 2009<br />Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea<br />Chris Metzler, Jeff Springer, USA, 2004<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was a very well-made documentary about a region in Southern California where an artificial sea was created to stimulate real estate sales.&nbsp; The sea turned into an oversalinated, fish-killing nightmare and now the whole area is a huge wasteland populated only by weirdos and the desperate.&nbsp; The documentary is quite balanced - it portrays the eccentrics in a way that celebrates them without exploiting them, and offers hope that something good can come of the whole mess without being preachy.&nbsp; John Waters narrates and the overall film was nicely produced without being overly stylised or too slick (like so many documentaries these days).&nbsp; I really found this far more interesting than I thought I would.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 July 2009<br />Br&#xFC;no<br />Larry Charles, USA, 2009<br />Location: Kinopalatsi, Kaisaniemi<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Tara, Sam, Phil, Phil<br /><p>Tara bought my ticket.&nbsp; <em>Br&uuml;no</em> was one of the most disappointing things I have seen in a long time.&nbsp; The reason it was disappointing is because of S. Baron-Cohen's amazing talent as a satirist, which was not even remotely utilised to potential here.&nbsp; Instead we get a film full of easy laughs, cheap gay jokes, and manufactured uncomfortable situations that were brilliant in <em>Borat</em> but tired and unprovacative here.&nbsp; <em>Borat</em> was brilliant because it challenged Westerners to confront their own stereotypes about developing nations, even if those feelings were not overtly realised by the victims of the jokes.&nbsp; There is potential here to confront conservative Americans with their own homophobia, but it's done without a trace of subtlety.&nbsp; Borat, for all his ridiculous lines, showed SBC's mastery of physical comedy and subtlety - the awkward twitches, hand gestures, pauses.&nbsp; Br&uuml;no is more like a steamroller of the obvious, and I find it far less funny to see him tell an anti-gay religious activist that he has great blowjob lips.&nbsp; Not a single thing in this film comes close to the scene in the TV show where he got the frat boys on the beach to increasingly emphasise their excitement before springing his gay background on them.&nbsp; Here, the stunts are so over-the-top (filming a sex tape with Ron Paul, while it had me laughing, it just too farfetched; the 'Straight Dave' sequence at the end was similarly obvious) that they actually made me question how pre-staged some of the events were.&nbsp; I've seen <em>Thundercrack</em> and other transgressive material enough that I'm not shocked by penises, buttsex or extreme homosexual practices; I just found it to be shock value humour not even as creative as, say, Tom Green wearing a dead deer carcass in <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em>.&nbsp; I'm sure that fratboys all across the country will be shocked and want to bleach their eyes after seeing this, but the biggest crime of all is that there is nothing about Br&uuml;no to cause them to question or change their attitudes.&nbsp; The script was so goofy that there is no way anyone can establish any empathy with the character; Br&uuml;no is vain, shallow and rather unlikeable regardless of his sexual orientation.&nbsp; I watch plenty of lowbrow comedy without much socially redeeming value; however, I expect <em>Step Brothers</em> to be stupid and absurd, while <em>Br&uuml;no</em> operated in the realm of satire but minus anything of value.&nbsp; SBC could have satirised the European fashion world instead but that's just as tired - I doubt there's anything that needs to be further said about that culture.&nbsp; So really, there's no reason to stretch this TV character into a feature film - you might as well make another Saturday Night Live movie like <em>It's Pat</em>.&nbsp; Yeah, I laughed, but those laughs came from the wrong part of my brain.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 July 2009<br />Role Models<br />David Wain, USA / Germany, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>David Wain's work on the Stella shorts is brilliant and I like 'Wainy Days' too - he's great at packing lots of stupid material into really dense, short packages.&nbsp; In the feature film format I think he suffers, particularly here when trying to do something relentlessly mainstream.&nbsp; There were a lot of writers and a lot of decent comedic talent here, but only Jane Lynch manages to really transcend the weak script and bring something special to the film.&nbsp; Otherwise the story is tired, the jokes are tired, and there's too much slow exposition.&nbsp; The whole premise is a bit flawed anyway since the two lead characters aren't really bad people to begin with - just shallow and dickish, as opposed to criminals or degenerates.&nbsp; If anything, they are prime examples of the type of person capitalist society raises you to be.&nbsp; The film doesn't play with this idea at all, and it doesn't even go the really juvenile route with tons of sexual humour a la Apatow - instead it just feels really tame.&nbsp; I wish Wain would make a film like <em>Anchorman</em>, where he just goes balls out with the absurdity - but maybe that's what <em>Wet Hot American Summer </em>was (which I will rewatch soon).&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 July 2009<br />Themroc<br />Claude Faraldo, France, 1973<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Marja, Taneli<br /><p>Themroc deserves to be listed among the greatest absurd films of all-time, especially as it stars Michel Piccoli, whose resum&eacute; of absurdity is pretty astounding.&nbsp; It's hard to believe that he was in this, <em>Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie</em>, <em>La Grand Bouffe, Don't Touch the White Woman!</em> and<em> Dillinger e Morto.</em>&nbsp; But this might be his greatest role of all. I hadn't seen this in ages, and not such a good quality copy, so it was like seeing something revelatory, for the first time.&nbsp; There's a lot that can be analyzed about this film but I don't think there's any sense in overintellectualising it.&nbsp; It's really just an insane experience that is very satisfying to watch.&nbsp; We thought it was good how most French films of the time (specifically Nouvelle Vague stuff) tends to celebrate Paris, even if it's illustrating the poor.&nbsp; But in <em>Themroc</em>, Paris is an absolute fucking shithole. It's also great that this film uses gibberish instead of actual language, cause it makes it feel somehow 'universal'.&nbsp; And the ending sequence is dazzling, beautiful, and extreme, and outdoes even <em>L'Eclisse</em>.&nbsp; If Adam Strohm and Andy Beckerman haven't seen this yet they should not watch anything until they do.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 July 2009<br />Los cronocr&#xED;menes<br />Nacho Vigalondo, Spain, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I really enjoyed this but I just like time-travel movies.&nbsp; Of course this is little more than a somewhat simplified <em>Primer</em>, in Spanish, with a nice pair of tits, but I got pretty wrapped up in it by the end.&nbsp; The setting was pleasantly disorientating, and I sorta enjoyed the abuse (and questionable behavior) of the protagonist.&nbsp; I'd watch this again, or at least recommend it to Tara.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />20 July 2009<br />&#192; bout de souffle<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1960<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Getting an 11-DVD Godard box set for &euro;9.99 has reinvigorated my plan to watch Godard's completely filmography (well, at least all of the features) in chronological order, which means starting with this one.&nbsp; This is the first time I've ever seen this in widescreen and the difference is astounding, as I previously though this wasn't something I'd ever be able to sit through again.&nbsp; It's hard to say something poignant here about one of the few films that truly changed the history of cinema forever.&nbsp; Though the first and third acts are the really explosive freewheeling parts that set the world on fire, I really clicked with the second act, particularly the long scene in Seberg's room.&nbsp; In addition to the technical innovation and the European recombination of film noir/gangster/arthouse elements, <em>&Agrave; bout de souffle</em> really makes Seberg's character the soul of the film, which isn't so obvious behind Belmondo's clowning around.&nbsp; Writing a meaningful review here is like writing a review of DaVinci's <em>Last Supper</em> or something, so I'll just say that I was really into this, a thousand times more than when I first saw it in college on VHS - whether my new appreciation is due to maturity, my deeper interest in film today vs. then, or the superiority of seeing a film in its proper aspect ratio I'm not sure - perhaps a combination of all three.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 July 2009<br />Wet Hot American Summer<br />David Wain, USA, 2001<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>High expectations were met with disappointment though I would maybe bump this up the slightest bit from my original 2001 appraisal.&nbsp; Well, actually I still only found about five or six moments funny but the rest I was able to tolerate now as gently amusing comedy-parody, while back then I just hated it.&nbsp; It's kind of fun playing "spot the future stars of alternative comedy" in this but once you're finished with that there's still another hour to make it through.&nbsp; I'm not really sure why this became such a big 'cult' film that people watch over and over.&nbsp; At least with something like <em>Lebowski</em> you have brilliant dialogue, characters with hilarious nuances/quirks, and a steady stream of things to love.&nbsp; <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> is actually very slow - there's huge stretches without any humour, or just failed jokes.&nbsp; My favorite moment (which was Tara's too) is when they get back from the city and all run up against the side of a building - it's only in the corner of the frame and they don't overdo it in the usual <em>State</em> way of lingering on the jokes - and it hints at what this could have been if it were much more absurd and nonsensical.&nbsp; I agree with my original view that parodying a genre that is already pretty much self-parody is a flawed concept, and maybe I'm still yet to be convinced by a long-form David Wain production.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 July 2009<br />Un tranquillo posto di campagna<br />Elio Petri, Italy / France, 1969<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Heather and David were raving about this and I loved L<em>a Decima Vittima</em> so I gave this a spin.&nbsp; When I started I expected it to be more along the satirical lines of the previous film, given the exaggerated modernism of the setting - but then the film quickly shifted into something rather undescribable.&nbsp; I was going to say how this was a ghost story on the surface but actually not at all; but that's not true because it actually is a ghost story.&nbsp; But it's much much darker because of the frightening sexual/psychological elements introduced.&nbsp; Genre-blending for sure - there's elements of horror/giallo, drama, satire, and erotic film, but it's somehow elusive of any specific place.&nbsp; The lead character is intensely hard to read despite being so emotional and bare; I'm pretty sure Petri intended for us to think he's a bit of a douchebag, with his comments about participating in the art market and his rampant sexual harassment.&nbsp; It's the classic film stereotype of the 'tortured artist', appearing to be sympathetic to him but actually not sympathetic at all.&nbsp; His submersion in pornography and other sexual imagery is very linked to his unraveling, and to violence; it reminds me a bit of what Grant Morrison was doing with The Filth, though in a completey different genre.&nbsp; The spooky cinematography of the Venetian villa is beautiful (though this DivX was only 700MB so some of the darker scenes were unfortunately quite pixelated) and disorientating, possibly an influence on Argento's <em>Suspiria</em>.&nbsp; The "Fellini" scenes were essential to the film, though I think Petri gave them their own identity by binding them so closely with the plot's ambiguity and the character's own problems.&nbsp; There's an amazing Ennio Morricone soundtrack on everything, sometimes sounding like Ashtray Navigations and sometimes sounding like Spike Jones and his City Slicker Orchestra.&nbsp; I think Petri is something I really need to investigate further because this film, which I would maybe say is a masterpiece, shows an incredible talent/depth that I didn't expect at all.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 July 2009<br />Le petit soldat<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1963<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Since I got 10 Godard films in a box set for &euro;9.99, I'm listing each as costing &euro;0.99.&nbsp; Though not released until '63, this was filmed in 1960 so i thought it best to watch after <em>&Agrave; bout de souffle</em>.&nbsp; This was interesting, as it was caught up in the politics of the Algerian war, though for the first 2/3 of the film the politics seemed like an afterthought; Bruno is a covert operative who has no particular ideology of his own.&nbsp; The films seems to be equally cautious about committing to a viewpoint - it's not until the end that it asserts a more confrontational edge.&nbsp; The noirish elements are pretty well done, and the low budget gives things a grittyness (plus Geneva is a great setting for espionage films).&nbsp; After a fairly brutal torture sequence (for its day), we get a long monologue delivered to Anna Karina about nationalism and identity.&nbsp; It's surprisingly middle-of-the-road and I wonder if Godard later renounced this view, particularly during his extremely political period in the late 60s/early 70s.&nbsp; You can see a lot of elements that occur in all of his films, such as the conflicts of politics and everyday life, and a critique of male attitudes toward women.&nbsp; The overall problem for Bruno is that he is a cog stuck in a brutal system he can't control; this theme isn't developed much, at least not as much as in <em>The Wire</em>, but it's here for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Karina is beautiful in this but her role is somewhat passive, lacking the complexity of Jean Seberg in the previous film.&nbsp; The DVD comes with an introduction by Colin MacCabe, whom I was lucky enough to have teach a Joyce course when I was at Pitt (definitely the highlight of my undergraduate life, or tied with 'Experimental Cinema').&nbsp; Also the Algeian setting reminds me that I've still never seen <em>Battle of Algiers</em> -- so perhaps it is time.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 July 2009<br />The Hangover<br />Todd Phillips, USA, 2009<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm glad I waited to download this, because it wouldn't have been worth &euro;11 in a theatre - though I paid money to see <em>Knowing</em> so I guess I have no right to say that.&nbsp; This comedy was very safe and very by-the-books 'crazy'.&nbsp; I agree completely with Agent Beckerman's statement re: female characters - the whole 'brohmance' thing is really getting tiresome and this was particularly weak as it didn't even play up the latent homosexual urges inherent in the genre.&nbsp; At least <em>The 40-Year Old Virgin</em> had some sophisticated female characters and managed to be a fuck of a lot funnier than this; I guess <em>Virgin</em> is probably the high water mark for this whole genre.&nbsp; I really just wanted to see Zach Galafianakis in a successful mainstream movie, and while he was the funniest character, the script was so weak that I wished he had been able to write it himself.&nbsp; Honestly, I at least expected to laugh a bit more than I did.&nbsp; Carrot Top in the closing photo montage was probably the funniest element.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 July 2009<br />Une femme est une femme<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Italy / France, 1961<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The filmed introduction to this by Colin MacCabe warned that this is pretty much as joyous as a Godard film ever gets.&nbsp; This is a deconstruction of the musical comedy genre, much more influenced by French styles of humour than his first two films, which are heavily American-influenced - but then run to ruin through bizarre sound editing techniques.&nbsp; This film is very playful, and the three leads are a delight to watch, but the ridiculous melodramatic soundtrack - which cuts in and out to mock film soundtracks - becomes a bit tiresome.&nbsp; Karina, playing a striptease artist, is beautiful for sure, but I wonder if her desire for a child isn't made into something a bit simplistic.&nbsp; The role of femininity as commodity is explored a bit, though the film avoids getting into anything heavy-handed and just enjoys itself.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 July 2009<br />The Hurt Locker<br />Kathryn Bigelow, USA, 2008<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>I'm not usually into war films, and I don't know anything about the genre.&nbsp; But I think I can say with confidence that <em>The Hurt Locker</em> is fantastic, and definitely one of the exemplary films of the genre that I've seen.&nbsp; It's intense, and it's impossible to relax throughout the entire runtime, but it's genuinely thrilling entertainment and it avoids explicit editorialising which is somewhat nice.&nbsp; I guess <em>Three Kings </em>is the only other Iraq War film I've ever seen, and that was the first Iraq war, but the tone couldn't be more different.&nbsp; This is brutal, realistic, and the use of no-name actors (at least, no one I recognised) made it feel more compelling.&nbsp; I should probably watch <em>Generation Kill</em> soon.&nbsp; But yeah, this is totally a must-see intense film experience and while I guess it's fictional, I'm sure the actual combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan are every bit as intense as what's depicted here. And while it's hard for me to sympathise with anyone serving in the American military, this film succeeded in carving through my own exterior by making me fascinated with the characters -- even though the film did little to portray them outside of their work.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 July 2009<br />Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1962<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The next entry in the Godard sequence, though reasonably brief, wasn't the most enjoyable Godard film I've seen.&nbsp; There were segments that bored me, but I still found a lot to think about.&nbsp; The one thread that's tied together all of these films so far is that Godard is continually assaulting cinematic forms and content.&nbsp; Here, the formal experimentation was scaled back a bit from <em>Breathless</em>'s jump cuts and <em>Une femme est une femme</em>'s soundtrack.&nbsp; Apart from the titles on the screen in scene 12 (and, I guess the structure of the film into 12 <em>tableaux</em>) it wasn't a particularly innovative work, formally.&nbsp; But content-wise, Godard potrays the life of a prostitute which was surely taboo subject matter, even in France, in 1962.&nbsp; Parts of this film are like an altar to the beauty of Anna Karina, by then his wife - such as the opening titles and the scenes at the end that just study her face, head, profile, etc.&nbsp; I wonder about the power dynamic of their relationship, where in two sucessive films he casts her as first a stripper, then a prostitute - though there is very little exploitation of her body here.&nbsp; The long conversation in scene 11, touching on German philosophy, is quintessential arthouse matter; the sudden intrusions of violence in the film are perplexing though, particularly the ending which feels tacked on.&nbsp; Karina is a great actress - throughout the first half of the film, she conveys a woman stuck in-between choices.&nbsp; There's just the right mixture of ennui, desperation, and confidence in her facial expressions that I could immediately empathise.&nbsp; It's crazy how this film is almost 50 years old but the dilemmas can feel so contemporary, even though the actual situation is quite removed from my life.&nbsp; The life of prostitution is portrayed fairly objectively, or at least it avoids glamourising the lifestyle or highly moralising about it.&nbsp; The passages of Q&amp;A dialogue were great, reminding me of that chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />29 July 2009<br />Nuit noire<br />Olivier Smolders, Belgium, 2005<br />Location: TV ara<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was an immensely thick slice of surrealism that was relentless in its imagery and atmospherics.&nbsp; In many ways it felt like a compendium of other surreal films, but it also had some meat between its slices.&nbsp; This and <em>Cach&eacute;</em> are probably the two best French-language films I've seen in recent years, and both tackle the issue of race head-on, certainly a volatile subject in contemporary France.&nbsp; But this bound whatever racial issues it was addressing along with psychology and sexuality into something that is much harder to disassemble.&nbsp; The stylistic approach made it easy to get lost and just let the images wash over everything, and I found the overall structure fairly perplexing, but films with such a strong visual sense can survive on that alone (sometimes).&nbsp; I'm curious about what motivates Mr. Smoulders, and I'd like to see his other work; this debut, while not the most original voice even among surrealist cinema itself, shows his ambition and many preoccupations that I'm happy to see explored further.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2009<br />M&#233;pris, Le<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy, 1963<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Seeing Le M&eacute;pris again was an utter pleasure, though the film is so dark and intense at points that I felt quite affected by the drama.&nbsp; The Delerue soundtrack is occasionally overbearing, but it serves to emphasise the intensity of the scenes, unlike <em>Une femme</em>'s mocking soundtrack intrusions. The young Michel Piccoli is a beauty; I wonder what's the signifigance of his hat always being on?&nbsp; The ending is so weird and tacked on; quite a bizarre twist but perhaps that was in the Moravia novel?&nbsp; This really is about the meeting of high art with consumer capitalism, or European art film meets Hollywood.&nbsp; I'd like to read more about the backstory behind this, as apparently Godard and Palance clashed much like the script would suggest; this ends up being by far the most conventional of Godard's films, at least so far, at least formally.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2009<br />Ocean's Eleven<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA / Australia, 2001<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I figured watching the three Oceans films in a row could be the next trilogy of time-wastin' for me.&nbsp; This was fun and fast-paced as I expected, belonging to the genre of heist films where "the plan is crazy but they get away with it" (<em>The Bank Job, The Brink's Job</em>) as opposed to the "simple plan where everything goes wrong" (every Coen brothers movie).&nbsp; Elliott Gould was pretty great though he didn't get enough screen time.&nbsp; You can tell the actors had fun making this; I don't know how the fuck they'll stretch this for two sequels but I guess I'll see.&nbsp; Never saw the original but I don't know if I'll ever bother.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2009<br />Ocean&#x27;s Twelve<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2004<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is one of those films that I would think was a really shitty sequel, but because I like Soderbergh, I see it as a crazy playful in-joke that revels in its own messy anarchy.&nbsp; The plot is completely stupid and contrived, even ludicrously so, and I wonder if Soderbergh did the whole thing just so he could do the Julia Roberts bit (which is great not because it's clever metafiction or post-modern commentary on celebrity, but because it was really really funny).&nbsp; The tone is very different than the first movie - it's all jokes and gags and pointless excursions, all wrapped around a story that's pretty hard to follow and not really worth it anyway.&nbsp; At some point I got the feeling that absolutely nobody was taking this seriously so it was pretty fun, though overly long.&nbsp; The thought of watching the third one is not in any way appealing, but since I've come this far, i have to finish it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2009<br />Ocean's Thirteen<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Well, Bernie Mac is dead so that means no <em>Ocean's Fourteen</em>, though I would probably watch it if it was made.&nbsp; Watching three back-to-back <em>Ocean's</em> films is certainly a symptom of something wrong with my life, or perhaps just an extremely lazy approach to a Sunday.&nbsp; I ultimately enjoyed them all, cause they are fun movies - and three very different films, which must be credited to Soderbergh and his gang.&nbsp; Again you can see how the stars were just having fun here, loading the film up with inside jokes and sillyness, while adhereing to a plot that makes this an A-list version of that show <em>Leverage</em> that Tara likes.&nbsp; Being shot on video and with that weird aspect ratio, this felt more like a strange TV series to me.&nbsp; I started to think of these like Bond films, though I don't really know why.&nbsp; Between this and <em>Eleven</em>, I should say that I'm never quite sure what these films are supposed to be saying about Las Vegas - if they are supposed to be a criticism of the horrid vapid lifestyle there or some sort of ironic celebration.&nbsp; Anyway, my brain is too fried from 8 straight hours of film watching last night to really say any more about this, but I don't think this was ever meant to stimulate deep thoughts.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2009<br />Funny People<br />Judd Apatow, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Apatow's big new film overreaches somewhat, being 140 minutes long and attempting to tackle a heavy theme ('death') while actually failing to provide any insight into it.&nbsp; I like Apatow films enough, at least these major ones (that he directed) are worth seeing; and I knew that this would at least be funny in a way few other comedies actually are.&nbsp; I mean, compared to <em>The Hangover</em>, this was way funnier, even though <em>Hangover</em> had carte blanche to pile on nonsense, nonsequiturs and outrageous situations.&nbsp; So kudos for achieving more with some constraints.&nbsp; Still, this was the least funny of Apatow's sex-marraige-death trilogy, though it had some great moments (usually the best lines in these films tend to be zinger at the end of a scene rather than more subtle, pervasive humour).&nbsp; Casting Adam Sandler as himself, in a vulnerable role, is a great idea -- but it's already been done in <em>Punch Drunk Love</em>.&nbsp; This came off more like <em>JCVD</em>.&nbsp; Seth Rogen just feels so familiar now, and I do enjoy his performances (and Jonah Hill/Jason Schwatzmann were a good balancing act) but this felt a bit, I dunno, rote.&nbsp; Apatow totally pussies out and eliminates the actual death storyline about an hour before the film ends, leaving a really long and boring relationship drama to play out.&nbsp; This is really a film about celebrity or relationships or something; the message is a bit muddled because it's all been said so many times before.&nbsp; Apatow is often criticized for misogyny or at least the lack of adequate female characters; I wonder if he was aware of that when writing this because the jokes were all about balls and cocks.&nbsp; I guess this is also an interesting portrayal of the Adam Sandler character as some Freudian disaster, stuck in a development stage where he's completely obsessed with male genitalia. &nbsp; Leslie Mann isn't as annoying as she usually is and fulfills the female character void, getting a lot less screen time than Kathryn Heigl in<em> Knocked Up</em> yet seemingly much more complete. &nbsp; It was inspired to cast Eric Bana instead of Paul Rudd (or one of his regular roster); he's really good and gives the film a much needed jolt when it starts to lag in the third act.&nbsp; Also, too many celebrity cameos; we get the picture.&nbsp; At this point I think I feel like Apatow films are culturally significant enough to warrant watching even I don't actually like them; <em>40 Year Old Virgin</em> felt so fresh -- where a film manages to be funny and have a heartwarming, positive conclusion - but everything since has just been a retread; maybe Apatow needs to be a bit more ruthless.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 August 2009<br />Les carabiniers<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy, 1963<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>A weird Godard film for sure; a no-budget take on a war film, I guess, that is mostly poorly-photographed actors running around a muddy field.&nbsp; There's also some stock footage and a few memorable scenes (mostly the short soldier's experience in the cinemahouse) but I generally found this somewhat hard to enjoy.&nbsp; It's funny this was made right after the technicaly beautiful <em>Le M&eacute;pris</em> - it's still Raoul Coutard shooting it, though you could never tell.&nbsp; Maybe this was some sort of experiment or just screwing around for fun; I didn't really get much out of the dialogue and the long scene where they looked at postcards wasn't much fun either.&nbsp; It was cool to see Catherine Riberio, I guess.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 August 2009<br />Observe and Report<br />Jody Hill, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>As bad as this was, I think I sort of like Jody Hill's movies.&nbsp; Or rather, there's something secretly charming about them that make them guilty pleasures for me.&nbsp; <em>The Foot Fist Way</em> had a nice, episodic feel that happened through the editing and the general light tone; this had that too, though not quite as much.&nbsp; I mean, this movie is basically aimed at teenagers except there's too much swearing so it has to get an R rating.&nbsp; But it doesn't take itself seriously at all, so if you're looking for mindless diversions it's not so bad.&nbsp; I was thinking about how this and Danny McBride's character in <em>The Foot Fist Way</em> are both pathetic, delusional anti-heroes, and I started thinking about all of Elaine May's films and how her characters are like that too.&nbsp; I'm not suggesting Jody Hill has even a fraction of the talent that May has, but her films are definite predecessors to this type of humour.&nbsp; And while a lot of films like this are just mean-spirited, both May and Hill have sympathy and know how to play that for laughs too.&nbsp; Seth Rogen is fine though I'm starting to tire of him; it didn't take long for "Seth Rogen movie" to become a genre.&nbsp; Comedic actors in these films always start with small roles and gradually move closer to stardom, but I think as their screen time increases, their value diminishes.&nbsp; For example, Rogen moved from being a sideman to a star, and now I don't really care about him; the same could be said for Paul Rudd, or Danny McBride, and I can see it happening to Zach Galifianakis and Patton Oswalt.&nbsp; As Daron said in his review of <em>Funny People</em>, Aziz Ansari is next and whatever vehicle he stars in will probably be disappointing.&nbsp; As another example, <em>Tropic Thunder</em> may have been some sort of furthest logical conclusion to this model - a bunch of formerly funny comedic actors thrown into an overblown mess where they can all manage to be unfunny together, clearing the slate for some new blood.&nbsp; Once you arrive, it's over.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 August 2009<br />Crank 2: High Voltage<br />Mark Neveldine, Brian Taylor, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Though the film industry is hardly known for being fair to Asians, the ethnic stereotyping in this film is as blatantly racist as anything I have ever seen.&nbsp; The Mexican characters too are purely stereotyped, but at least their subtitles weren't in pidgin English.&nbsp; But then again, <em>Crank 2</em> is such a vile, nauseating picture with no trace of ethics, so I suppose the racism, sexism and homophobia is just part of the whole package.&nbsp; I actually enjoyed the first film because it was at least a kinetic, fun film that, while still somewhat revolting in its view, stayed light and fast.&nbsp; <em>Crank 2</em> is a mess in every possible way.&nbsp; The length of the film has ballooned and the once nimble sequences are now bogged down by bizarre attempts at sketch comedy that go nowhere and meaningless self-reference (such as the reference to the  <em>Transporter </em>franchise).&nbsp; The script seems to have been afflicted by a bad case of sequel-itis -- everything must be bigger, faster, and more explosive than the first film.&nbsp; Amy Smart's character, a rational balance in the first film despite her occasional objectification, is here nothing more than a sex toy.&nbsp; In fact, the public sex scene in the first film could at least be read as something she enjoys and takes power from, while in this film it's merely a pornographic joke. it felt like there were less clever action sequences and more gunfights here - senseless killing, which was in the first film, but here it was even more gratuitous.&nbsp; The utter stupidity of the script should also be commented on, though I suppose if you found <em>Crank 1</em> to be too plausible to enjoy, you might like this.&nbsp; There's also a few failed attempts at media satire that do nothing more than break up the film's momentum and make me lose my attention span.&nbsp; A film franchise that bases itself around attention defecit disorder cannot here even get through its own script without meaningless diversions. I could think of a few more things to pick apart here, but what's the point?&nbsp; <em>Crank 2</em> probably rivals <em>Wanted</em> in sheer reprehensibility, though <em>Wanted</em> suffered from unlikeable A-list actors while <em>Crank 2</em> gives you Corey Haim, David Carradine, Dwight Yoakam and the guy from Tool.&nbsp; You can take your pick here.&nbsp; I've been strangely fascinated by action movies over the past year or so, in particular because I've enjoyed Ruthless Reviews's series on 80s action films.&nbsp; And while 80s action films were extremely homoerotic mouthpieces for right-wing politics, at least they had a moral center.&nbsp; The contemporary approach strips meaning from violence, though the nipple slicing scene at least slowed the film down enough to genuinely make me uncomfortable (though I already saw it in <em>Ichi the Killer</em>, a film that I never stop thinking about when I watch these turds).&nbsp; After a week in the countryside participating in avant-garde art workshops, watching this was like hitting myself in the face with a 2x4 for two hours.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it was good to do this, to thrust me back into the 'real world' or if I just undid all the good from last week.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 August 2009<br />Bande &#224; part<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1964<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Gotta get back to the chronological Godard project after too much time away!&nbsp; And this was a nice easy fun film to come back to, especially as I had already seen it before so I could think about it now in the grand continuum of Godard's career to-date.&nbsp; This is one of the more memorable films of this period, as it's neo-Noirish style means it's at least tangentially related to <em>A Bout de Souffle</em> and the thriller style.&nbsp; This one is a lot more technically accomplished than <em>Les Carabiniers</em>, though with some slight absurd elements creeping in, which will be explored later.&nbsp; It's not that easy to see Godard's stylistic choices progressing in a linear manner - this actually had more in common with <em>Une femme est une femme</em> as that stuff goes than the few that immediately preceeded it.&nbsp; Maybe this is one of the grandfathers to the inept criminals genre ?&nbsp; Not that they are completely inept but the crime has a ramshackle feel and everything goes wrong, though they still get away with it and there's a 'happy' ending there with great great irony.&nbsp; I liked how the titles were done with the role in the middle of the person's name, and JLG's said "Jean-Luc Cinema Godard".&nbsp; I tried to imagine Sonic Youth's 'Kool Thing' during the dance scene, just like in <em>Simple Men</em>, but I couldn't keep that up with the frequent narration breaking in.&nbsp; Actually I loved the narrator - we see at the end that this was based on a novel, and you feel an authorial voice breaking in to say what characters were thinking, in a way that it hard to display with just images.&nbsp; A cop-out?&nbsp; I think JLG was experimenting with the use of narration, and maybe even directing his actors to feel completely differently than what was said.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 August 2009<br />Visioneers<br />Jared Drake, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I really liked <em>Visioneers</em>, even after it changed directions and became more of a indie romance than the strange absurd Dystopian comedy it began as.&nbsp; Though, it maintained a consistent absurdity even until the end, and was genuinely very, very funny in both the scenario and the little humorous asides stuck in.&nbsp; This is finally the film for Zach Galiafiankis, instead of crap like <em>The Hangover</em>.&nbsp; We actually get to see his range as a "real" actor, and he manages to carry blankness quite far, doing much more with it than a lot of other more celebrated actors.&nbsp; His usual comedic personality is completely absent here, and I appreciated this versatility, which I would have doubted he could pull off. I'd like to see more stuff by these guys.&nbsp; Though the themes were a fairly large scope for a first film, I think they could be capable of making something grander that is even more absurd, though their low-key pacing might be compromised by something more dense.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />27 August 2009<br />Adventureland<br />Greg Mottola, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The guy who directed <em>Superbad</em> made this, a big step towards "maturity" though really it's nothing more than a kid-trying-to-get-laid story masquerading as bittersweet coming of age.&nbsp; Maybe I'm being harsh towards it but I was really nonplussed by this and only watched it because it was shot in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; However, it wasn't even as good as <em>Wonder Boys</em>, because that was actualy filmed on my street while this was just scenes of Kennywood, but not even Kennywood as it should have looked in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like I have overcome my homesickness because about halfway through I wasn't even interested in seeing shots of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; However, the scenes of aimless driving around the city certainly struck a chord with me, even if it was set ten years before I spent my time behaving the same way.&nbsp; And weirdly, the characters in this film were listening to the same music that I was when I was their age, driving around.&nbsp; Mottola tried a little too hard to be hip and place the film in the correct milieu, going a bit overboard with the band posters in the bedrooms.&nbsp; But maybe this was his experience - I'm sure it was a lot of people's, even though I bet you'd have to survey a hell of a lot of Kennywood employees to find even one who listened to H&uuml;sker D&uuml;, let alone several.&nbsp; I can get into coming of age films (like <em>Breaking Away</em>) and it's nice this didn't resort to grossout humour, but I found the second-rate Michael Cera a little hard to connect with and felt that the whole story just was a high school soap opera.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 August 2009<br />Une femme mari&#xE9;e: Suite de fragments d&#x27;un film tourn&#xE9; en 1964<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1964<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I had never heard of this film before but it came up in the filmography so I gave it a chance, and I was really really surprised.&nbsp; This isn't a film that is particularly revolutionary in terms of style (though there is a lot of playing around with text and words on-screen) but rather a study of modern feminine existence.&nbsp; I realised while watching this how so many of Godard's films (if not all of them) have been about women, probing the relationships between men and women to varying degrees of suceess.&nbsp; This appears to be a film about a confident, assured woman making her own decisions about her life and her body, but it ends up exploring the role of the wife and internal, 'feminine' space (an idea that was beginning to get momentum in the feminist movement of the 1960's).&nbsp; I don't want to go as far as to call Godard a femnist filmmaker - I think his approach to sexuality is often problematic - but he was definitely trying to make films from a feminine perspective I think.&nbsp; This film is also the most erotic Godard film I have seen, for he recognizes that eroticism can come from intimacy rather than pornography.&nbsp; The sequences of Charlotte with her lovers have a real emotional charge, and the use of language/voiceover suggests more than it shows and is really effective.&nbsp; These scenes of shoulders, arms, and skin remind me of the similar scenes in <em>Hiroshima, Mon Amour</em> which was probably a big influence on Godard at this point.&nbsp; I don't think there are any strident viewpoints or easy answers here, nor is there any type of judgement made on Charlotte's life.&nbsp; The overheard scene of the two teenage girls talking about sex is interesting, as is the housekeeper's vulgar description of her sexuality - both are juxtaposed with Charlotte's elegant though technically 'improper' affair.&nbsp; Also I thought it was quite daring how Godard incorporated Holocaust themes into this film - during the long discussion about a half-hour in, a few weird jokes, and then the film that Charlotte and Robert see at the Orly cinema (is that <em>Night and Fog</em>?).&nbsp; In grad school we talked a lot about the role of Orly airport in French cinema (<em>La Jetee, Playtime</em>, etc.) and I wonder if it was chosen as some sort of symbol of flight.&nbsp; Anyway, this has been the nicest surprise of the Godard gauntlet so far; hopefully there will be more surprises down the road.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 August 2009<br />Hickey &#x26; Boggs<br />Robert Culp, USA, 1972<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Much thanks to Jon for recommending this, which I had never heard of despite a big interest in this type of 70's detective/cop film.&nbsp; This was pretty great.&nbsp; Bill Cosby is fantastic, and it's great to see him in a role where he has almost no comedic element - he was quite a versatile actor and plays Hickey perfectly.&nbsp; Robert Culp was a nice balance and their relationship was realistic without getting cute.&nbsp; This film was all plot and atmosphere; the plot became a bit confusing because I was letting myself be distracted by the general look of the 70's.&nbsp; Some great cars, and some even better 70's cop music here.&nbsp; A few shots really struck me, like the looming shadow of Culp's head in the bar when he goes back to talk Cosby into it.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 August 2009<br />Gake no ue no Ponyo<br />Hayao Miyazaki, Japan, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I wasn't particularly excited about watching this but I want to be dedicated to the PBT film club, so I gave it a go.&nbsp; I found myself struggling to stay awake for the first 20 minutes, though I appreciate hand-drawn animation (and how sad are the days when computer-generated has now become the norm?).&nbsp; But I think I was slowly won over to this.&nbsp; I like how the film really didn't make any sense, but it provided a beautiful world of adventure for the charaters to explore.&nbsp; I haven't watched an American kids film in ages but this felt so peaceful and surreal, and the opposite of what I imagine Western entertainment is.&nbsp; I don't know that i'm going to rush out and watch other Miyazaki films -- nor do I feel like I have anything really that insightful to say about it - but I'm glad Daron (or whomever picked it) made me watch it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 August 2009<br />In the Loop<br />Armando Iannucci, UK, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Though I expected this to be good, I was sort of blown away by it.&nbsp; I'm not surprised - I mean, Ianucci pretty much turns everything he touches to gold - but this went far beyond a mere witty political comedy.&nbsp; It's hard to make something to blatantly political, with no real attempt to disguise or metaphorise the content, and still succeed in being fresh.&nbsp; This was so incredibly, gut-busting hilarious that I didn't find it the slighest bit preachy.&nbsp; It's pessimistic, sure - and the ending is incredibly depressing despite how funny it is - but the misery of it didn't affect my enjoyment at all.&nbsp; I'm excited that Ianucci has made the leap to feature films and I'm curious to see where he'll go next.&nbsp; In the meantime, I think this will be endlessly rewatchable.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 September 2009<br />Alphaville, une &#233;trange aventure de Lemmy Caution<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy, 1965<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I think <em>Alphaville</em> was maybe the first Godard film I saw, years ago on a lousy VHS edition.&nbsp; This cheap DVD was sadly full-frame, though crisp, and with some nice extras.&nbsp; The documentary talked about the other Lemmy Caution films, which I was not aware of, and how for Godard to direct one was kind of like David Gordon Green directing <em>Pineapple Express</em> - or maybe Eddy Constantine was the Adam Sandler of his time, I dunno.&nbsp; Watching this again, it was a lot less weird than I remembered it being, and a lot less futuristic.&nbsp; The "future" setting was just Paris' most modern buildings, without any special effects; there are a lot of scenes where the focus appears to be on furniture or architectureal details rather than the characters.&nbsp; And while this is technically sci-fi, it's more of a film noir -- actually, it's really the best take on noir I've yet seen from Godard.&nbsp; Not necessarily the best of his noir-ish films, but the film that best plays with the genre and form of noir, ie: light and shadow.&nbsp; A few scenes in particular, like where Lemmy is talking with Dickson and the lighbulb is hanging, utilise contrast to set a really intense mood.&nbsp; The shots in negative don't really do much for me, though.&nbsp; In Colin MacCabe's filmed introduction, he says that he thinks this is Anna Karina's best performance in a Godard film, which is interesting because the role is so removed from being human.&nbsp; This was nearing the end of her time with Jean-Luc, yet he was still filming her and she was trying to give her best performance - these tensions may explain why she seems so believable in the role of a woman who is denied emotions (even if her attraction to Constantine is not believable).&nbsp; <em>Alphaville</em> is a film where the city is the star, and it rejects blatant surrealism (except perhaps for the swimming pool execution scene, or the long corrirdor with doors which surely influenced Lynch in a way).&nbsp; And while I love it, it's actually kind of boring and nothing happens.&nbsp; The long segments where Alpha 60 is talking seem to call attention to language, through the very slow speech and the drawn out poetry (even in a dystopian world without poetry).&nbsp; The dystopia of <em>Alphaville</em> is somewhat thin and the concept of illogical behavior feels underdeveloped and a bit easy, but I still think it would be a cool video game or RPG to inhabit.&nbsp; The French ultramodernism is quite different than the Italian, even though I found La D&eacute;fense to be one of the most striking places I've ever visited - I think the furniture and aesthetics in the few Elio Petri and Ferreri films I've watched have such a more palatable edge.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 September 2009<br />Pierrot le fou<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Italy, 1965<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I had to watch this again, even though it's only been a few months, as per the rules of my project, but I really enjoyed this the second time through.&nbsp; The first time I felt that this was such an explosive, exciting film that I missed the misery and pessimism undercutting it all.&nbsp; Now I see how Godard has almost deliberately referenced all of his past films.&nbsp; You get a little bit of everything here.&nbsp; The rebelliousness and betrayal of <em>Breathless</em>, the physical torture of <em>Le Petit Soldat</em>, the musical interludes of <em>Une femme est une femme</em>, the seaside/pastoral setting, lush colour cinematography and male/female disagreements of <em>Le M&eacute;pris</em>, the critique of militarism of <em>Les Carabiniers</em>, the cafe dancing of <em>Bande &aacute; part</em>, <em>Une femme mair&eacute;e</em>'s meditations upon advertising, and even the tension between language and emotion explored in <em>Alphaville</em>.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Additionally it looks ahead to the heavy politicisation of his later films, the car crashes of <em>Weekend</em>, the critique of consumer capitalism of <em>Masculin/feminine</em>.... so in some ways this really is the ultimate J-LG film.&nbsp; I guess this was pretty much the very end of things with Karina, so perhaps that's why her performance has such a venomous desperation.&nbsp; I did a blog post when I watched this a few months ago and apart from seeing this as deeply pessimistic now (apparently Godard's friends were worried he was going to commit suicide after seeing this) my thoughts still stand, only amplified.&nbsp; Amazing and essential -- and next is <em>Masculine/feminine</em> again, another favorite.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 September 2009<br />Masculin f&#233;minin: 15 faits pr&#233;cis<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Sweden, 1966<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Though most of Godard's films to date have been very concerned with communication between men and women, this film is his first to take it on so explicitly.&nbsp; And while i think this is a great, idea-packed film, it's a bit uneven.&nbsp; The first time through I found it dazzling but I think this time I saw it as a film trying to work out a new direction for its creator, with mixed results.&nbsp; I wonder if Godard, now that he had ended things with Anna Karina, was looking to these younger kids for some sort of inspiration, almost like a mid-life crisis (though he was probably only in his mid-30s at this point).&nbsp; It's clear that he was&nbsp; interested in the different pressures of politics, consumerism, intimacy/sexuality, and popular culture;&nbsp; this script was concocted to tease out some of these themes, I think. &nbsp; And it is certainly the dawning of a new era for J-LG: <em>Weekend</em> and <em>Tout va bien</em> are on the horizon.&nbsp; The best sections for me are the interrogative ones; the lengthy interviews with Chantal Goya's friends (who steal the picture from her a bit, I think) and the Q&amp;A voiceover during pr&eacute;cis #14, cleary a direct address from Godard to his audience.&nbsp; I wonder why he tacks on these weird, sudden endings to so many of his films (<em>Le m&eacute;pris, Vivre sa vie, </em>etc.) because it doesn't feel like he needs to challenge form or plot any more than he already does.&nbsp; Leaud is great and in a way I think he was a standin for Godard himself (despite being somewhat oafish and immature about things). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />12 September 2009<br />Made in U.S.A.<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1966<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>If the last two films signified a change in direction for Godard, then I'm going to have to accept that I am entering a much more difficult period in this sequence.&nbsp; <em>Made in USA</em> is obtuse and somewhat incomprehensible, though the subtitles in my copy were full of grammar and spelling errors, almost to the point of being Engrish.&nbsp; The French dialogue seemed unusual too and not always matched up with what was onscreen, so perhaps my entire experience of the film was coloured by this.&nbsp; But maybe not;&nbsp; the whole composition of the film seemed absurd and befuddling, as if Godard was out to dismantle cinema in yet another manner beyond what he had already done in the first 7 years of his career.&nbsp; Of course there are plenty of ideas in here, some grander than others.&nbsp; I didn't believe that the film was made in America for even one second, and it almost seems like as the film went on, there were more and more spatial errors (what's the location version of an anachronism called?) to emphasize the joke.&nbsp; <em>Made in USA</em> also managed to stay very cold despite its warm, bold colors - partially the effect of subverting film noir by shooting it in glorious Technicolour, and partially the result of the plot being so incoherent.&nbsp; Whenever the dead character's name was spoken, there was always some sort of obvious soundtrack intrusion, but I have no idea if this was supposed to signify anything or if it was just goofy.&nbsp; I figured that Godard's work from this period on would become increasingly more engaged with political debates, but the politics in this were as muddy as the plot. There were Communists and Fascists but I wasn't sure who was who, and if it mattered anyway.&nbsp; I have no idea what Jean-Pierre Leaud was doing in this film, but I guess I have no idea what anyone was doing in this film.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 September 2009<br />2 ou 3 choses que je sais d&#x27;elle<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1967<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's definitely true that the next stretch of Godard's (and possibly the rest of them) are going to be a bit difficult to make it through - not that there arent lots of ideas and whatnot, but there's nothing lively or accessible here.&nbsp; I was impressed by this ambitious (if uneven) dissection of consumerism and urbanism here, though I'm not sure what I took away from it.&nbsp; This is where Raoul Coutard shines - the cinematography has a distinct vision that gloriously renders construction sites and ultramodern architecture in a strange, carefully chosen palette - as opposed to the bold warm colors of <em>Made in USA</em>.&nbsp; The visual experimentation during the whispering voiceovers (such as the cup of coffee or the burning cigarette) are perhaps a bit amateurish compared to the experimental film masters but I thought they were a good, psychedelic intrusion into the otherwise didactic film.&nbsp; The narrative elements, such as the lead character's role as a prostitute, never caught enough fire to hold my interest - was this a remake of <em>Vivre sa vie</em> to some extent?&nbsp; But the monologues (because really, this film was just a series of monologues hung on a very loose plot with some impressive photography) never lost me (except for maybe the stuff at the end about language, which was particularly scattered in a film already chock full of scattered ideas).&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 September 2009<br />La chinoise<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1967<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Another somewhat painful and wordy mess of a film, my bootleg copy of <em>La Chinoise</em> also suffered from incomplete/erroneous subtitles (as was the case with <em>Made in USA</em>) though I was able to undestand enough of the dialogue to follow it. Not that there was much to follow.&nbsp; Godard's embrace of left-wing politics is all the more weird now that I'm reading a book about him and I know that he was quite right-wing until the mid-60s.&nbsp; Maybe the contradictions and endless discussions in this filme were his attempt to reconcile his past, which is about the only personal remnant of him that I could detect.&nbsp; Well, that and the cultural emphasis on Marxism explored by the characters, who even though they are played by awesome actors and actresses (Leaud, Berto, the girl from <em>Au Hazard Balthasar</em>).&nbsp; This Chinese DVD rip has very washed out colours and muted tones despite the bold visual design.&nbsp; One of the main reasons I started this Godard education was to understand how his sense of form developed througout his work, though I've come to see formlessness as his form, especially in this case.&nbsp; I know Luke Fowler regards <em>La Chinoise</em> very highly but maybe that's cause his mother raised him on a diet of left-wing ideas; I found it turgid and dull, and I know that if i stick with my program the next fifteen films are all going to be like this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 September 2009<br />Week End<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Italy / France, 1967<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I saw <em>Week End</em> years ago, apparently in the pre-PBT days, and was really disappointed by it.&nbsp; I had read about it a lot, understanding it to be a classic of surrealist cinema, but for some reason I didn't enjoy it much.&nbsp; Watching it now, at the end of the first stay of the Godard gauntlet, I loved it.&nbsp; Maybe the slow pace got me - I mean, this contains the greatest car crash sequence in cinema history, though it takes nine minutes and is kind of boring.&nbsp; This film is so full of anger and contempt for humanity that it's a bit much to take.&nbsp; The lead actors (supposedly hoisted upon J-LG by the studio) are portrayed as horrible, amoral people and they are raped and cannibilised almost without comment.&nbsp; The crazy feral revolutionaries at the end are the only characters portrayed with any sympathy at all.&nbsp; And while there is a lot of humour, it's painful humour, unlike a similarly anti-society film as <em>Themroc</em>.&nbsp; But where <em>Themroc</em> seems to rail against civilised society, <em>Week End</em> feels like it is a satirical lance through the rotten sores created by bourgois' society's sins.&nbsp; I found this infinitely more enjoyable than <em>La Chinoise</em> and I totally don't know what was wrong with me 9 years ago.&nbsp; Of course, I can probably say I understand Godard's style more since I've now seen every film of his that anyone ever talks about (and I'm about to enter the extremely difficult phase two, which I may not make it out alive from).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 September 2009<br />Le gai savoir<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / West Germany, 1969<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Post-<em>Week End</em> Godard is a scary prospect, as I expected a series of agit-prop films so totally focused on the leftist politics that all traces of art (and fun) are removed.&nbsp; <em>Le Gai Savoir</em> was so awesome that I'm no longer scared, though I suspect this was the genesis of Godard's artistic reboot and the dull agit-prop is to follow.&nbsp; This is a very experimental film, originally made for television, consisting almost entirely of dialogue between Juliet Berto and Jean-Pierre Leaud on a dark soundstage under assumed names.&nbsp; No other indicators of character, narrative or setting are ever present.&nbsp; Their discussion is intercut both visually and aurally with detourned advertising and cartoon imagery (with ironic and provocative saying written on in an elegant cursive) as well as radio/television sounds and occasionally Godard's gasping narration.&nbsp; The film asks a million questions, but is primarily concerned with the elements of film: sound, image, language.&nbsp; And while the specter of politics looms over everything (with several sections about the role of the avant-garde in revolution, labour, etc.) it's balanced well by the more formal explorations.&nbsp; I love the 'essay film' and this is a fantastic example, though it feels unfocused because essay films are usually tightly constructed with a strong thesis.&nbsp; This isn't concerned with making any arguments, but merely experimenting with ideas and being provocative.&nbsp; It actually resembles <em>La Chinoise</em> except I found the discussions more engaging (even when they were broken up like a surrealist collage) and the absence of a plot or characters preferable to a weak plot.&nbsp; There's a few passages that were hard to make it through (such as a long spoken/collage bit during the third act over a black screen) but I hung in there and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; I dont know that there's any ideas in here that really shocked me or will alter my own approach to sound, art, film, or language but I still found it as intellectually engaging as anything else I've seen by Godard (if stylistically minimal).&nbsp; The revolution for Godard began as a personal revolution and this is clearly on display here -- it feels almost like he was stopping and re-evaluating eveything after <em>Week End</em> and trying to start over.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 October 2009<br />Un film comme les autres<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Gorin, France, 1968<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Une film comme les autres</em> is truly one of the most unbearable things I have ever subjected myself to.&nbsp; And to be fair, I only really paid attention for the first ten minutes before completely daydreaming and eventually reading something else while it was playing in front of me, so maybe I can't even list this with complete honesty.&nbsp; This film is a conversation between several students sitting in a field that lasts for an hour, occasionally intercut with footage from Paris in May '68 during the riots.&nbsp; The footage of the students is shot weird, so you can't see anyone's faces, and the dialogue is overdubbed in English, but all by the same dubber, and not at a loud enough volume to drown out the French.&nbsp; Then, the whole film repeats with a different soundtrack.&nbsp; Apparently this was only shown once in public and the audience was so angry they tore the seats out of the theatre - I can't blame them.&nbsp; The soundtrack makes this film completely incomprehensible - even if I could clearly hear what was being said (which isn't due to the bootleg quality of this) it would still be delivered by a mumbling, monotone British guy.&nbsp; (The English layer was in the original film).&nbsp; I don't know what Jean-Luc was thinking if he was trying to be stridently political at this time - he obfuscates whatever message might have been there through this mangled soundtrack and irrelevant imagery.&nbsp; The one redeeming feature is seeing some of the Paris '68 footage, but it's incoherent in this context and there are certainly better documents out there.&nbsp; This hopefully will be the worst of the agit-prop period but who knows - it could get worse.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 October 2009<br />Sympathy for the Devil<br />Jean-Luc Godard, UK, 1968<br />Location: TV area <br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I should note that I actually watched <em>One Plus One</em>, which is the proper/correct cut of the film, and not <em>Sympathy for the Devil</em> which was edited against Godard's will (but is unfortunately the only version IMDB lists).&nbsp; I suspect this is the only film between <em>Week End</em> and <em>Tout Va Bien</em> with any commercial appeal whatsoever, and if it wasn't for half the film being the Stones writing 'Sympathy for the Devil' it probably wouldn't have the little appeal it does.&nbsp; Because I like the Stones, and found it fascinating to watch them in the studio, I found this to be really fun.&nbsp; The other parts of the film are wrapped up in radical politics as incoherently as I've come to expect from J-LG, but quirky and interesting anyway.&nbsp; The whole film uses really long tracking shots, like ten minutes in length, which shows Godard's constant quest for technical innovation in his film.&nbsp; That's not something I picked up on from watching all of these but rather from the book I'm reading - he was always trying different film stocks and other sorts of techniques, and later gets way into video w/Anne-Marie Mi&eacute;ville.&nbsp; The two contrasting films comment on each other, particularly on sexuality and race as the exaggerated black power scenes made me think about the Stones' exploitation of blues forms for capitalist success.&nbsp; Somehow I'm surprised it took me so long to see this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 October 2009<br />Fantastic Mr. Fox<br />Wes Anderson, USA / UK, 2009<br />Location: UCG Renfrew Street, Glasgow<br />Format: 35mm film in cinema<br />Company: Adam Rusbridge<br /><p>I loved every second of this and I can't wait to see it again.&nbsp; Of course, a quick perusal of my Wes Anderson watching comments over the PBT years will prove that Anderson is pretty much beyond criticism for me.&nbsp; If I try to view this subjectively, I'd still probably say that this was an incredibly awesome film. I don't frequently watch films targeted at younger audiences, though I think most children would find this to be too weird and boring.&nbsp; Really, this was a Wes Anderson film in every way, and the stop-motion animation carried through the weird mannerisms and nuances that bring so much humour to his films.&nbsp; The visual style was stunning; the colours were beautifully autumnal and working in animation, he was able to pack the screen with the obsessive details and quirks that make his films so totally encompassing.&nbsp; I loved this and don't even think I'm going to say much more here until I see it a second time.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 November 2009<br />Whatever Works<br />Woody Allen, USA / France, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'll take Larry David in anything - really, anything -- but even his comedic gifts were not enough for me to enjoy this turd.&nbsp; Honestly, I don't know Woody Allen keeps making films because this was so bad it was actually depressing.&nbsp; Were these terrible, awkward caricatures actually supposed to represent his view of people in the world today?&nbsp; Has he ever met anyone from outside of NYC?&nbsp; There were a few comedic barbs that hinted at his gift, as seen in his classics, but this was just a retread with LD instead of Woody in the lead role.&nbsp; And instead of any of the character undergoing any meaningful, non-cartoonish growth or change, we just get a pile of pop-philosophy bullshit hidden behidn the cheapest of metafictional screens.&nbsp; I could have just watched some of the older seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm instead of this, and in addition to LD hitting the mark more, there's probably a lot more depth in David's obsessions and observations than in Allen's these days.&nbsp; I can't even imagine how limp this would be without LD in it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />17 November 2009<br />Southland Tales<br />Richard Kelly, Germany / USA / France, 2006<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara, Peter Burr<br /><p>We started watching this around 1 AM which is a pretty nuts thing to do in itself, but everyone lasted through it all.&nbsp; Peter, afterwards, thought it was mostly a 'bad' film and that <em>Donnie Darko</em> was somehow superior, but after we talked about it more (and he went to sleep thinking about it obsesively), by the morning he had come around to see the genius of it.&nbsp; The one thing that struck me the most on my third viewing was how completely in control R. Kelly (as I will now refer to him) was in the making of <em>Southland Tales</em>.&nbsp; This was a guy who knew exactly what he was doing at every stage of the film, and he made the film exactly the way he wanted to, with one of the most complete cinematic visions I have ever seen (which is why I put this in the same category with my favorite films by Greenaway, Tarkovsky, and Lynch, though I can't put Kelly's entire career on that level).&nbsp; That's not to say that there aren't elements of the film that are 'bad' art -- perhaps a better term would be awkwards and amateurish - such as the poetry readings, the attempts at humour, and some elements of the parody and satire.&nbsp; But they were completely part of his vision, which is a very transformative film - I think Shaviro calls it post-cinematic because of the way it deals with the flow of images/media and sound.&nbsp; Perhaps its wrong to view this as really satire or parody because it's commenting on our media-saturated world through media itself, and thus it's something entirely different.&nbsp; The 'meta'/pomo elements are an easy way to enjoy (or dismiss) the film, or they could be seen as a copout for R. Kelly - instead of constructing a cohesive critique that attends to proper dramatic constructs, he can hide behind the levels of meta.&nbsp; But actually I think that instead of a copout, <em>Southland Tales</em> really demands that the viewer confront these issues - the balance of A-list/B-list actors for one thing is quite clever, such as the way that the A-listers are fairly talentless to begin with (the Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timberlake) and given characters that are thick and awkward -- whereas the army of great character actors and B-listers (John Larroquette, Nora Dunn, Jon Lovitz, etc.) are given more room to shine.&nbsp; But its more than just clever.&nbsp; It's really relentless.&nbsp; The first hour of this film is so goddam dense that it feels like two hours - and that's before it really gets weird.&nbsp; It demands so much from the viewer, but instead of being merely intelligent, it cuts its intelligence with the standard tropes of the Hollywood sci-fi/epic film (weird characterisations/stereotypes, goofy humour, etc.) which I think bisects the 'intellectual'/'mainstream' divide so evenly that there's almost no audience left.&nbsp; I wonder if this film will be forgotten (maybe it already has been) or if twenty years from now, we'll look back on it as the phenomenal achievement that it is.&nbsp; The parameters by which we assess and consume media have changed so much that's it silly to forecast this.&nbsp; I don't even care about unraveling the plot, though that's a lot of fun too - it's the toality of the vision that affects me now.&nbsp; This was not the director's cut, by the way.&nbsp; It would be really interesting to construct an essay about this film and all of the PK Dick novels I read, but I'd have to think of a really good purpose to it - what is the significance of these gonzo narratives/reality?&nbsp; There's more to it than mere experimentation with literary forms, and I think this film gets close to another level through all of its videoscreens and corporate media takeoffs.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 November 2009<br />Food, Inc.<br />Robert Kenner, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox, and on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm interested in the politics of food in America, but I didn't learn anything from this film (which Tara predicted - she suggested that I not waste my time with it).&nbsp; This was slightly all over the place, like a survey of various topics relating to industrial food.&nbsp; There was nice cinematography and some snazzy graphics, but nothing too groundbreaking - just what you'd expect.&nbsp; Michael Pollan was present and there was some gross shots of chicken pens, and probably the most worthwhile stuff was about how food corporations persecute farmers and even critics of their policies.&nbsp; Plus there was an emotional Michael Moore-kinda vibe with the woman who's son died of e-coli poisoning. &nbsp; Overall I'd say that the time it takes to watch this could be better spent reading a Michael Pollan book, or even watching the low-budget but far, far better <em>King Corn</em>.&nbsp; Still, this makes me glad I don't live in America and reminds me how careful I'm going to have to be when I'm back for Xmas to avoid eating all this bullshit.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 November 2009<br />British Sounds<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Henri Roger, UK, 1970<br />Location: TV area and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox, and on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's tough to get back into the chronological Godard project as my few weeks in the UK broke it up -- and being that I'm mired in the Dziga Vertov group era, it's a bit intimidating to dive back in.&nbsp; <em>British Sounds</em> feels like an appropriate re-entry point given that I was just in London.&nbsp; And as these things go, it was pretty good.&nbsp; The title is apt, as this further explores some of the questions asked in <em>Le Gai Savoir</em> about the relationship between image and sound in cinema, though with a very British-specific narration about class struggles and Marxism and all the things that were raging in 1969. Obviously I found this somewhat more accessible because it was in English, but it was also stylistically well-made.&nbsp; These Dziga Vertov films <em>are</em> propaganda, but Godard and Gorin were at least trying to do something artistic with the form.&nbsp; There's a lot of Godard's handwriting and some editing that, while pretty basic, is effective - especially when the right-wing guy is giving his speech about minorities and workers, and they keep cutting to scenes of those people.&nbsp; The nude woman wandering up and down the stairs is exploitative, but of course the voiceover text discusses that, which reminds me of the way David Lynch asks questions about the problematic usage of women's bodies in cinema.&nbsp; It's a bit funny now to watch these films during in the dying throes of late capitalism, but I guess that's part of the nature of this project.&nbsp; This was about as 'fun' as an experimental Marxist agit-prop piece can be - I might have even enjoyed it more than <em>One Plus One</em> or at least put it on the same level.&nbsp; This was a bit short and probably falls under the self-imposed 'feature length' rule I have for listing films here, but since I bothered to watch it, it's getting listed.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 November 2009<br />Stephen Tobolowsky&#x27;s Birthday Party<br />Robert Brinkmann, USA, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Now that I've listened to all of the Joe Frank <em>The Other Side</em> episodes featuring Larry Block, I have a serious lack of brilliant stories from bald character actors in my life.&nbsp; I was overjoyed to discover the new Stephen Tobolowski podcasts, which don't even come close to the majesty of Joe and Larry but are entertaining to listen to when I am washing dishes.&nbsp; This is the indie film that inspired the podcasts, whcih follows Tobolowski through 90 minutes of storytelling during his birthday.&nbsp; It's simple and sweet, and of course recalls films like  <em>Swimming to Cambodia </em>or <em>My Dinner with Andre</em>, though maybe not up to the same level.&nbsp; It is enjoyable and I didn't get bored with the relatively static scene composition -- if anything bored me, it's Tobolowski's very 'classic' storytelling style, with cliches and exaggerations that are a tad bit annoying.&nbsp; You could probably look at this as a film that plays on the duality of an actor and a storyteller - is he really telling true stories?&nbsp; Is he playing yet another character?&nbsp; But I don't think that's the point.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />27 November 2009<br />Let&#x27;s Go to Prison<br />Bob Odenkirk, USA, 2006<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>I expected the worst here, but I found this strangely pleasant.&nbsp; I think Bob Odenkirk may have a better track record on feature-length films than, say, David Wain; though this was nothing I'd watch again, it certainly surprised me by being dark enough yet still in the boundaries of 'easy' comedy.&nbsp; It's good that they didn't downplay the white supremacy or the rape, and there's actually some honest horror about the brutality of the prison system even if they glossed over it a bit.&nbsp; Plus, you can see Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim in a cameo on the very last scene.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 November 2009<br />Pravda<br />Jean-Luc Godard, West Germany / France, 1970<br />Location: TV area and studio<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox, and on Macbook w/monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>Back in my senior year of undergrad, Colin MacCabe (who was teaching a class on James Joyce) made a reference to this film, specifically how the Czech workers are not subtitled, instead telling the audience 'If you don't understand Czech, you better start learning".&nbsp; So I've always been a bit more curious about this than the other Godard/Gorin collaborations in the Dziga Vertov group.&nbsp; <em>Pravda</em> again surprised me, coming off as a more nuanced essay film that analysed the failure of the Soviet Union's 'really existing socialism', which they continually call revisionism.&nbsp; It's a bit muddled and confused, and 'Westernism' is rejected as well, with Mao presented, at the end, as some sort of answer for the Czech people.&nbsp; This works as a twisted travel diary of Czechoslovakia in 1969, with footage shot on 16mm and embellished by the Dziga Vertov Group's trademark handwriting and collages.&nbsp; The main dialogue is between a male character, Vladimir, and a female named Rosa, who I assume we will revisit in <em>Vladimir et Rosa</em>.&nbsp; Though this one of the most dismissed of these films, i really enjoyed it so maybe I'm a sucker for Marxist-Leninist cinema.&nbsp; I think the criticism and search for new forms of organisation and education is what I liked about it - it surprised me by not being a massive slab of dogma.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 November 2009<br />Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y<br />Johan Grimonprez, Belgium, 1998<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>With an aesthetic that feels like a cross between a Craig Baldwin film and an Adam Curtis TV documentary, <em>Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y</em> is a stunning meditation on airline hijacking and terrorism.&nbsp; These days, this style of ironic footage and sound (this film uses mostly disco music behind the action) is old hat, but puting that aside, I think this is a remarkable work of non-fiction film and probably the defining pre-9/11 statement on terrorism from a provocative, artistic perspective.&nbsp; Grimonperez eschews narration except for voiceovers reading from what sound to me like Don DeLillo texts, using captions to present the history of hijacking and terrorism.&nbsp; It doesn't proceed chronologcally but thematically, and whenever I'm afraid it's about to turn into a mess, it snaps back into focus with a lucid coherence.&nbsp; Even in this age of oversaturated videopresence, some of the footage here is astounding.&nbsp; After 9/11, Grimonperez published <em>InFlight</em>, a fake inflight magazine about hijacking that is an equally monumental achievement, at least to me.&nbsp; Why I waited so long to see this, i don't know.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 November 2009<br />Children of Men<br />Alfonso Cuar&#243;n, Japan / UK / USA, 2006<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Children of Men</em> was a phenomenal dystopian sci-fi/thriller.&nbsp; This is the type of film that's perfect for Clive Owen, and it was made without any mistakes or excess, for the most part.&nbsp; It pulled no punches, and a few of the scenes (such as the backwards driving part in Cantebury, or the ending warscene) were among the most suspenseful and thrilling action sequences I've seen since <em>The Hurt Locker</em>.&nbsp; I watched this because most people on a "top 10 sci-fi films of the past decade' put this at #1, and I can see why.&nbsp; I don't have any deep criticism here, since it's 1:40 AM and I'm feeling kind of dumb from watching this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 December 2009<br />Extract<br />Mike Judge, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara for first half-hour<br /><p>What a turd.&nbsp; I don't understand why Mike Judge is so revered when <em>Idiocracy</em> is his funniest film and it's only slightly above average.&nbsp; This seemed incredible paint-by-numbers except without even an entertaining amount of conflict.&nbsp; Everything works out so easily for Jason Bateman that I'm wondering what the whole point was.&nbsp; I didn't laugh much; I'd explain my attitude as 'tolerant' because this film was just mediocre, not even offensive in any way (which at least gets me fired up about something).&nbsp; When the David Koechner character is the highlight of the film, you know you're in for a long 90 minutes.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 December 2009<br />Double Take<br />Johan Grimonprez, Belgium / Germany / Netherlands, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I downloaded this, which was the only other (available) film work by Johan Grimonprez, on the strength of <em>Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y</em>.&nbsp; This was a film that seemed far different in approach and subject matter at first, though it revealed itself to gradually become a similar reexamination of history and conflict.&nbsp; The screenplay was written by Tom McCarthy, who wrote the fantastic novel <em>Remainder</em>, and it followed the story of Alfred Hitchcock, at the premier of <em>The Birds</em>, meeting his future self from 1980.&nbsp; This is sort of a documentary and sort of a fictional film, and also another pile of collage similar to Adam Curtis or <em>Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y </em>-- but it was somehow more than the sum of all of its parts.&nbsp; Grimonprez uses the cold war events leading up to the Kennedy assassination as a parallel text to the Hitchcock double story, simultaneously commenting on it and being commented upon.&nbsp; I can't help but recalled <em>Mad Men</em>, specifically because they have just covered the same period, and also because they both play with the idea of a double life and illusion.&nbsp; The footage of Hitchcock is everywhere and it's great - the director, as character, is not explored as a human being but rather as a symbol, that of a creator/artist.&nbsp; As the film hurtles towards the Cuban Missile Crisis and the opening of <em>The Birds</em>, it really starts to gel.&nbsp; I should also say that the found/recycled footage is used masterfully.&nbsp; This is one of the few feature length experimental films that I would recommend to a wide audience of people; I'm going to revise my top films of the year list now to include <em>Double Take</em>, because I was pretty much blown away by it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />9 December 2009<br />Inglourious Basterds<br />Quentin Tarantino, USA / Germany / France, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Is Brad Pitt supposed to be a great actor or do people just like him for being a one-dimensional cartoon?&nbsp; This was probably the best Quentin Tarantino movie I've ever seen, but that isn't saying a whole lot.&nbsp; I really enjoyed this, but it could have been a half-hour shorter.&nbsp; For all the parts that annoyed me though, there were some really gripping moments; generally anytime Christopher Waltz was on-screen, the scene was completely suspenseful and painful (but in a good way).&nbsp; As revenge fantasies go, this was surely satisfying, and the plot was pretty well-constructed, but Tarantino could learn a few things about subtlety.&nbsp; But then again, this is a guy who ranked "Fridays", "Unbreakable" and "Shaun of the Dead" in his 20 favourite films since 1992 so I guess I shouldn't expect much.&nbsp; Brad Pitt seemed to take his character straight out of a recent Coen brothers movie and when Mike Myers was on screen the film lost any credibility it might have had with me.&nbsp; But maybe this is the (ha, ha) "mature" period of Tarantino we're entering.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 December 2009<br />Le vent d&#x27;est<br />Groupe Dziga Vertov, Italy / France / West Germany, 1970<br />Location: TV areas<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Another entry in the Dziga Vertov Group period and this is more of the same, pretty much - a 90 minute exploration of politics, labour, the role of cinema, and history.&nbsp; This had less handwritten titles and interjected artbits, but more staged/dramatic scenes.&nbsp; One complaint is that the action on screen often bore no relation to the narration, but I guess that's to be expected.&nbsp; It's not really fair for me to call these films 'propaganda' films because they are so much more than that -- if anything, they are a reinvention of the political/didactic film, with the usual rules torn down in the same way as Godard did with every other genre.&nbsp; The "wind from the East" here isn't really discussed til the very end, and I suppose this represents Mao, because in this (and <em>Pravda</em>)<em>, </em>J-LG and Gorin have made their views of Sovietism quite clear.&nbsp; There was a section about halfway through where they recalled men and women in historical situations who had somehow compromised or sold out their values, and that seemed to indicate something suspicious at the time, particularly as these scenes had Anna Wiezmesky, J-LG's wife at the time who disagreed with him politically.&nbsp; The staged Western was incoherent, and this (at times) fell into the same problem as <em>Une Film Commes les Autres</em> which is that it was just endless shots of people sitting in the grass with voiceover.&nbsp; At least the narration here was intelligible (and intelligent), almsot as if Godard and Gorin had reached some compromise between radical formal elements and radical content.&nbsp; Still, I could detect some unrest here -- well, the narration is nothing but unrest, but I mean formally -- and overall the film was tough going unless you're in the mood to think about struggle and conflict from 40 years ago.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 December 2009<br />The Candidate<br />Michael Ritchie, USA, 1972<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is like an inverted <em>Bob Roberts</em>, except a generation earlier and without any trace of satire .... or is it?&nbsp; Because I found the first 1/3 of this film to be almost sickeningly idealistic, like a total heroic wet dream for Obama people and clearly the inspiration that Plouffe and Axelrod took for their own machinations ... but then it started to change.&nbsp; I think I ended up with a real appreciation for this film because of the way it slowly worked ruination into the hero and had lots of tiny, subtle details.&nbsp; Of course Peter Boyle is always a pleasure (even when he's hiding behind a beard) and Allen Garfield is a favorite too.&nbsp; This is actually a deeply cynical film about politics, perhaps all the moreso cynical because it doesn't bash you over the head with it.&nbsp; Something like <em>Bob Roberts</em> is more overtly parodic but this really cuts through the marrow, especially after what's happened to all of the Hope that was manufactured last year.&nbsp; Don Porter's Republican senator is thin and one-dimensional, but I do like how little the GOP's message has changed since 1972.&nbsp; Maybe it's just because I'm a fan of all films from this period but I was perhaps struck my how effective it's approach to satire was - no absurdity, nothing ridiculous - just the cold dismantling of dreams.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 December 2009<br />Lotte in Italia<br />Groupe Dziga Vertov, Italy / France, 1971<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Laura Hill for half<br /><p>Another day, another Dziga Vertov Group film.&nbsp; This one was watched as a 'break' from writing a paper, and it was pretty much what I expected.&nbsp; I think one of the reasons I've been surviving these films is because I really love the style that they are made in.&nbsp; Even though the ideas become confusing and somewhat circular, I think I'm such a fan of the essay film form that I hang in there.&nbsp; This was obviously made in Italy and generally concerns one woman's "struggles", at least her struggle against bourgeosie culture, the state, and her own self-identity.&nbsp; The first part of the film does the usual exploration of the conflicts inherent in these things, but at no point does it really discuss what the idea of progress is supposed to be.&nbsp; For a film that is so much about struggle, I don't think the goal is ever clear.&nbsp; Or perhaps that is Godard and Gorin's point -- certainly, by this point the Dziga Vertov films have gone far beyond any sort of polemical belief structure and are extremely self-questioning.&nbsp; <em>Luttes in Italie</em> really takes a dive into the postmodern with the final part of the film, where the woman is discussing the earlier parts of the film and how her attitude has changed.&nbsp; I watched this in one sitting which was maybe a bad idea, because by the end I was having trouble following what she was talking about, when referring to the second or first part of the film and then showing footage a second time with commentary -- additionally, the dialogue was primarily Italian with French spoken overtop, and then English subtitles for both when necessary so the whole sensation was slightly disorientating.&nbsp; Which again is probably somewhat intentional, at least with the dual Italian/French soundtracks.&nbsp; The black screens throughout (and the discussion of what they mean) go back to Godard's own struggle to determine how image and sound work together to create meaning, which is the underlying non-political current through all of these films.&nbsp; Or maybe it is political, because everything is political, certainly the formal construction of a piece of cinema about politics.&nbsp; There were even less drawings and handwritten shots than in <em>Vent d'Est</em>, which is a shame because I really like that stuff from a purely aesthetic/collage point of view.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 December 2009<br />Martyrs<br />Pascal Laugier, France / Canada, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This horror film didn't shy away from utter brutality, which is good because I hate horror movies that fail to be horrifying.&nbsp; The first 1/3 was a relatively traditional bloodbath that didn't do much for me, though I noticed how the film seemed to move in its own weird rhythm that I couldn't quite figure out.&nbsp; The middle section was the best of the many key changes, and for awhile I felt really truly uncomfortable.&nbsp; When it descended into long fade-in/fade-out repetitive scenes of torture, I started to become bored.&nbsp; Usually I love a film in which a sexy French-Canadian is force-fed tarka dhal, but every scene here felt unnecessary and tacked on.&nbsp; When the whole film took a turn towards metaphysical bullshit, it really lost me, though it was nice how they managed to use the iTunes visualiser.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 December 2009<br />Secrecy<br />Peter Galison, Robb Moss, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>i should declare a moratorium on watching these types of documentaries - films that cry out against the crimes and abuse of the Bush administration, specifically in regards to the war on terror. It's not that I'm not interested anymore - I certainly feel that since the last 8 years were American's all-time moral low point, it's a ripe topic for filmmaking - but they get pretty repetitive.&nbsp; Having said that, I did think this was one of the better entries in the canon, as it focused specifically on the use of the state secrets clause in the supposed interest of "national security".&nbsp; It's not entirely based around the war on terror, investigating the Supreme Court case from 60 years ago that started the privilege, and also presenting some viewpoints from pro-secrecy advocates without mocking them.&nbsp; It was pretty standard in terms of style, which is nice because overly stylised documentaries annoy me these days.&nbsp; I particularly liked how they included footage from contemporary artworks that commented on terrorism and information control - it was a classy touch, particularly as it was used to somewhat structure the documentary.&nbsp; Though I would file this alongside <em>Taxi to the Dark Side</em>, <em>Standard Operating Procedure</em>, <em>Why We Fight</em>, etc, it actually strikes a good chord and distinguishes itself from the rest of these.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 December 2009<br />Vladimir et Rosa<br />Groupe Dziga Vertov, France / West Germany, 1970<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is pretty much the end of the line for the Dziga Vertov group, apart from <em>Tout va Bien</em> which is under their own names again, and I was really pleasantly surprised by this.&nbsp; It's almost like the hardline, doctrinair politics of the last 4 films were ready to explode here in a return to fictional filmmaking (sort of).&nbsp; This is a weird, warped telling of the Chicago 8 trial, except the characters are all different, everything is moved to France, and it's actually like you'd expect a Godard film to be.&nbsp; Godard and Gorin themselves play Vladimir and Rosa, and appear throughout the film in ridiculous, abusrd situations that provoke questions about the role of a filmmaker or director.&nbsp; The scenes of them walking through the tennis court babbling are hilarious and brilliant too -- and their interactions with the other members of the Chicago 8 are pretty funny too.&nbsp; The revolutionaries are portrayed with mixed feelings, which is the logical place to be if you've paid any attention to the last few films.&nbsp; Clearly the filmmaker's engagement with leftist politics ultimately led him into circles, chasing his own tail, which is reflected in the often contradictory, confused monologues of Yves and Juliet.&nbsp; But because this is somewhat based on dramaturgy again, I found it as enjoyable as any of the 60s films leading up to this - and really not different at all from <em>La Chinoise</em> in it's construct. This is by far the finest of the Dziga Vertov films and it probably deserves a place in the Godard canon as much as <em>Two or Three Things</em> or<em> </em>even <em>Week End</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 December 2009<br />Revolver<br />Guy Ritchie, UK, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I don't think I've ever seen any of Guy Ritchie's stuff before but I was pleasantly surprised by this, a crime/gangster/con movie that managed to keep evading its own logic and weave a crazy nest of confusion.&nbsp; I'm always a fan of films that have to be somewhat unraveled, and this certainly makes these kind of films more interesting.&nbsp; The gun violence here didn't really bother me because the film had something to it besides mindless glorification, even if I'm not sure that it adds up to much more beyond enterainment at a slightly higher level than the usual Jason Statham movie.&nbsp; But that was good enough for me, as I was looking for something fun after all the Godard and this was fun without being completely mindless.&nbsp; Some of the scenes where Statham or Liotta were babbling different perpsectives at the same time were quite intense, in a wonderfully paranoid <em>Parallax View</em> sort of manner. The pluralism of viewpoints wasn't <em>Ulysses</em>, and Ray Liotta is still a shitty actor but Andr&eacute; 3000 was pretty fun, so I give this a thumbs up.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 December 2009<br />I Love You, Man<br />John Hamburg, USA, 2009<br />Location: KLM flight from AMS to JFK<br />Format: airplane video screen<br />Company: KLM flight 6169<br /><p>John Hamburg's mediocre comedies are a cut above the rest, I think -- though I still never watched half of them.&nbsp; I said that I was hoping there'd be a Paul Rudd film on the plane that I could watch, and there was.&nbsp; I definitely enjoyed this, at least as much as I require from airplane entertainment.&nbsp; Though this was a standard, by-the-books brohmance, at least the female characters had some depth to them.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 January 2010<br />The Informant!<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2009<br />Location: KLM flight from JFK to AMS<br />Format: airplane video screen<br />Company: none/rest of flight<br /><p>I had wanted to see this as a mild Soderbergh fan and because the trailer looked good, but it was pretty limp - definitely a film for a plane.&nbsp; Of course I can't be sure that I wasn't totally missing all of the brilliance because I watched it reduced to a small videoscreen, but I still feel confident about this.&nbsp; I mean, this wasn't terrible, but I don't really see why it was made.&nbsp; Maybe Soderbergh was trying to take an interesting story and ruin it, by dragging out it and getting Matt Damon to goof through the whole film instead of trying to do something interesting with the role.&nbsp; Scott Bakula was the highlight, I guess, though the guy who played Buster on <em>Arrested Development</em> was nice to see as well.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 January 2010<br />The Box<br />Richard Kelly, US, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>A new Richard Kelly film to enjoy, or laugh at, or just be generally confused by.&nbsp; This was R. Kelly's attempt to show that he could make something "mainstream" after the disasterous reception of <em>Southland Tales</em>, and this is very straightforward filmmaking.&nbsp; The resulting film, taken from a Richard Matheson story or an old <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode, is pure Hollywood, fitting in the same genre of "stupid" sci-fi as <em>Knowing</em> or <em>The Happening</em>.&nbsp; Except, about halfway through, Kelly hijacks his own film as best as he can manage, putting in some weird afterlife/portal stuff flanked by his usually terrible CGI effects.&nbsp; This film is set in the 70s for some reason, probably so Kelly can again show off his flair for period styles.&nbsp; And to good effect - this is all about surfaces, whether it's wallpaper, carpet, linoleum, or polyester clothing.&nbsp; The patterns and textures are chosen well and the props are as perfect as <em>Mad Men</em>'s set design, which somewhat masks the absolutely atrocious dialogue and acting.&nbsp; Much like I found myself rooting for the Joker in <em>The Dark Knight</em>, I wanted this depressingly perfect family (perfect, even down to their imperfections like Cameron Diaz's foot disfigurement) to have as much grief and misery brought on them as possible.&nbsp; No real twists or surprises here, but if you like tales of sci-fi manipulation such as Vonnegut's <em>The Sirens of Titan</em>, then you'll find a lot to enjoy here. There's a lot of dialogue that made me laugh out loud ("I understand you are a fan of the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre...") and a lot of nice surrealist details to amplify the creep factor, like weird gazes, creepy old people everywhere, and strange obsessions with water.&nbsp; Tarkovsky he is not, but R. Kelly showed in <em>Southland Tales</em> that he was capable of grand artistic gestures.&nbsp; Gone from here is the vision of media-bent simulacrum that filled that film; what remains is the hammyness, though without a sarcastic framework to explain it.&nbsp; You also get a terrible soundtrack of Hollywood spinetingling moments, creepy strings, eerie suspense (to just perfectly match the very slow zooms) instead of <em>Southland</em>'s brilliantly pastiched layers --&nbsp; but I guess these are the rules of the game which Kelly admitted he was undertaking. I would probably rank this above <em>Donnie Darko</em> but I don't know if I'd sit through it again - the plot is not quite fucked up enough as the Kellyness is mere salad dressing on something relatively straightforward.&nbsp; I doubt anyone will ever let him realise his true visions again so maybe he was a "one and done" director; that may actually be for the better, because I think this and <em>Darko</em> prove that cinema is not necessarily the right medium for him.&nbsp; The guy is a genius, don't get me wrong, but he isn't very talented at directing actors or constructing filmed entertainment.&nbsp; Though I have a feeling this will grow on me, and six months from now I will think back on this as "brilliant".</p><br /><br /><br /><br />12 January 2010<br />Big Fan<br />Robert D. Siegel, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Patton Oswalt is a surprisingly good actor, delivering this role with the right mix of pathos and humour.&nbsp; I expected this to be a laughfest, but it was far darker and not in a cruel or manipulative way.&nbsp; Nor was this an updating of Fred Exley's <em>A Fan's Notes</em>, though the team was the same.&nbsp; This was a pretty decent rumination on the psychology of the sports fan, actually, just taken to an extreme level.&nbsp; Overall, I really enjoyed this because it was a far different film than I expected, though I would never watch it again; I guess it provided a pretty solid block of entertainment and impressed me with some of it's visual compositions as well.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 January 2010<br />Vinyan<br />Fabrice Du Welz, France / Belgium / UK / Australia, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This film was a beautiful, intense experience that walked a thin line between dreamy mysticism and all-out horror.&nbsp; I think it's probably best viewed as a ghost story rather than the crushing, physical horror of <em>Calvaire</em>, though the Burmese jungle attains the same sense of location-based terror as the Wallonian woods did.&nbsp; Emannuelle B&eacute;art is stunning in this - I have never really been that appreciative of her as an actress before, and she more than makes up for Rufus Sewell's second rate Clive Owen imitation.&nbsp; The slow pacing is what I kinda liked about the first hour of this film - the lurid, dizzying visuals drew me in and I really wished I had a larger screen or TV to watch it on.&nbsp; This film is extremely hot - not sexy, but humid, with sweat and muggyness infusing every frame, even when it rains or they are in the water.&nbsp; The idea of a film inspired by the tsunami is a good one and the dread comes like a wave of its own.&nbsp; Because there's nothing particularly surprising here, it's more of a film that just kinda bums you out overall rather than hits you over the head.&nbsp; Shades of <em>Who Could Kill a Child?</em> and even the Indiana Jones movies made this feel strangely familiar, too.&nbsp; Once it switched gears into the final act it does become something different - maybe a bit less special, but it avoids having to follow through on the dreams (aren't nightmares easier?).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 January 2010<br />Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans<br />Werner Herzog, USA, 2009<br />Location: Finnkino Tennispalatsi<br />Format: 35mm film projected in cinema<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>Herzog's "crazyness" is surely an act but I generally don't mind intentional eccentricity in films.&nbsp; I always say Nicolas Cage is the best B-movie actor in the world, so it makes sense to cast him in this fucked up role.&nbsp; I have no idea why Herzog made this film - what motivated him, or why he felt this story needed to be told.&nbsp; It had just enough insanity in it to stay fresh and entertaining, and avoid being a shitty cop movie.&nbsp; The shot on video look is purely painful to look at and it complemented the script, but it looked especially horrible to me cause we had to sit in the front row.&nbsp; The script stayed pretty rooted in logic - I mean, it wasn't nonsense or intentionally messy/contradictory - and maybe that was beneficial to it.&nbsp; I don't really understand why this was set in New Orleans since this made really no attempt to comment on Katrina, except maybe the obvious metaphor of a destroyed city.&nbsp; But the ultimate moral is that it's okay to be horrible and corrupt cause things can work out in the end, right?&nbsp; I hurt my neck staring up at this from that vantage point, but I also hurt my brain watching this.&nbsp; On the absolute value scale this ranks pretty high, though to be a proper B-movie this should not have exceeded the 90 minute mark.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 January 2010<br />A Serious Man<br />Ethan Coen, Joel Coen, USA / UK / France, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>To cap off a strange and largely unproductive day (where I slept from 9 AM til 4 PM and spent all of my time brewing beer or cleaning/organising) I checked out the Coens' latest, which I didn't actually know anything about except they used largely unknown actors in it.&nbsp; I pretty much loved this.&nbsp; It's a strange film for them, with different concerns than usual, and a much more gentle approach to humour.&nbsp; It's about the most autobiographical I think I've ever seen from them, but not overly so.&nbsp; Though it was a tragic tale, they wrenched a lot of empathy from the lead character by making him a fairly restrained soul.&nbsp; The subject matter is the whole "dark side of the American dream/family" that Heller tackled in <em>Something Happened</em>, but of course filtered through their own Midwestern Jewishness.&nbsp; In terms of Judaism, this film actually managed to comment on the complexities of the belief structure humourously, without completely ridiculing it (but also without getting too deep as to be off-putting).&nbsp; Roger Deakins does his usual magic here; the period setting doesn't feel quite right, but then again, I never lived through that period what do I know?&nbsp; But by feeling slighty off, and a tad bit revisionist, it takes on (visually) that slightly cartoonish personal touch that makes it somewhat special.&nbsp; Nice work too in ending it "suddenly", which reminded me of <em>No Country for Old Men</em>'s refusal to&nbsp; play out like films are "supposed" to.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 January 2010<br />The Quiller Memorandum<br />Michael Anderson, UK / USA, 1966<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I love this era of spy films, though this is more about trust and human emotions than the flash and dazzle associated with Eurospy films.&nbsp; But it definitely ranks up among the best, probably due to Harold Pinter writing the screenplay.&nbsp; George Segal is a fave of mine though I think that's due to my affection for some of his films, cause he's not brilliant.&nbsp; He plays the character with a real buoyancy that is certainly charming and gives the film a lot of momentum, even when the 'action' is slow.&nbsp; I like how he isn't a brilliant James Bond type spy - he sorta screws up mostly, and is more lucky than clever, but not in a comical way.&nbsp; I'd say that overall this is a far better film than <em>The Odessa File</em>, at least as far as "hunting down Nazis in the 60s" films go.&nbsp; It's a great topic and I'd be happy to see more in the style.&nbsp; I expected Alec Guinness to dominate this film but he was more like a simple caricature; it was Max von Sydow who really stole the show.&nbsp; Great, possibly amazing ending though maybe not enough ambiguity in the "is she or isn't she?" issue.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />20 January 2010<br />The Holcroft Covenant<br />John Frankenheimer, UK, 1985<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Ah, Frankenheimer in decline.&nbsp; I think Clive Owen is probably the Michael Caine of this era - British, likeable, and takes a lot of crap scripts but is capable of the occasional great performance.&nbsp; This is not one of Caine's best -- or else it's an amazing bit of performance art, a la Tony Clifton.&nbsp; I actually can't tell because this film may have been a parody of conspiracy/paranoid films (a genre that Frankenheimer more or less fathered);;&nbsp; if so, it plays it so close to the bone that it just comes off as a bad movie.&nbsp; And I think that's unfortunately what <em>The Holcroft Covenant</em> is.&nbsp; I'm reminded of <em>Winter Kills</em>, but that at least lays it on really thick in a few places, to make the satire obvious.&nbsp; This, well ... it's just really bad.&nbsp; The historical sequence during the credits was so poorly done that I actually expected this to be some sort of Mel Brooks-style parody. The aesthetics of the time certainly play a role - the conspiracy thriller from the 70s is dark and often genuinely paranoid, but this is almost cartoonish.&nbsp; Everything is spelled out, and you can see the ending coming from a mile away.&nbsp; The notion of a global terrorist network is presented so far to the end of the film that it's barely intimidating, and Michael Caine is so goofy in his naievete that I found myself wanting to skip to the end.&nbsp; Anthony Andrews is a pretty good 80s bad guy, I guess, but Bernard Hepton is such a caricature that it's hard to take it seriously.&nbsp; I certainly liked the cheesy parts, even if they were meant to be taken seriously; Andrews explaining how they were brothers because he killed a man too; Caine's tears in the final shot; every scene with the conductor ... it's almost hard to believe this is the same sociopath who made <em>Seconds</em>.&nbsp; Also notable is the world's least exciting helicopter/car chase, set to the obligatory drum machine thump of synth-heavy 80s music.&nbsp; Was there studio pressure to make things so <em>obvious</em> in the mid-80s?&nbsp; Did the rise of the blockbuster put pressure on everyone else to have extremely financially sucessful films?&nbsp; You can see the decline in this genre of film - the way we go from <em>The Parallax View</em> to this to whatever shit is in theaters now.&nbsp; But I think my own interest in 70s film poisons my enjoyment, cause I'm pretty sure if you transplanted this film ten years earlier I would love it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 January 2010<br />Up in the Air<br />Jason Reitman, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was better than I thought.&nbsp; By the time the wedding scene came around, I expected this to reinforce family values and marriage in the same way that <em>Juno</em> reinforced the pro-life message.&nbsp; Instead, Reitman opted for easy existentialism, but I'll take it.&nbsp; <em>Up in the Air</em> was pleasantly enjoyable, due in part to Clooney who I do quite like (as A-listers go), and because it kept moving and never settled into schmaltz.&nbsp; I won't ever make the mistake I made with <em>Juno</em>, which is watching it a second time - this would have (ironically) been a perfect airplane film.&nbsp; I fly more than probably any of my friends (hopefully less this year, but I'm sure it'll be enough to justify my airports PBT category) and I'm fascinated by the airport as the terminal of existence.&nbsp; Ballard knows this, and though I haven't read that much of his work, it's (to me) one of the ultimate symbols of postmodern space.&nbsp; Reitman taps into the alienation and loss of affect that was talked about in my "Writing the Disaster" seminar, though it's a bit simplistic and overt.&nbsp; I think it could have been a far more provocative film if it had played this up from a darker, even sinister angle, instead of swinging for the personal.&nbsp; Maybe some more juxtaposition, but I would expect that from something so geared towards middlebrow Hollywood senses.&nbsp; And of course this could have benefited from more Zach G, but that goes without saying.&nbsp; Danny McBride is great, as always, and manages to show his goofy side even through some cheesy Oscar-aspiring dialogue.&nbsp; I suspect this will beat out <em>The Hurt Locker</em> for best picture, which is criminal, but still a million bazillion times better than <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>.&nbsp; I should make a fanedit of this where I take out the sappyness and emphasize the alienation - maybe cut out the narration, change the soundtrack to some minimal electronica, maybe run the whole thing as black &amp; white ... and I would change the ending so after Clooney's ill-fated Chicago trip, he goes back to his hotel room and puts a gun in his mouth.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2010<br />Tout va bien<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Gorin, France / Italy, 1972<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>2010 is already 1/24th over and I haven't gotten back to the Godard project!&nbsp; I've seen this before and didn't look forward to watching it again, but I loved it a second time through.&nbsp; Like <em>Pierrot</em>, this was also the end of an era for Godard and it references many of his past works - the repetition of dialogue from <em>Le Mepris</em> regarding the couple loving each other; the actors as themselves recalling <em>Two or Three Things</em>; especially the stunning supermarket sequence which recalls -- and even bests, in my opinion -- <em>Week End</em>'s long car crash sequence.&nbsp; Godard was in the hospital during the filming of this and really, this is Gorin's masterpiece - but by this point, they two of them were working so closely that their methods had blended together.&nbsp; It certainly feels like a 'return to form' for Godard, taking off from <em>Vladimir et Rosa</em>'s narrative return and incorporating a glossier, more accessible vision.&nbsp; The set piece of the factory rooms in cross-section, while a simple concept, is stunning, and this is visually a delight that no doubt inspired today's filmmakers like Gondry and Wes Anderson.&nbsp; Each of the three leads gets a monologue, and Yves Montand's really clearly is Godard himself speaking.&nbsp; It's crazy how Mai 1968 was such an event, still hanging over this film four years later.&nbsp; It kind of made me think how every film Godard made in this period was his attempt to come to terms with it; it puts all of the doctrinaire waffling into a whole new personal perspective, and it's kind of crazy it took me this many films to understand it.&nbsp; I guess what I like about the early period of Godard's work are those inspiring, classic cinematic moments - Belmondo's performances, great lines of dialogue, wonderfully brash attitudes.&nbsp; And I like the essay basis of the Marxist period, even when it's a bit turgid.&nbsp; This combines those currents really well, and it has a sense of finality to it when it ends, which makes sense since the Son et Image period is on the horizon.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2010<br />The Squid and the Whale<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Simon Morris<br /><p>I had joked to Simon that he should see this because it was about him.&nbsp; i said that because he grew up in NYC and his father is a writer; I had no idea that his parents got divorced when he was the same age as Frank, the younger brother in this film.&nbsp; So maybe this hit a bit too close to home for him.&nbsp; Hopefully Simon's father isn't an enormously immature, self-absorbed asshole like Jeff Daniels' character;&nbsp; since Mr. Morris writes nonfiction about botany I'll assume there's a difference.&nbsp; The second time through (after a few years) I still enjoyed this and found myself laughing a great deal, but I don't think this is a masterpiece.&nbsp; I think I said about another movie that Jesse Eisenberg is a poor man's Michael Cera, but actually I think he's a far, far better actor.&nbsp; The heart and soul of this film, however, is Owen Kline as 10-year old Frank, who unbelievably has not acted in anything since.&nbsp; (Maybe he's trying to get through middle school first).&nbsp; This has Wes Anderson's influence all over it, but I initially commended Baumbach for being a bit more restrained and human than, say, <em>The Royal Tennenbaums</em>; a second time through, I found a few of the music choices to be glaringly obtrusive and an overall unwillingness to put passion into the film in the same way that Wes does.&nbsp; This is probably commendable to many people, though.&nbsp; I still enjoyed this because of how brutal it was, but it's a far cry from <em>Margo at the Wedding</em>, which in retrospect, was a pretty amazing and eviscerating film.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 January 2010<br />Hallelujah the Hills<br />Adolfas Mekas, USA, 1963<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Agent Strohm has been repping this for years but I never got around to actually watching it.&nbsp; I think this is 'obscure for a reason', but I can totally understand why he would love it so much -- I could imagine seeing this myself in those formative years, when I was learning about avant-garde cinema, and being inspired by the zanyness (and perhaps allured by the obscurity).&nbsp; It's no diferent to the weird pedestal that I put all of the films I saw in Judson's class on.&nbsp; This is actually a pretty remarkable film in some ways; the difficult part is how well over half of the film are just Jack and Leo dicking around in the woods.&nbsp; At first I expected an absurdist masterpiece of New York, pre-flower power underground cinema, like <em>Chafed Elbows</em> -- and there were a few great moments of slapstick that had me laughing out loud.&nbsp; The narrative structure is pretty disjointed but it's not a plot I think has to be carefully followed.&nbsp; I was really appreciative of how the landscape scenery was shot - this is quite technically accomplished for being a no-budget feature film of its time, and in particular some of the tracking shots (such as Jack running to the creek while undressing) are pretty impressive.&nbsp; There's probably some sort of meaning in this about brotherhood, or maybe I'm just reading into that because it's a director-cinematographer fraternity here.&nbsp; Some scenes were quite dreamlike, and the ongoing electric piano-flute soundtrack was at times mesmerising.&nbsp; It certainly dominates my memory of the film, but maybe that's cause I got bored during all of the woodsy parts.&nbsp; The ending sequence with the dueling jailbirds is a pretty wonderful non-sequitur.&nbsp; And even though this is nothing like <em>Chafed Elbows</em> -- it's truly its own beast -- it made me want to watch some Downey again.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2010<br />The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers<br />Judith Ehrlich, Rick Goldsmith, USA, 2009<br />Location: Bristol Theatre, Kluuvi<br />Format: Video projected in cinema<br />Company: none<br /><p>I bought the six-film ticket so I'm listing the whole cost of it here, in case I don't end up going to any others.&nbsp; This documentary focused on the life of Daniel Ellsberg, the person who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press.&nbsp; it was your standard contemporary political documentary, painting Ellsberg as an ultimate hero and staging a few re-enactments.&nbsp; It goes for the heavy stylisation, like it wants to be an Errol Morris film, but uses some terrible typefaces which made the whole thing feel amateurish.&nbsp; I'm not knocking it though - this was pretty engrossing, and obviously relevant as a portrait of America at a moral low.&nbsp; The filmmakers didn't try to draw any parallels to the Bush administration or Iraq, which was good, because that's a whole other sordid tale.&nbsp; At first I was thinking about how if there was a Pentagon Papers today, the media wouldn't be interested in it.&nbsp; (Of course with the Internet, the ability for a newspaper to print it wouldn't be important as there are awesome methods of dissemination now).&nbsp; But when I realised, through Ellsberg's only comments, is that the media stopped focusing on the content of the Pentagon Papers and focused on the issue of the leak, Ellsberg's celebrity, and the media's own role in the debacle - ignoring his statements about how many bombs were being dropped on innocent children every day, when reporting on it.&nbsp; That hit me pretty hard, because obviously that's exactly how it would be today -- the media love their own roles in these things and the truths are out there for anyone who cares (and no one does).&nbsp; The tie-in of the Ellsberg case with Watergate was fascinating, and the filmmakers couldn't resist using lots of recordings of Nixon sounding evil and buffoonish (which the Finnish theatre audience laughed at every time.&nbsp; They also gave the film a round of applause after the credits rolled -- will that happen every night at Docpoint?).&nbsp; There's one great shot of Ellsberg , Zinn and Chomsky hanging out at an anti-war protest together in '71 that's worth the price of the ticket alone.&nbsp; Ellsberg is probably the greatest whistle-blower of all time, and he seems no less committed today, and I did find it actually pretty inspiring.&nbsp; I hate to say this, but I would really enjoy a dramatisation in the style of <em>All the President's Men</em>.&nbsp; Ellsberg looks like Bill Boichel crossed with Chevy Chase, too.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2010<br />Loot<br />Darius Marder, USA, 2008<br />Location: Bristol Theatre, Kluuvi<br />Format: Video projected in cinema<br />Company: none<br /><p>The theatre was almost completely empty for this, a pretty great documentary about a loser treasure hunter trying simultaneously to find lost World War II treasures through two old veterans.&nbsp; On the surface the film is a (slightly scary) view of obsession, full of unintentional comedy in a mocking way (like <em>American Movie</em>), but as it develops it starts to turn into something deeper.&nbsp; The protagonist, while clearly not the brightest bulb out there, is strangely likeable in his desperation, and the relationships he forges with the two elderly gentlemen are fascinating.&nbsp; While <em>Loot</em> is modest in its style and technical means, it succeeds because it works with such strong material and doesn't try to dress it up.&nbsp; Does Lance really care about these people, or is he just looking to make some money through exploitation?&nbsp; As the film goes on a bit further, it really becomes about the ghosts of war.&nbsp; Andrew is clearly tortured by his acts of killing, even sixty years later, and the treasure map is clearly a substitute for some sort of personal penance.&nbsp; Likewise, Darrel's emotional breakdown at the end of the film (as well as the incredible awkwardness of him and the SS officer together so many years later) captures something far, far greater than a mere collection of jewels.&nbsp; I was really into this film, and it's sad the theatre was so empty.&nbsp; The director was present and stayed around for a Q&amp;A afterwards but I didn't stick around, which I am now regretting (though I would have probably just asked questions because I felt bad, since the 12 Finns in the [500-seat] theatre weren't likely to ask anything).&nbsp; At least I avoided that awkwardness.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2010<br />Rented Lips<br />Robert Downey Sr., USA, 1988<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I've "sorta" wanted to see this for about ten years but never been able to find it -- it was always the holy grail for cheapo Blockbuster outlet VHS tapes (though it always eluded me).&nbsp; This sounds too good to not watch - a Robert Downey Sr. film, written by and starring Martin Mull, and also featuring Shelly Berman, Eileen Brennan, and a young and surely coked-up Robert Downey Jr -- and music by Van Dyke Parks!&nbsp; Well, yeah, this sucks, which I expected.&nbsp; But I was hoping for some weird breakthrough moments of Downey's genius, like <em>Hugo Pool</em> had, but this was pretty much not happening.&nbsp; There were a few offbeat jokes, but (I never thought I'd say this) I blame Martin Mull, because his script just plays it too safe.&nbsp; The overall best thing was the fake film they were shooting, which was a demented Nazi-porno musical Halloween story.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this falls into the category of crappy comedies that end with a big song and dance number - which is supposed to be impressive, I guess.&nbsp; Jennifer Tilly is the real poison that makes this so hard to sit through, but Downey Jr's performance is so fucked up and over-the-top that it almost makes up for it.&nbsp; I guess it's cool how at the end, the whole thing was a dream, or maybe not because of the closing credits - like it couldn't even commit to that.&nbsp; It's funny to think that this was 20 years ago, and twenty years before that was <em>Pound</em> and <em>Putney Swope</em>.&nbsp; I should just watch <em>Up the Academy</em> and whatever Downey Sr. films I have left to see at this point, just to be done with them.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />31 January 2010<br />Det r&#xF8;de kapel<br />Mads Br&#xFC;gger, Denmark, 2009<br />Location: Bio Rex, Lasipalatsi<br />Format: Video projected in cinema<br />Company: Sarah Alden, Taneli<br /><p>AMAZING!&nbsp; This has to rank up among the greatest documentary films I have ever seen, definitely in <em>Capturing the Freidmans</em> territory.&nbsp; The synopsis is a sure winner - two Danish-Koreans comedians visit North Korea to perform a comedy act as a show of Danish-North Korean cultural exchange.&nbsp; Except, one is handicapped (cerebral palsy I guess, though he calls himself a 'spastic') and the filmmaker is looking to push the envelope as far as possible within the rather rigid guidelines of the world's most brutal police dictatorship.&nbsp; On an entertainment scale, this is off the charts - every provocation/awkwardness that Sasha Baron Cohen made his name from is far surpassed here, and the stakes are much higher.&nbsp; There's also a pretty complex examination of the human costs of totalitarianism, one which comes across perhaps accidentally, given the filmmaker's own agenda.&nbsp; And there's also an investigation into the politics of documentary filmmaking and exploitation in general.&nbsp; Br&uuml;gger admits that he is exploiting Jacob's handicap for various causes, and the relationship between the two is quite difficult at times.&nbsp; While I don't think Br&uuml;gger (who really does seem like a massive cock) should be commended for this, it is admirable that is up-front about his own dickishness and lack of moral scruples, and does not attempt to whitewash the situation or make himself look good at any point.&nbsp; If anything, this is probably a film that the two comedians would be quite at peace with.&nbsp; Jacob is so brilliant that its hard not to love him, and his refusal to pump his fist during the anti-American demonstration is the most courageous act of defiance imaginable.&nbsp; Br&uuml;gger's lame ass copout isn't hidden at all, which is refreshing, and even the fucked up interactions with Mrs. Pak indicate the humanity behind even the most stone-faced agent of the regime.&nbsp; I'm definitely a sucker for anything about North Korea but this blows away everything else I've seen on the topic.&nbsp; Jacob's spastic Danish allows him to say the truth in front of the authorities (because they cannot understand) but the film doesn't overplay this.&nbsp; The absurd acts, such as reading the poem in front of the statue of Kim Il Sung, or giving the pizza scooper as a gift are more absurd and brilliant than anything you could script.&nbsp; And there's a point where Br&uuml;gger says how post-modern irony doesn't exist in North Korea and it's true -- this film takes an absurd concept and tries to work it in the most asburd place in the world - in some ways, this is what happens when absurdity is trumped by greater absurdity.&nbsp; Also, best use of an Oasis song ever, in any context.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />31 January 2010<br />Das Lied von den zwei Pferden<br />Byambasuren Davaa, Germany, 2009<br />Location: Maxim 1, Kluuvi<br />Format: 35mm film projected in cinema<br />Company: Sarah Alden<br /><p>I ended the week of Docpoint with a film actually projected on film for once, and thank god, because the cinematography was the only thing this turd had going for it.&nbsp; This was probably funded by the Mongolian tourist board because it makes Mongolia seem pretty damn appealing.&nbsp; The story was absolutely turgid, and there was really nothing nonfictional about it - you could tell every conversation was staged and the entire thing was a contrived pile of boring shit.&nbsp; Juuso and I were talking earlier about how most of the Docpoint films seemed to either be about suffering people and human rights issues, or boring films about old people.&nbsp; This fell into the later category (though, I guess <em>Loot</em> did too, and I loved that one) but without even being a documentary.&nbsp; Yeah, the Mongolian steppes did look nice but unfortunately, there was a narrative attached.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 February 2010<br />The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen<br />Stephen Norrington, USA / Germany / Czech Republic / UK, 2003<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Alan Moore's stubborn refusal to have anything to do with filmed adaptation of his comics makes a lot more sense once you've seen this.&nbsp; I'm not sure that he did, though.&nbsp; <em>Watchmen</em> (the book) is truly, I believe, one of the masterpieces of the graphic novel form and the film adaptation does a decent enough job despite the hack director.&nbsp; But after seeing this (where I haven't read the comics), I would never want to check out any of Moore's work -- which is precisely a reason to justify Moore's attitude. (Had I not already read <em>Watchmen</em>, after seeing this, I wouldn't). &nbsp; I'm sure the <em>League</em> comic is "better" than this film (though I try to avoid comparing apples and oranges) but I wonder if it touches on any of the themes that <em>Watchmen</em> does.&nbsp; Judging from the film along, it's just a bunch of wanking off over Victorian-era fantasy figures, strung out with superhero cliches.&nbsp; I'm sure Moore gets all postmodern with it, but Norrington's film doesn't even question the structures of its own genre.&nbsp; While watching this, i tried to think about why this flopped while shit like <em>Pirates of the Carribean</em> or <em>Spider-Man</em> are hits.&nbsp; The scripts aren't really any better or worse than each other; they're all by-the-books bland, merely excuses for special effects/action sequences.&nbsp; One factor has to do with the acting - this is a bunch of nobodies + Sean Connery, and the rest of them are awful.&nbsp; Connery at least gets through it, which is easy for him since this is just a James Bond film with fantasy elements and a historical setting.&nbsp; Another thing that shocked me was how terrible the CGI was.&nbsp; I know <em>Lord of the Rings</em> was made around the same time as this, yet the budgetary differences are staggering.&nbsp; Some scenes of this looked like the work Asylum Films did on <em>Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus</em>.&nbsp; I guess stories like this are made for steampunk dorks and high school history dweebs, but I can't deal with it.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />3 February 2010<br />Letter to Jane: An Investigation About a Still<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Gorin, France, 1972<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is the final collaboration between Godard and Gorin, a film that is perfect when thought of as a 'special feature' on the <em>Tout va Bien</em> DVD, except that DVDs didn't exist in 1972.&nbsp; As an entire film of narration over a photograph, this is surprisingly interesting.&nbsp; G &amp; G explore the meaning of this photography, specifically with regards to their own relationship to Jane Fonda because of <em>Tout va Bien</em> and with their own engagement with political filmmaking.&nbsp; Obviously this is a bit dry (and much less visually interesting than the other Dziga Vertov Group films -- actually, this is less visually interesting than pretty much any film ever, except maybe Derek Jarman's <em>Blue</em>) but the text is fairly lucid.&nbsp; There are a few confusing parts, such as when they try to make excuses for being men talking about a woman, but otherwise it's a surprisingly intelligent investigation into celebrity, gaze, war and race.&nbsp; The disillusionment with the left is felt here too, though the film is actually less concerned with politics in of itself as with the role that the image plays culturally, which is probably a more essential concern to a filmmaker anyway.&nbsp; I think this is a good transition into the Son et Image period, which I guess I will begin soon with <em>ici et ailleurs</em>.&nbsp; Also, I liked how they called John Steinbeck a 'future fascist' and the way they dropped 'motherfucker' a few times for comedic effect - putting a few odd jokes in an otherwise dry polemical text is totally a good move.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />3 February 2010<br />Thank You for Smoking<br />Jason Reitman, USA, 2005<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is a somewhat confusing one.&nbsp; I think I liked this better than Reitman's two other films despite it's inarticulate politics, but you can tell it's a debut film.&nbsp; It's a definitely accomplished first film, but still pretty uneven.&nbsp; For one thing, it uses narration to cover up weak storytelling (unlike <em>Up in the Air</em>, which actually uses the voiceovers to dig into the mind of the character) -- you can really see it during the strangely rushed ending.&nbsp; And it's also weird how the beginning and end of the film have a weird goofball humour, but the middle is rather straightened out.&nbsp; It's cool to make a film with a morally ambiguous protagonist that has no easy answers, but I'm not sure if I liked the way that it held back from commentary.&nbsp; Also, can Sam Elliott do anything else besides play the old, weary cowboy type?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 February 2010<br />L&#x27;uomo la donna e la bestia<br />Alberto Cavallone, Italy, 1977<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is one of the strangest films I have ever seen, and I say this as someone who greatly enjoys surreal and unusual film.&nbsp; I often make the mistake of confusing incoherence with genius so I'm going to hold back on making my pronouncement on the artistic merit of this. I don't know a whole lot about Italian cinema, but I can't help but compare this to what I have seen.&nbsp; In terms of dramaturgy, acting, and editing the only real comparison would be the Japanese film <em>Throw Your Books Into the Street</em>, but crossed with Fellini's <em>Amarcord</em>.&nbsp; But the Elio Petri film <em>In a Beautiful House in the Country</em> had a very similar approach to sexuality, showing it as an undercurrent of violence and madness in everything.&nbsp; The whole deranged village idea is actually more like a precursor to <em>Blue Velvet</em>, though I had trouble determining if the filmmaker was celebrating small town life or attacking it.&nbsp; There are so many mysteries here that I don't know where to begin; it's so perplexing to me, perhaps because it doesn't fit into any acceptable mold of surrealism I am previously familiar with.&nbsp; The shocking and transgressive imagery in this film is mostly packed near the end, and while it's pretty crazy, it's not what I found so remarkable.&nbsp; This was pretty fun to watch, and actually kind of low key for most of the film, so I could see myself viewing this again, maybe with a friend, and trying to draw some conclusions from it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 February 2010<br />The Final Programme<br />Robert Fuest, UK, 1973<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This weird sci-fi film reminded me a lot of Dr. Who, but being that it's British and from the 70's, that comparison is probably unavoidable.&nbsp; Jenny Runacre is stunning but the lead role, by Jon Finch, is totally bizarre.&nbsp; Finch stumbles through the film like a drunken, wanna be rockstar, slighty paunchy and quick to deliver bad one-liners.&nbsp; It's almost like some parody of a confident leading man, except his sins against good taste are just too exaggerated to overlook.&nbsp; The fight scene at the end in particular has Finch quipping (overdubbed) clever comments at every junction of the fight, turning the film suddenly into slapstick.&nbsp; The actual plot and sci-fi elements are pretty murky but the great solarise effect and other creepy edits are surreal enough to keep me entertained.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 February 2010<br />Ici et ailleurs<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Gorin, France, 1976<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>With <em>Ici et ailleurs</em> I'm entering a new era of Godard's ouvre - the SonImage period, generally seen as a transitional period between the Dziga Vertov Group films and his "return" to traditional cinematic forms.&nbsp; What this really means is that he started to closely collaborate with Anne-Marie Mieville and explore the use of video, as well as return to the personal aspect of filmmaking that he seemed to abandon from 68-72.&nbsp; I found <em>Ici et ailleurs</em> to be quite stunning, but I'm not sure what that's worth, because as this Godard project is going along I'm migrating from skepticism to an increased appreciation of everything the man did.&nbsp; I mean, I said positive things about most of the Dziga Vertov Group films even though Godard himself renounced them later.&nbsp; The reason <em>Ici et ailleurs</em> is a turning point is definitely evident in the style, which uses video technology like wipes and character genereation, but also in the way it uses the new technology to question and re-examine his prior work.&nbsp; The film is ostensibly a reworking of the material shot in 1970 for the abandoned <em>Victory</em>, a verit&eacute; work about the Palestinian Liberation Army.&nbsp; This material is used here, years later, with additional scenery and a narration that explores the meaning of images and sounds.&nbsp; This aspect isn't really a depature, as every Godard work since <em>Le Gai Savoir</em> has struggled with the conceptual framework of cinema, particularly down to the formal elements of sound and image.&nbsp; What is different here, I guess, is the focus is not so concerned with the overall political picture, I would say looking back to the concept of the artist and creativity in general. <em>Ici et ailleurs</em> also draws some conclusions, particularly that <em>ici</em> are simple images (the fabricated family, watching TV, with an unemployed father distracted by political struggles) and <em>ailleurs</em> are simple images too (the Palestinian militants discussing how to ambush Israeli soldiers).&nbsp; It's almost like Godard is saying that all of the overintellectualism of the past 6 years was a huge waste of time and he failed to realise what was directly in front of him.&nbsp; The stylistic devices at play here are great - this has the feel of old 1970s video art, which is what it is, I guess - and there is just the right amount of playfulness to prevent this from putting me to sleep.&nbsp; Though it sets itself out as a clear break from the previous films,&nbsp; I don't really think this is a massive departure from&nbsp; the Dziga Vertov Group; but thats because I watched these all sequentially and I can see how Godard and Gorin's personal uncertainties about thier political situation crept into those films.&nbsp; Those films, particularly the last few and <em>Pravda</em>, are more about disillusionment with politics than any actual political struggle.&nbsp; This theme is carried on in <em>Ici et ailleurs</em>, just made more overt.&nbsp; The footage of the Palestinians is amazing, but somehow it seems false here, almost like actors on a sound stage.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 February 2010<br />The Brothers Solomon<br />Bob Odenkirk, USA, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I know this is generally regarded as a crap film but I really liked it.&nbsp; What does that say about me?&nbsp; That I have terrible taste in easy comedy?&nbsp; I think this stands up well against stuff like <em>Step Brothers</em> cause Arnett and Forte are great, and I laughed out loud many times.&nbsp; Obviously Odenkirk + these guys are capable of so much more but given the parameters they chose to work within (possibly because that's all they could get away with in a studio system?) i think they made something pretty decent.&nbsp; My biggest complaint would be that the black character was such a stupid stereotype, saying typically "black" things throughout, kinda like the role Daryl from <em>The Office</em> gets in everything he acts in.&nbsp; <em>The Brothers Solomon</em> was actually funny though.&nbsp; There was a lot of scenario-based humour, meaning situations that were just inherently ridiculous that they would ride out to the point of being truly comitted - like the baby at the end being black, but they don't notice.&nbsp; I've seen all of Bob Odenkirk's feature length films now and I think he's actually pretty underrated because all 3 of them are pretty good films; I would put forth that he's been way more successful than someone like David Wain.&nbsp; <em>Melvin Goes to Dinner</em> is actually a film I've been thinking about lately so it might be time to revisit it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 February 2010<br />Brief Interviews with Hideous Men<br />John Krasinski, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's a weird thing, this film.&nbsp; It sounds great, on paper - an adaptation of one of DFW's best stories, directed by Jim from <em>The Office</em> and featuring a bunch of great comedic bit players.&nbsp; But the resulting film is quite uneven, and it possibly ruins the story by grafting a tighter narrative onto what is an episodic, patchwork bit of writing.&nbsp; The one achievement of this film that actually relates to DFW's work is that it manages to convey some true misery underneath all of the humour, though I'm probably being too kind to it.&nbsp; It's been years since i've read the story, so I don't remember how many of these interviews are verbatim and how many are new.&nbsp; But I don't remember the interviewer herself having any role in the story apart from being represented as "...", which probably is what the film tries to do with all of the shots of the back of her head.&nbsp; The story of the young sexy nerdy researcher trying to come to terms with the horrible behaviors of men is pretty shitty, though - not far away from those quirky indie romance films I hate so much. And by explicitly telling Timothy Hutton that her project is "to understand the effects of the feminist movement through men", I think Krasinski has grafted a really narrow reading onto the original story.&nbsp; The commercial pressures are all over this film, though what results is still pretty unmarketable, just artistically compromised.&nbsp; Krasinski's own monologue at the end is absolutely dreadful - he has no chops for serious acting, and should probably just stick with the cute smile which is all he's really good at.&nbsp; I think a few points were good- the long, surreal scene with Burrell from <em>The Wire</em> is fantastic, and if it stood as a short film on its own, it would be very commendable.&nbsp; But the British kid with the term paper - yuck.&nbsp; The long story about the girl in the airport -- double yuck.&nbsp; It's probably supposed to simultaneously present compassion and misogyny as some sort of insight into the modern male, but it just comes off like a gimmicky one-joke routine. One of the reasons I think DFW was a great writer is that his writing actually comes to terms with the challenge of writing in the world of multimedia, information, etc.&nbsp; Adapting this writing into a film is probably a doomed project no matter how one goes about it, but I still think this could have worked if it was willing to abandon the central character.&nbsp; The thing about Flaherty and the documenter/documented is so obvious, like everything in this film, and when a point is made that explicitly, it loses any value (to me).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 February 2010<br />State Legislature<br />Frederick Wiseman, USA, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Whoa boy! A 3 hour and 40 minute cinema verit&eacute; document of the Idaho State Legislature!&nbsp; What could be better?&nbsp; I admit, I've been having trouble falling asleep early so I thought this would be a remedy.&nbsp; It was; I knocked out the first 90 minutes last night and then drifted into a wonderful Idaho slumber which got me back on a normal-people schedule, at least for now.&nbsp; Today I finished the film, which Strohm was reppin', and I understand why.&nbsp; But only in knowing that Adam and I both like intense, dense and difficult viewing experiences.&nbsp; This wasn't actually that hard to watch, just a bit boring, but then it starts to transform your perception of boring and the whole great Fred Wiseman thing hits you.&nbsp; The portrait of the institution, the depiction of little power swings and the way people speak/orate- I think the 'verit&eacute;' camera probably had less of an effect here than in his other films because these politicians, part-time as they may be, are used to speaking in front of observers.&nbsp; And the faces of the many children and teenagers who are visiting the State Legislature are priceless.&nbsp; The reaction shots of other legislators, too, are more than a mere reprieve from the endless series of speeches - they show the reality/humanity of life in the chamber.&nbsp; Boredom, annoyance, and people who are obviously thinking about other things abound.&nbsp; It's interesting how almost every debate depicted here involved government regluation of something.&nbsp; There are a few really memorable (and somewhat hilarious) moments, like the police chief who is testifying about the need to pass laws against 'video voyeuring', and the brilliant, amazing sequence where Senator Davis totally blasts some Terry Bradshaw/Buffalo Bill-looking motherfucker by making him go through every possibly regulated occupation and state whether or not he thinks those professions should be licensed.&nbsp; There were entire parts of this film that I could have done without, but that's what happens in a 220 minute film - this was a bit like watching a Rivette film, only set in Idaho.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />15 February 2010<br />Num&#xE9;ro deux<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1975<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The first original creation of Mieville and Godard was rather stunning in its assertion of a new form of filmmaking.&nbsp; The use of video here is formally quite innovative as it uses multiple screens, with everything crammed into smaller frames, suggesting the way in which fiction is defined by it's creators.&nbsp; The concerns of the narrative are a bit of a departure from the last 8 years or so of Godard's work, looking back within at the personal.&nbsp; I think the idea of feminine space dominates this film, as the apartment where it is set is clearly Sandrine's kingdom though the framing device and the struggles with her children restrict things, making everything a bit cramped.&nbsp; There's also a vey strong focus on the body, both sexually and scatalogically, in a way that I haven't seen from Godard before.&nbsp; I wonder (and I will probably never know) if the title <em>Numero Deux</em> refers to Sandrine's dialogue about shitting with her child.&nbsp; The political themes are still present somewhat, but they are applied to a more general sense of domesticity, almost a textbook 'maturation'.&nbsp; I wish I had a better quality copy of this but I dug it anywway.&nbsp; Godard's 20 minute intro was a bit dull though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 February 2010<br />District 9<br />Neill Blomkamp, South Africa / New Zealand, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Mid-afternoon work break to watch some alien fun!&nbsp; I don't think I can ultimately say that I enjoyed this because I think it's a pretty fucked up film.&nbsp; The very transparent metaphor for racial relationships in South Africa isn't offensive on its own, but it's so confused in what it's trying to say that it ends up reinforcing all of the racist stereotypes it might wish to comment on - but without any trace of irony.&nbsp; The best I can say is that the aliens looked cool and the depiction of slum life is probably fairly realistic, but it's hard to get past the Nigerian baddies, whose monstrous depiction renders the rest of the film's attempt for alien sympathy irrelevant.&nbsp; The last 1/3 of the movie just turned into Robocop, or actually a video game, and I read afterwards that Blomkamp's first efforts were films set in the <em>Halo</em> universe.&nbsp; That's fair enough, but I'll play a video game if I want to experience this world.&nbsp; As another technophiliac jackoff film this fails to even be creepy like a Cronenberg effort would be.&nbsp; The film is so goofy that it's hard to really get a sense of where it's trying to go; the lead character is such a comic figure in the first half that it pushes the whole South African nightmare into some sort of comic book nonsense.&nbsp; I'm surprised more people didn't rally against this film for it's racial confusion (or maybe they did).&nbsp; I'm sure if these were Germans with Jews as the scary prawn-like aliens, this would have been protested voraciously.&nbsp; Also, South African since the fall of Aparthied has been a horrible fuced up mess, with rampant coporate capitalist actually constructing more barriers that the apartheidists could only dream of.&nbsp; And here's a film that implies everything is fine and dandy, except for the aliens, and if anything, it would remain fine and dandy if we just keep them sequestered in a ghetto?&nbsp; Sickening.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 February 2010<br />The Savages<br />Tamara Jenkins, USA, 2007<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>When you have a script as incredibly strong as this, and you put actors as amazing as Laura Linney and PSH in it, you're off to a good start.&nbsp; When you mix this with art direction and cinematography that is beautifully expressing and reserved at the same time, you end up with something damn close to perfect.&nbsp; Really, this film is such an accomplishment, yet it's not flashy or life-changing, so I can see how it slipped under a lot of radars.&nbsp; PSH has mastered the low emotion, depressing middle-aged guy role, and though this film lacks <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>'s pizazz and grandeur, this character (who is essentially the same) is even richer.&nbsp; This film maintains its focus and by the end, nothing has really changed - it doesn't try to make sweeping statements or great dramatic flourishes, but it works in just enough commentary (through the discussion of Brecht) to make it's emotional significances radiate on a multidimensional level.&nbsp; The muted look of Buffalo (and the contrasting exaggeration of Arizona and New York's colour) gives this a really bleak feel, and while it wasn't the most innovative use of lens filters (or whatever cinematographers use), it was so perfect for what Jenkins was trying to do that it transcended the usual effects of overstylised scenery.&nbsp; This is not cinema to tickle the dreamer inside of me, but it certainly speaks to something very real.&nbsp; Extra-special props for casting Chris Partlow, and for showing that not all Nigerians have to be drug-running murderers.&nbsp; Although that is what Chris Partlow does best.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />19 February 2010<br />Zombieland<br />Ruben Fleischer, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I had a bit of a tummyache so I watched this to be lazy and feel better.&nbsp; I grealy enjoyed this for the fun zombie/comedy film that it was.&nbsp; It could have used more zombies, certainly, and Woody Harrelson's character was pretty stupid, but I didn't have to think once in its 87 minutes and for such a mainstream film it packed some good head-bludgeonings in.&nbsp; I'm not a zombie purist who hates comedic zombie movies, nor do I think <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> was anything that it was purported to be, but this was totally good enough.&nbsp; To compare to my (now controversial) views on <em>Distict 9</em>, I found <em>Zombieland</em> to be a far better film precisely because it did not attempt to make an argument; Romero did a good enough job of that in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> (despite his own claims to the contrary) and any sort of commentary would have bogged this lightweight film down.&nbsp; Also, the violence was far better being visceral and close-quartered instead of remote controlled/robot-based.&nbsp; The much-ballyhooed cameo here was handled a bit strangely though - the person's name was revealed before they came on screen (though I had guessed it already from the initials) which definitely softens the impact of the cameo, which, to many people, was <em>the</em> talking point of <em>Zombieland</em>.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />27 February 2010<br />Capitalism: A Love Story<br />Michael Moore, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Michael Moore films are always problematic but I know they are easy to watch so I was glad to dig into this one. &nbsp;I decided to gloss over the things that bother me about his work: his gross oversimplifications, authorial condescension, and propensity to put tear-jerking human interest stories to amplify (or maybe I should say 'distort') the effect of his arguments. &nbsp;I can't overlook his stupid stunts, and this had a few, though they weren't as bad as that awful health care film. &nbsp;Now, tackling capitalism is a tall order and perhaps a bit ambitious even for a filmmaker who thinks so highly of himself as Moore does. &nbsp;I didn't actually expect a Marxist critique and I certainly didn't get one; however, this was probably the most accomplished work of Moore's to-date (besides <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>&nbsp;and <em>Roger and Me</em>, of course). &nbsp;Moore correctly attacked Rubin, Sumners and Geithner and accurately pointed fingers at Goldman Sachs and the Democratic leadership who are responsible for the bailout. &nbsp;The film is perhaps a bit too forgiving of the Obama administration otherwise, though given the time this was made I guess he was being fair to see what steps the administration would take to prevent future economic pillaging (nothing). &nbsp;Obama's election is included for the moment of inspiration that it was, and I still found it moving even though the past year has returned my level of disgust to Bush-administration levels. &nbsp;His portrayal of smaller activist struggles was nice, and the way he contrasted it with the Flint sit-down strikes of the mid-30s was really a nice touch. &nbsp;Though this was more preaching to the converted (apart from the segment about Dead Peasant policies, which I had no idea existed) I thought it did a fair enough job of weaving things together, especially given that his audience does not consist of people who spend 7 hours each day pontificating the contradictions of capitalism like I do. &nbsp;The main contradiction though, that this is a commercial film made within the constraints of a for-profit film industry, is not really addressed. &nbsp;Though Jonas Salk is heroised here for not patenting his polio vaccine, surely Moore could have afforded to release this for free online? &nbsp;I mean, I downloaded it anyway. &nbsp;But maybe instead of targeting "capitalism" - because he doesn't make a single coherent argument here, just a pile of inspiring slogans magnified by emotional impacts -- he should have focused the overall film more acutely on the bailout. &nbsp;The messier edges would be cleaned up (such as the sections praising religion) and the bad history lesson (which simplifies things to "Reagan made things bad", omitting the 30 years of corporate-government lovemaking that led up to Reagan's election, as well as the Clinton-era repeals of Glass-Steagall and other such crimes) could have been left out too. &nbsp;In fact, the entire film could have just been about Glass-Steagall and maybe he could build enough popular momentum to do something about that. But then again, none of Moore's other films have led to any change whatsoever. &nbsp;What really disappointed me was the lame ending, where (overtop of another filmed stunt, a weak one even for Moore's low standards) he declares capitalism to be an evil that must be eradicated -- and then says the system that should replace it is "democracy". &nbsp;Ugh, what a sad copout - particularly when he includes a quote earlier in the film from a <em>WSJ</em>&nbsp;writer and spends the last 1/3 of the film attacking politicians who are democratically elected. &nbsp;If he had any courage, he would have said "socialism" instead of "democracy", because they're not mutually exclusive but socialism would be a more accurate solution (and perhaps the only thing that can provide the 'second blll of rights' that FDR dreamt of). &nbsp;The scenes of the populist rage about the bailout were a nice reminder of the two weeks when I actually felt optimistic about the public's interest in financial reform -- I would have never guessed back then that the whole thing would be co-opted and completely misunderstood by the teaparty idiots. &nbsp;Also i think some sections of this film were influenced by Adam Curtis, but just Curtis' use of archival footage -- not Curtis' ability to actually make intelligent, reasoned arguments.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 March 2010<br />Cold Dog Soup<br />Alan Metter, UK, 1990<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>What an insane movie!&nbsp; This was one of those 80's films (ok, 1990, but a late-80s sensibility) that tries so hard to be 'offbeat'.&nbsp; It resembled <em>After Hours</em>, a lot, only with Randy Quaid bouncing through the whole thing like a man who just doesn't care, and a Matt Damon impersonator trying to carry the lead role.&nbsp; The premise is stupid enough but it careens through a series of increasingly fucked up racial stereotypes (Jews, an African-American street gang, dog-eating Chinese, and finally Voodoo witch doctors) before it jolts to an ending that attempts to project a moral but actually makes no fucking sense at all.&nbsp; It's a train wreck for sure, and a fairly fun one because you get that grimy 1980's New York City, poor direction that actually becomes kinda beautiful in an absurd way, and a sense that you are watching something that was buried for a pretty good reason. Maybe this has a cult audience, I dunno.&nbsp; I would say that I prefer forced 80s "quirky" films to forced 00s "quirky films", but then this got kinda hard to watch about halfway through.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />7 March 2010<br />The Men Who Stare at Goats<br />Grant Heslov, USA / UK, 2009<br />Location: Studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook via external monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>I didn't expect much from a fictionalised adaptation of Jon Ronson's very amusing book and I pretty much got what I expected.&nbsp; Pretty much the only enjoyable aspects of this film were the material that was in the book, but by fictionialising it, it just became something silly.&nbsp; It's interesting that the filmmaker took the attitude that all the psychic powers, etc. were real, because I think the book was far more critical.&nbsp; I really like that Charles Portis novel <em>Master of Atlantis</em> because the big joke is that this huge ridiculous society was built upon something bogus.&nbsp; I think Ronson's book explored the contradiction of these hippie ideas working within the framework of the US army, which is just insane; the film touched on that a little but, but not as much as I would like.&nbsp; This tried to stay generally neutral on the war itself; maybe that was a good idea; <em>Three Kings</em> it was not, as this was one of Clooney's phoned-in characters.&nbsp; Ewan MacGregor is just kind of horrible; it was really Jeff Bridges that was the only redeemable acting performance, though he didn't get that much screen time.&nbsp; Moustaches were good though.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2010<br />Zeitgeist<br />Peter Joseph, USA, 2007<br />Location: studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook via external monitor<br />Company: none<br /><p>This film was a bit of an Internet sensation and I expected it to be some huge theory about mankind, spirituality and history.&nbsp; The first part, once I got past all of the lengthy quotes and iTunes visualiser graphics, was about the utter bullshit that is the Christian religion, citing as much evidence as possible that Jesus Christ was a myth.&nbsp; It was presented in a nerdy, slighty pushy way and I quite enjoyed it.&nbsp; Then I was totally surprised to see that the second part of the film was a 9/11 conspiracy chunk.&nbsp; It was edited together nicely, a lot better than <em>Loose Change</em> (which it references heavily), but it still falls back into truther hysterics.&nbsp; The third part of the film, arguing that the ruling elites are planning to create a One World Government, is standard conspiracy fodder and it was actually a bit boring.&nbsp; I didn't really see the connection between the first part of the film and the other two; it quickly became the expected Bilderberg-hunting game.&nbsp; That this film tried to be philosophical and artistic, but with the aesthetic sensibilities of a video game freak, is maybe it's most memorable aspect.&nbsp; Still, I think I'll watch the sequel (called <em>Addendum</em>) before I start looking for refutations of the 9/11 claims in this.&nbsp; Things like this are guilty pleasures for me even though I am smart enough to avoid their manipulations.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 March 2010<br />London<br />Patrick Keiller, UK, 1994<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Markus Petz<br /><p>My god.&nbsp; I loved this when I first saw it, and I haven't actually watched it since getting the DVD.&nbsp; Watching it again is mesmerising and beautiful, and hilarious as well.&nbsp; It strikes me as an incredible document of a zeitgeist, and of course it makes me immensely miss the UK, even though this is not the UK that I experienced.&nbsp; There are so many things that I could dissect about this film, but I will keep this short because I am sleepy.&nbsp; In a way, this film is like a blog - a journal of 1992, in a way that uses stunning photography to illustrate a personal, yet universal view of a London. It's an angry statement of a frustrated political viewpoint, and I can only draw comparisons to how I felt in 2004 - hopeless, and frustrated.&nbsp; But the narrator and Robinson still approach city life with an incredible joy and weave together a beautiful panorama of romantic/classical allusions and artistic expressions.&nbsp; Despite the cynicism (and brilliant humour, many of the jokes which I did not even get and Markus had to explain as a native Brit), this still achieves a worshipping aspect towards urban pluralism.&nbsp; I felt inspired watching this; I want to run out and start seeing things in a new way.&nbsp; And that's maybe the best endorsement possible for a film.&nbsp; I remember <em>Robinson in Space</em> even more fondly.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />25 March 2010<br />Robinson in Space<br />Patrick Keiller, UK, 1997<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Markus Petz<br /><p>So, so good to see this, even though I had tons of work to do and I was procrastinating heavily.&nbsp; I did write some code while watching, so I won't hate myself too much in the morning.&nbsp; I saw this originally right around the time I had a very memorable seminar on postmodern space, where we looked at some of Lefebvre's writings; this film seemed at the time to be almost like an adaptation of <em>The Production of Space</em>.&nbsp; That book is only quoted once in <em>Robinson in Space</em>, but it's really a Henri Bergson quote that jumped out at me - something about how if we could really see the visible, then art wouldn't need to exist.&nbsp; That's really great, especially when juxtaposed against shot after shot of industrial misery -- and with another quote in the film, that says something like (very paraphrased) "Despite all of the science-fiction fantasticness of Ridley Scott's architecture and future worlds, most people live in places like West Bromwich".&nbsp; Of course, those few stunning shots of Blackpool, with the city asleep and grey, and then the waves hitting the pier - are in some ways more visually mindblowing than a sci-fi futurist could ever dream of. &nbsp; Keiller's portrait of British space truly acheives what only great art can do - it creates a new perspective and a new way of seeing something quotidian.&nbsp; Though it lacks the pervasive humour and political knife of <em>London</em>, <em>RiS</em> is a much denser film.&nbsp; The cinematography is much more rapid-fire, and there aren't as many traditionally beautiful compositions.&nbsp; But about halfway through, the industrial parks and factories around West Bromwich or Middlesbrough start to take on some sort of magic.&nbsp; There's a sheen to them, a way the light reflects off them, or that Keiller will show mist or atmospheric effects.&nbsp; And there's usually some element of greenspace in each shot, so maybe <em>Robinson in Space</em> is defining a new British pastoralism.&nbsp; The final shot of the bridge is so strangely compelling to me (I think I remarked upon it the first time I saw this), but I'm not exactly sure why.&nbsp; It actually saddens me that Keiller didn't make anything after this (except for <em>The Dilapidated Dwelling</em>, which I've never been able to find), because this type of essay film is pretty much my favorite thing there is.&nbsp; The fact that I'm a total geography-obsessed Anglophile has something to do with my love for this, sure, but i really find these two films inspiring.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />12 April 2010<br />The Brothers Bloom<br />Rian Johnson, USA, 2008<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It was a bit irresponsible of me to watch this given how much work I have to do, but I needed a break and it's been ages since I've had time to plop on the couch and watch a film. &nbsp;This was exactly what I needed - pure pleasure for 2 hours, with delightful scene following delightful plot twist following delightful performance. &nbsp;I loved <em>Brick</em>&nbsp;and was curious to see what Johnson would do next; this doesn't ascend to those heights but it has many great moments. &nbsp;There is a pure whimsicality throughout the whole film that is only marred by the occasional dip into hammy dialogue, too cute quirks, or those annoying indie romance trends. &nbsp;By weaving together a lot of influences - this was a good helping of Wes Anderson, a bit of the <em>Oceans</em>&nbsp;movies, some David Mamet and of course <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>&nbsp;- this felt familiar and accessible. &nbsp;This might not be an artistic masterpiece, but it's so undeniably enjoyable that I can't really find anything to complain about. &nbsp;I certainly had no emotional investment in it, so with that distance comes pleasure. &nbsp;I'd like to see <em>Brick</em>&nbsp;again to see how that holds up; I'm not sure if it really was as awesome as I remember it being, or if I just happened to see it when I was in the perfect mood. &nbsp;Which is maybe what I can extend to <em>The Brothers Bloom</em>&nbsp;as well, but, so be it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 April 2010<br />Content<br />Chris Petit, UK, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I've been meaning to check out Chris Petit for a long time, and I should have probably started with <em>Radio On</em>&nbsp;or <em>London Orbital</em>, cause this was a bit disappointing. &nbsp;I know Petit is obsessed with driving, and this was certainly that - 80% of the film's imagery was shot from the window of a car, which I don't have a problem with. &nbsp;What I found disappointing was the essay/narration of this film. &nbsp;There were some really interesting ideas here, but in general it rambled and it seemed really unsure of what it was trying to say. &nbsp;I think Petit was most effective when talking about architecture and the war - criticising New Towns (not that there's anything shocking in that), and illustrating his points with great cinematography. &nbsp;But there was the whole subplot (?) about YouTube and technology, which just seemed awkward, if not stupid. &nbsp;Though how could it not? &nbsp;The musings of the YouTube people seemed banal and preoccupied - which as maybe the point -- and Petit's comments felt like some falsely profound Don Delillo quotes. &nbsp;The use of his own son was effective, and it brought things back to the personal, but I couldn't really follow how it all was supposed to fit together. &nbsp;And the music was mostly awful - tacky Euro-electro ambient pop that only served to distance me further. &nbsp;I sound quite negative here but actually I enjoyed watching this and I intend to check out some older Petit for sure --I think I just had higher expectations for this, which honestly wasn't half as good as an average Jonathan Meades episode.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 May 2010<br />We Live in Public<br />Ondi Timoner, USA, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I expected this to be an essay film on how the Internet has changed our sense of privacy, but it was actually a documentary about Josh Harris, a failed dot-com entrepreneur who (Timoner would lead us to believe) was a brilliant, ahead-of-his-time visionary. &nbsp;Though I enjoyed the film (I was previously unaware of Harris), I don't think I was convinced of any such brilliance. &nbsp;Timoner avoided any serious theorising herself (which maybe was a good thing), but I ended up thinking that the Internet's effect on us (as detailed through the technologies in this film, social networking, etc.) isn't really a surprise; I don't think we've gone beyond what some media theory was saying back in the 60s, except we now have better technology and things are easier to realise. &nbsp;The film avoided any mention of politics, but it was very clear to separate the freewheelin' 90s from the more somber 00s (with 9/11 as the turning point, of course). &nbsp;The reason to think about these things is to try to draw conclusions about society and change, and I think there's a side to the story that wasn't explicitly articulated; Harris and his young Internet millionaires embraced a right-wing, ultra-capitalist mentality that was disguised as great social experiments, though the monetary bottom line still was the reason for everything. &nbsp;This viewpoint is what led to the corruption and avarice of the 00s, though these people weren't there to benefit - just to chase after the next piece of the pie. Harris's own life does unfold as a nearly allegorical story. &nbsp; His stunts seem to make logical sense after each other, and even his foray into apple farming, his pathetic attempt to start a video streaming site in 2005, and his current life in Ethiopia were not even slightly surprising to me. &nbsp;Timoner's style is calculated but smooth, and she often lingers on an interview a few seconds longer to catch a facial tic or subconscious reaction, which helps to tell her story without clouding up the film with too many talking heads. &nbsp;The footage, particularly from the Quiet project, is pretty fascinating and Harris comes off as someone who you instantly feel like you know. &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />12 May 2010<br />Gallivant<br />Andrew Kotting, UK, 1997<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Malcy recommended this when we were talking about British road movies and essay films, and I'm thankful for his guidance cause this was fantastic. &nbsp;This is such a beautiful piece of work and it&nbsp;succeeds&nbsp;on many levels - a travel piece, a visual delight, an insight into disability and family, an exploration of tradition, and more. &nbsp;By traversing the coast of Britain, K&ouml;tting finds the marginalia that is left out of modern Britain; we don't see Morrison's or shopping malls, but rather rocks, cliffs, traditional houses, elderly people, and dialects galore. &nbsp;His grandmother, Gladys, often steals the show, but his daughter is the soul of the film. &nbsp;I&nbsp;realised&nbsp;about 2/3 of the way through that the stylistic techniques he plays with here - overlaid sound, quick-fire images that don't sync up with the dialogue, found footage - echo and accentuate Eden's disability, and puts us into her mind in a manner akin to the first chapter of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. &nbsp;Easy, yes, but not overstated. &nbsp;The various techniques, which could cynically be viewed as a compendium of film-school, was like seeing a goofy kid playing around with his toys. &nbsp;Though I watched a digital print, the&nbsp;graininess&nbsp;of the (often 8mm, i think?) footage was magnificent. &nbsp;And despite the continual small-town portraits, this never descended into schmaltz or overly sentimental BBC documentary-type stuff. &nbsp;Completely beautiful from start to finish, and beauty is something I've been really keen on in art lately.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 May 2010<br />Facs of Life<br />Silvia Maglioni, Graeme Thomson, France, 2009<br />Location: TaiK auditorium<br />Format: video I think, projected in large hall<br />Company: none<br /><p>I went to see Nomadinen Akatamia and Mollecular's joint presentation of this film that is "sorta" about Gilles Deleuze. &nbsp;The filmmakers were present and speaking after the film, but I had to get back in time to relieve Roope from his gallery duties so i bailed after the film. &nbsp;This was a stunning piece of work, though I must admit that I found it intellectually a bit to audacious for me. &nbsp;Structured around eight 'plateaus', this was vaguely about Deleuze, built around some archival footage of his time in Paris 8/Vincennes, but mixed in with contemporary thinkers. &nbsp;Structurally this took the form of some very disconnected quotes and conversations, overlaid on some STUNNING images and some fantastic sound. &nbsp;There's quite a lot of avantgarde sound people involved here - Merzbow being one who has a prominent role -- and a few of the shots were composed so beautifully that I found myself not really listening to the text at times. &nbsp;This is a film that seems to really extend the essay form beyond what people were doing 20 years ago - it probes the relationship of text, image and sound in a really new, innovative way and instead of relying on 'deconstruction', it actually constructs itself around these ideas. &nbsp;It's one to rewatch - I'm not sure if more familiarity with Deleuze would help me or hinder me, because the dialogue seemed so freewheeling at times I can hardly see how it would need a more detailed philosophical grounding to be enjoyed. &nbsp;I could see myself turning to this for inspiration (if I ever get a chance to see it again) and I'm somewhat curious about whatever the Q&amp;A was about, though knowing the crowd it probably went on for ages. &nbsp;Still, great to have a chance to see this.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />31 May 2010<br />Super Mario Bros.<br />Annabel Jankel, Rocky Morton, UK / USA, 1993<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's kinda crazy to me that this film came out in 1993, but I guess that explains why I didn't see it - at 13, I was already a bit too old for this. &nbsp;I loved Super Mario 3 though, which came out in '91, but I think at 13 I was getting interested in more important things like music. &nbsp;To commemorate Dennis Hopper's passing, this was a good choice, as it balances between his hack/hammy work and the bits of genius that scatter his career. &nbsp;I think the real reason this film sucks is because the budget was so low. &nbsp;As an attempt to graft a video game fantasy world onto a film, it's actually not that bad - and given that I subsisted on a diet of Mario from the age of 6, it wouldn't take a whole lot. &nbsp;But they musta blown all the cash on getting Hoskins, Hopper and Leguziamo because <em>most of this film does not use sync sound</em>. &nbsp;I'd expect a bit of ADR in a film that is mostly action and effects-based, but this was shocking - even the interior scenes were always spoken with a character's back to the camera. &nbsp;I thought this would be a much more stereotypical portrayal of Italian-Americans, but since the lead roles were played by a Brit and a Puerto Rican, it was just kinda bizarre. &nbsp;Mario's trashy Brooklyn girlfriend I guess was a bit Jersey Shore, but being that this was a kids movie it didn't get too out of hand. &nbsp;Weird choice of Adam Strohm's favourite character actor, Richard Edson, as one of the Hammer Bros -- at least, I think that's what they were supposed to be despite being cousins and not having hammers. &nbsp;I did doze off for about ten minutes in the middle but I think that's for the better. &nbsp;Roxette provide a limp song that gets top billing during the credits and there's a few interesting casting choices (Don Lake! &nbsp;Plus Mojo Nixon as Toad, though it's not the Toad I'm used to). &nbsp;I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what certain aspects of the video game the various sets and characters were referencing, but I think this violates the continuity of the Nintendo Universe somewhat. &nbsp;Actually, the more I think about it, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>&nbsp;was actually pretty good, for what it was. &nbsp;With some money it woulda been great, but it certainly didn't lack in imagination. &nbsp;Any film that features Bob Hoskins biting a meteorite out of a African-American giantess's cleavage has to be somewhat redeemable, right? &nbsp;Though even Nintendo themselves have disowned it. &nbsp;I did particularly like when Hoskins and Leguiziamo (who are pretty far apart in age to be convincing as brothers) put on these snazzy yellow and red suits and went clubbing. &nbsp;But enough positives - at no point did either Mario brother actually eat a mushroom, become Super, and stomp on any bad guys. &nbsp;There were the weird boots things which are kinda in Mario 3, but they removed all of the most vital characteristics of the game - no punching bricks, the gold coins are only mentioned, no warp zones (unless you count the interdimensional gateway), no TURTLES (maybe they were afraid of being too simliar to TMNT?), and most of all no lines about the princess being in another castle. &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />31 May 2010<br />Leap of Faith<br />Richard Pearce, USA, 1992<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>A fairly surprising performance from Steve Martin, as this was significantly less comedy than I thought it would be. &nbsp;Debra Winger really becomes the focal point in her relationship with Liam Neeson, who isn't very believable as a small-town Kansas sheriff since his accent keeps bleeding through. &nbsp;When Martin does the preacher revival bits, he's allowed to shine, but those parts seem to jar with the otherwise serious emotional drama at play. &nbsp;There's some great dustbowl photography but the film fails because it lays things on a bit too thick; besides Neeson's character being named Braverman, the small-town residents never manage to transcend stereotypes. &nbsp;Though the filmmakers clearly have sympathy with them, they really are portrayed as simple and god-fearing, and the dramatic turn at the end of the film is just over the top. &nbsp;Still, Martin is such a talent that he (and Winger) redeem this otherwise rote screenplay.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2010<br />Midnight Run<br />Martin Brest, USA, 1988<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Recent chatter on PBT + wanting to procrastinate today made me decide to revisit this. &nbsp;I probably first saw this when I was ten, but it's amazing how much of it I remember. &nbsp;I must have seen some of it on TV at some later point. &nbsp;Charles Grodin is a lot more 'serious' than I remember him being in this, as I thought it was much more of an odd couple/buddy film than it actually was. &nbsp;I still laughed pretty much every time he opened his mouth (and often when he didn't), and he was a good counterpart to Deniro's rather overwrought character, who had really bad humorous lines. &nbsp;Philip Baker Hall was a nice (though superfluous) small surprise and the 80s baddies, with weirdly-patterned jumpers and Italian moustaches, were perfect. &nbsp;It is what it is, <em>Midnight Run</em>, but it's amazingly fun to watch. &nbsp;Danny Elfman's score is totally 80s-tastic as well.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2010<br />L.A. Confidential<br />Curtis Hanson, USA, 1997<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was an absolutely fantastic film that I have for some reason never seen. &nbsp;It was pretty much flawless in its construct and execution, and I don't really have any more to say about it.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 June 2010<br />Kick-Ass<br />Matthew Vaughn, USA / UK, 2010<br />Location: Cabin 7125, deck 7, DFDS Seaways Princess of Norway ferry<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p>For a second teenage-orientated (but not really) film in one evening, I sampled the popular <em>Kick-Ass</em>, which I downloaded awhile back and still had on my laptop. &nbsp;I started off enjoying the narrative, which was lighthearted, genuinely funny at times, and had McLovin in it. &nbsp;But when the extreme violence and gore kicked in, I found myself questioning this film (like I've questioned so many other super-violent action films recently). &nbsp;What's wrong with me? &nbsp;Am I getting too old or too uptight? &nbsp;I still maintain that I take violence very very seriously, and I still LOVE to see it done right in cinema - but&nbsp;<em>Inglorious Basterds</em>&nbsp;is like <em>Straw Dogs</em>&nbsp;compared to this. &nbsp;This has the same type of over-the-top, Zach Snyder-esque violence that <em>Watchmen</em>&nbsp;has, though while <em>Watchmen </em>uses that violence to hit you in the stomach (and further it's deconstruction of the whole super-hero thing, giving a grounded, visceral impact to what can easily be confused as a fairytale), <em>Kick-Ass </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">j</span>ust enjoys the gore without any artistic purpose whatsoever. &nbsp;I'm not troubled by the fact that it's an 11-year old girl doing most of the killing, nor by the film's&nbsp;unrepentant&nbsp;glorification of it - I guess I accepted this to be morally bankrupt before the blood really started flying. &nbsp;I guess I'm just troubled by how it actually bogged down the film and was unimaginative. &nbsp;Something like <em>Superjail<span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;I dig, which is even more violent (and actually a cartoon); this is, I dunno, just going to get kids excited for all the wrong reasons. &nbsp;Like </span>Youth in Revolt</em>, which I also watched before this, this is yet another film basically about a teenager trying to get laid, though that at least becomes irrelevant rather quickly. &nbsp;I can't even imagine how unbearable the sequel will be.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 June 2010<br />Youth in Revolt<br />Miguel Arteta, USA, 2009<br />Location: Cabin 7125, deck 7, DFDS Seaways Princess of Norway ferry<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p><em>Youth in Revolt</em>&nbsp;sorta slipped under the radar for me; I remember seeing a trailer for it ages ago, and just assumed it hadn't come out yet. &nbsp;I think it actually came and went rather quickly, but it was exactly what I needed to cap off a crazy 2 days of driving and hanging out with horny teengers. &nbsp;So, another film about a horny teenager, with Michael Cera playing the role he always plays, and it following the same plot device as <em>Superbad</em>, <em>American Pie</em>, and, well, everything. &nbsp;But! &nbsp;I really liked this. &nbsp;The highbrow jokes were good but not overdone, and of course it's hard not to enjoy Zach G, Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi, and Fred Willard in anything. &nbsp;I would maybe even go as far as to say this is the definitive Michael Cera movie, as it actually confronts his typical awkward character head-on. &nbsp;Though some of it bombs, a few sequences had me rolling on the floor laughing, really --&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;when he crashes his Dad's car into the water. &nbsp;This went beyond the light entertainment I was craving and I would maybe even watch it again, and recommend it. &nbsp;Plus it was directed by the guy who made <em>Chuck &amp; Buck</em>, a wonderfully uncomfortable film (and not Mikel Arteta, the vastly underrated Everton midfielder).</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 July 2010<br />Greenberg<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>The trailers for this had me thinking it was Baumbach making a blatant stab at commercial comedy, but it really quickly revealed itself to be more of what he does well, albeit with a more pronounced influence of Robert Altman and 1970's filmmaking in general. &nbsp;Or maybe that is just an obvious comparison for the way <em>Greenberg</em>&nbsp;is set in Los Angeles, with a&nbsp;devilishly&nbsp;overlapping soundtrack and occasionally freewheeling cinematography. &nbsp;Wow, what a film this was - the third consecutive totally great film by this guy. &nbsp;This wasn't as brutal as <em>Margot</em>, not as funny as <em>Squid</em>&nbsp;- I guess it occupies a nice intermediary territory, and it was fun to watch just after reading Daniel Clowes' latest graphic novel, which had a similar misanthropic vein. &nbsp;This is a film that utterly pushes Ben Stiller to his limits as a dramatic actor, and it's almost too much for him, yet I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. &nbsp;The comedic nuances are something that he is a master of, and if this isn't a career-defining role, then I don't know what is. &nbsp;Greta Garwig was also stunning and the film continually surprised me with where it was going, yet never took too sudden of a turn, never went for cheap laughs, and never got too concerned with resolution. &nbsp;Plus, a great soundtrack. &nbsp;Jennifer Jason Leigh cowrote this and her brief role was brilliant; after seeing <em>Margot</em>, which I thought was an Oscar-worthy performance from her, I've become somewhat of a fan. &nbsp;This will be watched again.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2010<br />Hot Tub Time Machine<br />Steve Pink, Canada / USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>What an absolutely horrendous pile of shit. &nbsp;I don't know I expected <em>Hot Tub Time Machine</em>&nbsp;to be good -- well, I didn't. &nbsp;But I expected it to at least be funny. I laughed 3 or 4 times during this, but mostly just found it to be a painful exercise in sexism, homophobia, and unimaginative setups. &nbsp;Crispin Glover and Chevy Chase were the highlights, but not because of their actual performances - just because it was Crispin Glover and Chevy Chase. &nbsp;They were utterly wasted on this script though, and this is the final nail in the coffin of Jon Cusack (artistically). &nbsp;The anachronisms weren't even done well - they could have been a little more careful with the reconstructed 1986 world, and also they could have probably made some of the jokes funny instead of just being stupid macho posturing. &nbsp;All of the characters were unlikeable, and the ones that were supposed to be, like Rob Corddry, weren't even&nbsp;cleverly&nbsp;unlikeable. &nbsp;<em>Primer</em>&nbsp;this was not, but it wasn't even <em>Timecrimes</em>, or even <em>Back to the Future</em>. &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />11 July 2010<br />Campana del infierno, La<br />Claudio Guer&#237;n / Juan Antonio Bardem, Spain / France, 1973<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I borrowed this DVD from David Keenan about 3 years ago and forgot to ever watch it. &nbsp;I realised I still had it, and they had no idea who they had lent it to, and really wanted it back. &nbsp;Which is good motivation to finally watch this, a bizarre, insane masterpiece from the same cross-genre madness as <em>Man Woman and Beast</em>&nbsp;and <em>A Quiet Place in the Country</em>. &nbsp;<em>A Bell from Hell</em>&nbsp;is incredibly restrained, always teasing with it's suggestion of extreme brutality, but apart from a few animal slaughter scenes, this doesn't go for the squeamish vein. &nbsp;Which is appropriate enough -- this is a film about images,&nbsp;illusion&nbsp;and artifice, and it teases the viewer through a series of impeccably constructed cinematographic moments, and some stunning trickery that is then laid bare in the confines of the story. &nbsp;The technological tools that the main character uses are somewhat silly, but when contrasted with the muted brown/grey colours of the old-world scenery, they take this film into an even stranger area. &nbsp;The underlying sexual psychosis is here (just like in the other two films mentioned above) though this is not explored quite as darkly as I would have liked. &nbsp;Still, there's nothing quite like <em>A Bell from Hell</em>, and I shouldn't have waited so long to explore this beast.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 July 2010<br />Heat<br />Michael Mann, USA, 1995<br />Location: Conference room A, 6th floor, Tallink Superfast VII ferry<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p>This mid-90's cops and robbers film tries to be epic, but manages to wear out it's welcome about 30 minutes before the end. &nbsp;Still, as the genre goes, there are some great set pieces; the big shootout in the middle is fun, and the coffee scene between Pacino and DeNiro is pretty wonderful. &nbsp;But why are these two considered to be such masterful actors? &nbsp;I had trouble choking back laughter at some of it. &nbsp;Pacino's character is amazingly ridiculous, prone to random nonsensical outbursts and making me think of Rich Fulcher on <em>The Mighty Boosh</em>, or Bobcat Goldwaith. &nbsp;The domestic/romance angles are what dragged this down - and also the way every tough male character would flip out and yell and smash something in the exact same way. &nbsp;Humanity may not be Michael Mann's strong suit, but he wove a pretty good plot and the action scenes were good enough. &nbsp;This helped to pass a very long, very dull ferry trip.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />14 July 2010<br />War<br />Philip G. Atwell, USA, 2007<br />Location: Conference room A, 6th floor, Tallink Superfast VII ferry<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br /><p>I figured Jason Statham is always good to make the pain go away, and this successfully allowed for 1 hr and 45 minutes of my 29-hour ferry trip to pass slightly less bored. &nbsp;Though this was actually a very boring film - a work of Asian fetishism structured around some insanely dull fight sequences and a horrible storyline with an unimaginative plot and other attributes. &nbsp;I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but I wouldn't recommend a lot of the crap I've been watching lately.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 July 2010<br />The Prestige<br />Christopher Nolan, USA / UK, 2006<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>This is a kinda weird story that if you think about it, is actually pretty stupid. &nbsp;But Nolan knows how to make compelling films and this certainly is the case - even at 130 minutes, I didn't get too bored. &nbsp;<em>The Prestige</em>&nbsp;is a slow starter, and I'm getting kinda sick of that Tory-loving Michael Caine and his Cockney drawl. &nbsp;But it was nice to see Bale playing an Englishman and Jackman as an American, and I think after <em>The Fountain</em>, I like Jackman somewhat. &nbsp;This reminded me of <em>The Fountain</em>, actually, but I can't really see why besides the Jackman-obsession aspect and the art direction, though this was a period piece and <em>The Fountain</em>&nbsp;takes place in the future. &nbsp;I would like to see more films in the Tesla-spolitation genre, though. &nbsp;I also thought this reminded me of Bergman's <em>Magician</em>, til I realised that I never actually saw that film. &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />24 July 2010<br />Comment &#xE7;a va?<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Anne-Marie Mi&#xE9;ville, France, 1978<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's been ages since I last watched a Godard film, though I haven't given up on my pledge to see all of his feature-length fllms in chronological order -- I just got sidetracked by the last few months of busyness, and not necessarily wanting to watch Godard when I've had free time for cinema. &nbsp;This is one of those films that is hard to categorise - it's not a documentary or essay strictly, but it's hardly fictional either. &nbsp;It's another collaboration with Mi&eacute;ville, from the Son et Image period, and again mixes film and video with primitive text overlays and still photography. &nbsp;The subject matter of this film follows pretty logically from the last ten or so films that I've watched, though with some more functional concerns, mainly that of the role of the media itself in describing what it reflects upon. &nbsp;This goes through the uprising in mid-70s Portugal, the death of Franco, and other timely topics, and if anything has much less of a focus on domesticity and the everyday that was saw in <em>Num&eacute;ro Deux</em>. &nbsp;The two main characters are just voices to speak Godard's thoughts, which I'm used to be now, but they spoke from an older, more uncommitted stance. &nbsp;I don't think this is one I'd definitely watch again, though it's a certainly a fine film and probably a good document of his ideas at this time, particularly since he had less output. &nbsp;The dissection of magazine advertising was quite nice, though it made me long for the colourful deconstructions of his earlier films, such as <em>La Chinoise</em>&nbsp;- the imagery here was muted and inactive, which we perhaps the point.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />26 July 2010<br />Mr. Jealousy<br />Noah Baumbach, USA, 1997<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>It was far too hot to work this afternoon so I figured I'd lay back in the dark and watch a film until it cooled off enough inside my studio. &nbsp;<em>Mr. Jealousy</em>&nbsp;is an early Noah Baumbach film I figured I should check out since I love pretty much everything else I've seen by him. &nbsp;This definitely felt more like training wheels, and served as a spiritual sequel to <em>Kicking and Screaming</em>&nbsp;with perhaps a bit more ambitious of an approach to art direction and narrative quirkyness. &nbsp;While I certainly enjoyed this film, it is definitely my least favourite Baumbach films -- the characters felt obvious, and while I enjoyed seeing Jasper and other <em>K&amp;S</em>&nbsp;people, Eric Stoltz isn't the most compelling lead actor for me. &nbsp;The difference between this and <em>Margot</em>&nbsp;or <em>Greenberg</em>&nbsp;is staggering. &nbsp;This actually felt like a later Woody Allen movie minus the neurotic Jewishness. &nbsp;I certainly was okay with Baumbach's New York, which was bold, safe and colourful if not particularly accurate, and I feel like he refined that vision a bit in <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>&nbsp;(though with the additional benefit of period veneer). &nbsp;The narrator was clunky, though I usually don't mind narrators -- sometimes narrators are an excuse for poor writing, and maybe this was a bit of a crutch. &nbsp;And the denoument was somewhat of a letdown after all of the buildup. &nbsp;But still, I enjoyed this enough and I guess I should watch <em>Highball</em>&nbsp;next. &nbsp;This period of late-90s independent film is so interesting because of it's preoccupations and relative timidity; it feels like the Apatow crowd had seized on the insecurities of the characters in these films, but added tons of raunchy dick jokes and other misogyny. &nbsp;I certainly laugh more at the newer approach but maybe this isn't so good for my soul.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />28 July 2010<br />Mr. Nobody<br />Jaco Van Dormael, Canada / Belgium / France/ Germany, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I watched the 'extended' version of this, which is a lot of Jared Leto. &nbsp;But even still there was something remarkable about this, though I'm left with contradictory feelings overall. &nbsp;Visually, this was great - some of the surrealist/dream sequences, though highly influenced by <em>Cremaster</em>, were fantastic. &nbsp;And <em>Mr. Nobody</em>, while it may hit you over the head with it's bizarre melting parallel forking paths and disjointed timeline, doesn't overdo it on these surreal/fantasy scenes. &nbsp;if anything, it's the overly long teenage melodrama that wears itself thin, though it reveals to have a reason. &nbsp;And the sheer pleasure of trying to figure things out kept me going through the first half. &nbsp;This is kinda like that <em>Possible Worlds</em>&nbsp;film, just done better and with a much bigger budget. &nbsp;I don't know that I'd ever sit through this again (certainly not the extended cut), though I'd be curious to see what was excised for the theatrical release. &nbsp;When it's all over I was kinda wondering "What was the point?", and also it feels very Western in the way that the individual is the focus of everything - a classic tale, really, just filtered through a few prisms. &nbsp;Thematically, the whole Tarkovsky/water influence was laid on so thick that I'm not actually sure it served any purpose except to show the filmmaker's influences (much like the scene that is a tribute to <em>A Zed and Two Noughts</em>). &nbsp;But, yeah, cool film, great visuals, and the attention to detail was really nice.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />29 July 2010<br />Four Lions<br />Christopher Morris, UK, 2010<br />Location: FinnKino, Tennispalatsi, Kamppi, Helsinki<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Tara<br /><p>Paid for Tara's ticket. &nbsp;We were gonna go see <em>Inception</em>&nbsp;but then I saw this was playing, so that decision was a no-brainer! &nbsp;I always try to avoid reading lots of criticism about things I want to see before I see them, but I couldn't resist with <em>Four Lions. </em>The coverage was so mixed that my expectations were somewhat low too. &nbsp;I mean, could Chris Morris really pull this off? &nbsp;Surprise - this was awesome! &nbsp;I think he does mange to navigate some difficult fucking territory here. &nbsp;Despite all the laughs, this was a complex film (though I wonder if I might be giving him a free pass on some&nbsp;characterisations&nbsp;that I maybe wouldn't allow to other filmmakers, like the <em>District 9</em>&nbsp;joker). &nbsp;Making a film about the lighter side of Islamic terrorism is a dangerous proposition, and I'd like to think Morris has managed to avoid getting a Fatwa dropped on him. &nbsp;But probably not, because this is a complicated film with a lot of nuance despite the slapstick insanity, and the types of people that kill because their faith was insulted aren't the types to get complicated nuances. &nbsp;Morris (and this is co-written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who have a near-perfect track record) could have gone for pure laughs or pure commentary, but doesn't - he goes for both. &nbsp;It's not even about working out a balance between the two approaches - it's full-steam ahead with both, relentlessly. &nbsp;Because we do spend some time with Omar's family, the human element is&nbsp;emphasised&nbsp;and the denouement &nbsp;is like a punch in the stomach. &nbsp;The contradictions of extreme religious belief and the characters' immersion into pop culture is probably the most provocative aspect of <em>Four Lions</em>&nbsp;overall, as I don't need a dissection of what's wrong with Islam or a critique of counterterrorism strategies (which actually, this film lacked). &nbsp;Actually, if you pair this with <em>In the Loop</em>, you'd have pretty much captured both sides of the issue (and with the same writers) -- so I hope these will end up as a double feature somewhere, someday. &nbsp;Ultimately, this film was totally fucking hilarious - I haven't laughed at a movie so much since, well, <em>In the Loop</em>, and I think it will have lots of rewatch value. &nbsp;Setting it in Sheffield was a nice touch, and the violence is done right. &nbsp;I've written on PBT a lot about my ever-changing feelings regarding cinema violence, usually stating that it has to hit hard and be meaningful, not just cartoonish. I think this succeeds in avoiding cartoonish killing (despite the costumes at the end, which would be literal) and if that makes the film a bit more difficult to work out, ethically and humorously, it was a valuable tradeoff.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 July 2010<br />Every Man for Himself<br />Jean-Luc Godard, FranceAustriaWest GermanySwitzerland, 1980<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Finally, I've arrived at Godard's "return to form" -- the period where he began making so-called conventional cinema again. &nbsp;The thing is, <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie) </em>is only conventional in the way it focuses on relationships, love, sex and personal interactions -- the standard material for French cinema, right? -- and leave the fascination with politics behind. &nbsp;But stylistically, Godard and Mi&eacute;ville are still fascinated by the forms of sound and image, as this film plays liberally with both. &nbsp;The slow-mo scenes threw me at first because I thought my .avi file was corrupted, but they're used to shock the viewer into a form of observation at crucial points of the film. &nbsp;The sound experimentation I found less easy to read, but this overall was an 'easy' film to watch. &nbsp;The storyline was sorta fragmented, but interesting; the character of Paul was such a monster that it was hard not to hate him, and the two main female characters were like forces orbiting around the same disasterous planet. &nbsp;Again, Godard is investigating prostitution - maybe this is another reason why this is seen as a return to form, being so similar to <em>Vivre sa vie</em>&nbsp;or <em>Deux ou trois choses</em>. &nbsp;This is maybe the anti-<em>Week End</em>, as it bookends his political period and looks at "bourgeoisie" principles like love and marriage. &nbsp;But instead of having utter contempt for society like in 1967, the 1980 Godard is accepting of these lives. &nbsp;I wouldn't say he's necessarily sympathetic - I think there's a resigned cynicism in <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie)</em>&nbsp;which makes sense since it's translated in English as "Every Man for Himself" -- what better way to ring in the 1980s?</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 August 2010<br />Wall Street<br />Oliver Stone, USA, 1987<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I never saw this and for some reason had the urge - I think I subconsciously heard about the sequel and wanted to catch up. &nbsp;I didn't think this was a good movie, apart from the humour in watching Michael Douglas act in a ridiculous manner, but you can probably get that in a lot of other films. The rise and fall arc was predictable and Stone's usual heavy-handedness was a bit muddled here. &nbsp;For a film released at the peak of 1980s culture, I sort of expected a somewhat sharper critique. &nbsp;I imagine a sequel could be better, given the changes in financial market free-for-alls since 1987, but with Shia LaBouf in the lead role I'm not exactly expecting much.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2010<br />Godard&#x27;s Passion<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 1982<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br /><p>Wow, what an absolutely massive, beautiful, layered masterpiece. &nbsp;I guess I'm back on the Godard kick - I thought about halfway through this how I am no longer sick of Godard, though I didn't realise that I had gotten sick of him until I realised I wasn't anymore. &nbsp;If that makes any sense. &nbsp;This is an insanely ambitious work that is marked most notably by the return of Raoul Cotard to the cinematographer's chair, and oh my, has he been missed. &nbsp;The many layers at work here unfold throughout absolutely spellbinding, grandiose scenery, as the film within the film reconstructs the classics of Western painting. &nbsp;This exploration of the relationship between classical and contemporary art is probably meant to be denigrated by the unfolding complexity of the other characters - Isabelle and Hannah, reprising the two-women scenarios of <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie)</em>, Michel Piccoli and his wife, the various crew members, and the factory workers. &nbsp;The mundane is photographed with the same loving care, and this becomes a democratic approach to art. &nbsp;<em>Passion</em>&nbsp;is the most natural weaving of the many concerns explored over the previous decade of Godard's work. &nbsp;The role of labour is given more than lip service by Isabelle's factory&nbsp;organising; the political engagement, so often before seen as&nbsp;fractious&nbsp;and inconclusive, is just right. &nbsp;The combination of sound and image is here portrayed with elaborate artifice; the soundtrack of Mozart and Beethoven lends the film a highbrow air but it's meant to be tongue-in-cheek, I think. &nbsp;We have gotten about as far away from the verit&eacute; style he used over te previous 14 years, and the video experiments of the Sonimage period. &nbsp;This is cinema, on gloriously bold Coutard-drenched 35mm, and every shot is immaculately conceived. &nbsp;It's rivaled in sheer beauty by only <em>Contempt</em>&nbsp;and <em>Deux ou trois choses</em>&nbsp;in his past work. &nbsp;It's fitting that we open with <em>The Night Watch</em>, because Coutard's mastery of light is the boldest thing I've seen this side of Vierny/Greenaway. &nbsp;The non-painting scenes are every bit as rich; we see the sweat on Isabelle Huppert's face, and the shadows best that of a film noir (particularly the scene in the staircase of the hotel/apartment, which is an aesthetic playground, though minimalist). &nbsp;Despite these insanely ornate tracking shots and the fluid, languid drawing of these long scenes, something about this film is tight and almost claustrophobic. &nbsp;Maybe it's the exposed mechanics of cinema - tracking shots of tracking shots, rather than just a metafictional gimmick, allow a greater sense of stage while showing off the totality of Godard's artistic compositions. &nbsp;The running time is quite economical, and the dramatic interplay we see is certainly truncated, but that's part of what makes this so mysterious and compelling -- though I don't think it can be fully unraveled.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 August 2010<br />Strong Medicine<br />Richard Foreman, USA, 1981<br />Location: MoKS basement, Mooste, Estonia<br />Format: DivX projected on screen<br />Company: 'Miscellaneous Expertise' participants<br /><p>This was the only feature-length film that we screened it its entirety during the week that we ran the workshop, so because I only list feature-length films on PBT, this is the only one that will occur here. &nbsp;The quote from Foreman, which somewhat inspired the workshop, was that he only likes to watch the first ten minutes of any film -- before the characters' motivations are full developed. &nbsp;'Strong Medecine' attempts to extend that effect over a whole film, and does so in a brutally uncompromising manner. &nbsp;While it appears to be loaded with non-sequiturs and 'what the fuck' moments, there's a definite logic to the madness. &nbsp;Foreman isn't so much an absurdist as a Beckett-style experimentalist, and his seemingly incongruous bits of dialogue are rather impressionistic. &nbsp;Though there are distinctly cinematic elements such as montage here, you can see how this is descended from a theatre producer. &nbsp;The overall effect is constantly jarring, but one that eventually begins to convey a psychological portrait unlike anything I've ever really seen. &nbsp;<em>A Woman Under the Influence</em>&nbsp;is powerful, yet it remains a scene told from our point of reference. &nbsp;<em>Strong Medecine</em>&nbsp;is a far more internalised portrayal of mental torment, though that's actually a really reductive reading. &nbsp;What I liked was how I stopped trying to read anything after awhile and let myself be carried by the style. I'm kind of glad or the washed-out video print and relatively tame cinematography - though in the hands of a visual innovator, this could have been even more far out, jaw-dropping visuals might have detracted from the script.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />3 September 2010<br />First Name: Carmen<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1983<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Raoul Coutard claims this is his favourite Godard film, which sounds shocking at first, but if you think about it, it has a little bit of everything that Godard does well: weirdly detached yet cool guns n' gangsters, claustrophobically shot scenes of domestic eroticism, and the bizarrely sideways use of music and sound. &nbsp;Isabelle Adjani was supposed to be in this but pulled out, leaving Maruschka Detmers, and I'm not complaining cause there's been few films I've ever seen to have such a female sexual presence. &nbsp;Godard plays a weird caricature of himself - creepy, strung out, and sputtering nonsensical quotes about Mao and labour -- it's pretty funny and I wonder how much he manipulated his physical appearance or if that's just what he looked like. &nbsp;This is a more simple and smaller film than <em>Passion</em>&nbsp;but every bit as radiant - all of these 80s Godard films so far have just burst with bright, lively colours. &nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 September 2010<br />Hail Mary<br />Jean-Luc Godard, FranceSwitzerlandUK, 1985<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Godard's famously controversial recreation of the Jesus birth myth was nothing to get controversial about, if you ask me. &nbsp;If anything it was a bit boring, feeling like a retreat to the self-absorbed political films but without the political content. &nbsp;I was curious to see how Godard would address religion, which is something he's rarely commented on in his work. &nbsp;The portrayal of 80s French teenagers is less than convincing, and I found myself waiting for it to be over. &nbsp;This was paired with Mi&eacute;ville's <em>Le Livre de Marie</em>&nbsp;at the beginning, which was pretty excellent in comparison. &nbsp;I always thought Mi&eacute;ville brought the technological innovation and heavy&nbsp;interdisciplinary&nbsp;approach to the SonImage films, but this was a really straight arthouse short that viewed a divorce from the eyes of a child. &nbsp;I was really impressed with how human this film was; the child actress was realistically childlike and detached, yet incredibly moving in her performance. &nbsp;Maybe this precedes the Godard film because it's supposed to be the same girl - that's logical enough.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 September 2010<br />Get Him to the Greek<br />Nicholas Stoller, USA, 2010<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Hmmm. This was a slightly above-average bromance/buddy movie. I say above average because I did laugh a bit, but ultimately it wasn't particularly compelling or original. &nbsp;This was by-the-books, even down to the bit Aziz Ansari part, the crazy/angry black guy (which Puff Daddy was fine at, but it really could have been almost any black comic) and the rote happy ending. &nbsp;I suppose this was slightly less misogynistic than most films in the genre. &nbsp;John A. Hill is a good lead (with quite a few vomit scenes) and I do find Russell Brand funny, but this was nothing out of the ordinary. &nbsp;It is nice they made Brand's character an archetype instead of a straight-up parody of 90's britpop people, and the songs were wonderfully terrible but without being overly ha-ha. It's weird that Elisabeth Moss plays pretty much the exact same character Peggy's become on this season of <em>Mad Men</em>. &nbsp;It's such a shame she's a Scientologist. &nbsp;Funniest part: Paul Krugman.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 October 2010<br />Inception<br />Christopher Nolan, USA / UK, 2010<br />Location: Bristol theatre<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: none<br /><p>I'm always late to the party though this actually did get released here back in the summer when everyone else saw it. &nbsp;I'm glad I caught this in a cinema while it was still playing - I got to enjoy a mostly empty theatre (though those who were there were clustered in the same few rows of the balcony with me) and see some of these visuals on the 'big screen'. &nbsp;And the Bristol is probably the nicest theatre in town. &nbsp;I don't know if I have much to add to the standard reviews/criticism of <em>Inception</em>. &nbsp;Visually impressive, fun plot unraveling, sure, but a little bit cold. &nbsp;I think this ranks up with the best non-Philip K Dick adaptations, not because of the plot/logic (which is actually far more simple than something like <em>Palmer Eldritch</em>&nbsp;or <em>Ubik</em>) but because of the absolutely terrible acting. &nbsp;Seriously, Leonardo DiCaprio is considered one of the biggest movie stars around? &nbsp;What is possibly redeemable about him? &nbsp;There were a few points when I actually laughed out loud at how hammy the acting was. &nbsp;But Nolan isn't really an actor's director, is he? &nbsp;This story provided a great framework for him to blow shit up and have chase scenes without need for explanation. &nbsp;I really respect Nolan's ambition (even if I criticised <em>The Dark Knight</em>&nbsp;for it) but I think I prefer him when he holds back a bit. &nbsp;If this is the <em>Dark Knight </em>to <em>The Prestige</em>'s <em>Batman Begins</em>&nbsp;(does that make any sense) then I'm still a bigger fan of <em>The Prestige</em>. &nbsp;It's interesting that both of those films seems to be investigating the fabric of moviemaking itself through their investigations of illusion. &nbsp;This was light on the philosophy, thank God, after <em>Dark Knight's</em>&nbsp;heavyhandedness, and Ellen Page was a surprising bright spot. &nbsp;If there's one thing I'll say -- Nolan has proved he can make massive, awe-inspiring Hollywood films in a smarter and more accomplished way than just about anyone else. &nbsp;Whatever the Batman films' flaws were, they still felt like they were raising the bar a bit. &nbsp;There was something a bit sloppy about <em>Inception</em>&nbsp;- like it just was missing something, which I can't quite explain. &nbsp;It didn't feel as long as his other films though (and maybe it wasn't) so I'm glad I dropped the cash on this and wasted a night.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />16 October 2010<br />Exit Through the Gift Shop<br />Banksy, USA / UK, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>This documentary was nothing like I expected it to be, and ultimately I think I was pretty impressed with it. &nbsp;Banksy's film explores a lot of ideas such as the notion that you have to 'pay your dues', the overall questioning of what is artistic talent, and the nature of documenting everything (cough, PBT, cough). &nbsp;Because the style was so insanely user-friendly - with basic narration that even your grandmother could follow -- it didn't let its style get in the way of its substance. &nbsp;The problematic relationship of so-called 'street art' to the captialist art machine is something that is certainly a subtext throughout the film, though Banksy holds back from overtly critiquing it (no doubt because of his own profiting). &nbsp;As someone who's really not impressed by the types of art depicted in this film, i was able to just watch this as a pure documentary and thankfully I didnt feel like my own value judgements were being countered - there's no time when I felt like I was being told that this was amazing, visionary art. &nbsp;Banksy, to me, is a provocative graphic designer and doesn't really inflect his artwork with much sense of mystery of the sublime, which is echoed in the film's style as well. &nbsp;But, again, I somewhat liked that because I could just take it for what it is. &nbsp;And if Mr. Brainwash is a hoax (which is probably is), I guess that's impressive in how huge and masterful it is, but really, that doesn't even matter.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 October 2010<br />Détective<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 1985<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br /><p>Godard's big-name detective movie is one of the first Godard films in recent memory that I felt like it was a chore to finish. &nbsp;The plot was a bit of a joke, so I couldn't contain my interest. &nbsp;I think most of the point of this film was that he made it with Nathalie Baye and Johnny Halliday, who were big stars that were married to each other, so it's probably much more significant if I was well-versed in mid-80s French pop culture. &nbsp;However successful this may have possibly been, it's strange that pretty much the whole movie is shot in a bunch of claustrophobic hotel rooms. &nbsp;It's kinda cool to see Leaud in his mid-40's, a bit paunchy and slower, but the actual detective story was so irrelevant and non-engaging (and hard to unravel anyway) that by the end, when he puts forth his theory of the murder, it's even more tossed-off and stupid. &nbsp;Bonus points, though, for making a film about boxing that doesn't have a single scene of boxing in it, as far as I can remember. &nbsp;Because, believe me, my mind wandered during this. &nbsp;I may sound disappointed because I am; after a relatively strong string of films I was about to go to bat for the 80s being Godard's best period!</p><br /><br /><br /><br />23 October 2010<br />Louis C.K.: Hilarious<br />, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>it's awesome that Louis CK made a feature-length standup movie, cause no one really does that anymore. &nbsp;So this reminded me of watching Eddie Murphy 'Raw' on HBO at my cousin's house when I was a kid. &nbsp;Except that Louie's humour makes sense only when you're an adult, and one who is particularly pessimistic and dark. &nbsp;Some of the material he did on Conan was repeated here but I didn't mind cause that whole routine (about how spoiled people are with technology today) is among my favourite of his stuff. &nbsp;The part about his daughter shitting and falling in it right in front of him while he was shitting was pretty amazing too. &nbsp;There is nobody better, nobody funnier, and I probably should have waited to watch this because it's going to be a long lull before the next season of 'Louie'.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />29 October 2010<br />Scott Pilgrim vs. the World<br />Edgar Wright, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>I spent 2/3 of this movie not really enjoying it, but by the end I thought it was fun and cute and all of those things. &nbsp;I'm a bit too old to really connect with this stuff, even though the aesthetic was totally stuck in late 90s alterna-rock. &nbsp;Almost to the point of being a period piece, except they mention blogs. &nbsp;So it ends up being a weird cultural take, probably I'm guessing because the comic this is based on was set in that time. &nbsp;I'm not one for hyperstylised quirky stuff but it's hard to pick too much fault in this, which exists purely as entertainment and I guess it does that well. &nbsp;Once Jason Schwartzmann entered the picture I enjoyed things much more - particularly when him and Cera are arguing about who is the hip flavour of the month. &nbsp;I enjoyed the cover version of Sade too.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />30 October 2010<br />The Other Guys<br />Adam McKay, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>Will Ferrell movies with Adam McKay are supposed to be a cut above the average ones, and I guess this was. &nbsp;I'd put it about on par with <em>Step Brothers</em>&nbsp;- which is to say, I laughed a good bit -- though it's ultimately disappointing. &nbsp;Sticking to the cop film genre is probably what hurt this film though at least the plot was slightly more complicated than it had to be. &nbsp;Michael Keaton was excellent and I think this is probably the funniest Ferrell character because it's a bit different from his usual over-the-top aloofness. &nbsp;I wonder why these American comedies keep underwriting for Steve Coogan. &nbsp;He's capable of so much more but it never happens. &nbsp;I got bored a bit but the action scenes weren't too long and there were enough inane jokes sprinkled in (the running TLC gag was probably the best) to keep my interest. &nbsp;I don't know what the deal was with the closing credit infographics - am I supposed to believe that this film was a serious commentary on TARP and the wallstreet bailout? &nbsp;Leave your social commentary at home, McKay, and just stick to the nonsense. &nbsp;I have a bad feeling about <em>Anchorman 2</em>&nbsp;but of course I'll go to see it anyway.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 November 2010<br />King Lear<br />Jean-Luc Godard, USA, 1987<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>Godard's fucked-up, tongue-in-cheek disassemblage of <em>King Lear</em>&nbsp;is pretty riveting stuff if you like inconclusive riffs on art and language, and I do! &nbsp;This follows along the same themes that I'm used to be this point - mostly, the relationship between text + sound + image, made explicit by William Shaksper Jr the Fifth wandering around trying to reconstruct his ancestor's text. &nbsp;This doesn't have much to do with the original <em>Lear</em>&nbsp;(which is fine by me); we get Norman Mailer at the beginning, Burgess Meredith's Lear as a Jewish gangster (clutching <em>The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Gangster in America</em>, a book I'd like to read) and Molly Ringwald playing a surprisingly bright, versatile Cordelia. &nbsp;Peter Sellars as Shaksper is the coherent centre to the film, and Godard himself as Proessor Pluggy is totally ridiculous and hilarious when he's understandable. &nbsp;It's a shame I was watching such a bad VHS rip because I'd really like to see a better presentation of this; there were lots of lights and shadows no doubt to illustrate Shaksper's discovery the image. &nbsp;Like <em>Passion</em>, this shows a J-LG looking to confront the classics and figure out how to use and re-use themes. &nbsp;It's totally messy (and I don't think Godard took this project very serioulsy) but it manages to be great anyway. &nbsp;Woody Allen could have been used more but it was great to see him make a fairly meaningless appearance. &nbsp;Like <em>Alphaville</em>, this is a post-apocaloyptic Dystopian film that uses no special imagery or visual effects -- actually, most of this film appears to be shot in a hotel. &nbsp;Which, come to think of it, most if not all of Godard's 80s films are done that way and a good deal of his earlier work. &nbsp;I guess the man loves hotels.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />4 November 2010<br />Micmacs<br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet, France, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>I had a smile on my face from start to finish, which isn't a shock given that I enjoy Jeunet's work. &nbsp;This is maybe the best one since <em>Delicatessen</em>&nbsp;(though I realise I've missed a few); actually it's an updating of that Robin Williams movie <em>Toys</em>&nbsp;filtered through a super French consciousness with some great Rube Goldberg stuff. &nbsp;Perfectly styled cute humour, absurd sillyness all around - the macabre elements of <em>Delicatessen</em>&nbsp;are completely gone for this more family-friendly fare (perhaps that was Marc Caro's influence?), but I can live with that. &nbsp;Please keep 'em coming.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />5 November 2010<br />Mr. Brooks<br />Bruce A. Evans, USA, 2007<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I admit, it's an intriguing premise. &nbsp;And a friend said he was a big fan of this film, which I know has some minor cult following. &nbsp;But, my god, this was awful. On the ol' absolute value scale of entertainment I'd have to rank it pretty high, only because of the ridiculous plot twists and overall concept. &nbsp;William Hurt coulda been a lot creepier, and I don't think I'll ever understand why Demi Moore became a movie star. &nbsp;Costner is pretty enjoyable though, and I've been feeling an urge to watch <em>Waterworld</em>&nbsp;and <em>the Postman</em>&nbsp;and all the suposedly terrible films he did. &nbsp;Dane Cook is supremely unlikeable but that's probaby my existing bias. &nbsp; I guess by 2007 Costner wasn't exactly the force he once was. &nbsp;I did like the washed out look of things, and I laughed out loud so many times that I lost count. &nbsp;"Implausible" and "preposterous" would be good words for this, but that's better than "boring" which is more than I can say about a lot of films. &nbsp;It's a shame they ruined what would have otherwise been an amazing ending. &nbsp;"It's so easy to break into the police department's computer!"</p><br /><br /><br /><br />6 November 2010<br />Keep Your Right Up<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 1987<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>This was an uncompromising film, perhaps the most experimental of anything I've seen by Godard so far (and that's saying something), yet I didn't find it tough-going. &nbsp;Instead it was quite invigorating, with a real momentum through three three intangible narratives as they intertwined. &nbsp;This film seemed to be concerned with people in physical space, as there was a lot of focus on landscapes/outdoors scenes and then cramped interiors such as trains and planes. &nbsp;Transportation is also a key theme, now that I think about it. &nbsp;I don't know that I can make any more clear of an assessment because this was pretty disassociative. &nbsp;If I'm going by Wikipedia's grouping of Godard's work,this is the end of his 80's period, though maybe that's just a temporal distinction - this certainly resembled <span style="font-style: italic;">Numero Deux</span>&nbsp;more than anything else he did in the 80s except for possibly <em>Lear</em>&nbsp;(though this was far more serious). But it certainly feels like some kind of turning point, so I guess it's time to dive into the 90s.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />10 November 2010<br />Hausu<br />Nobuhiko Obayashi, Japan, 1977<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>It's hard to separate the sheer entertainment/messed-up factor of <em>Hausu</em>&nbsp;from any sort of potentially intelligent criticism. &nbsp;It's all rolled into an overpowering sensory experience that feels almost beyond criticism. &nbsp;This is a film that speaks in an incredibly unique language, one of pure delirium. &nbsp;Though I've seen my fair share of fucked up, surreal, experimental and transgressive cinema, this feels like a sideways path to any precedents. &nbsp;That it's wrapped up in Japanese sexual fetishes makes it actually somewhat more approachable, though a bit disappointing in some sense. &nbsp;It's actually fairly impossible for me to critique this because it's not fair to hold it to the same standards as other films (both technically and artistically) -- this uniqueness doesn't make it meritous alone, but the amount of enjoyment I got from it was quite high. &nbsp;Whether that enjoyment was solely due to my flabbergasted mentality while watching, or because the film truly spoke to me, I can't say. &nbsp;Perhaps future viewings will make things more clear.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />13 November 2010<br />The Illusionist<br />Neil Burger, Czech Republic / USA, 2006<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I wonder why 2006 produced two big-budget films about fin-de-siecle conjurers. &nbsp;This was really a film about facial hair, which was magnificent in every frame. &nbsp;It was based on a Steven Millhauser story that I probably read a long time ago, and managed to convey his sense of period-heavy personality studies, except without being engaging as a film. Norton and Giamatti were funny to watch with their British accents (even though this is a film set in Vienna, so why?) but the actual machinations of story, plot etc were completely boring. &nbsp;While sepia-drenched moustaches are always good, they don't sustain a 2 hour film. &nbsp;Who are these films made for? &nbsp;I can't imagine anyone getting excited about this film; it wasn't just boring, it was boring and beautiful, which actually made it more boring.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />18 November 2010<br />I'm Still Here<br />Casey Affleck, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>Wow. &nbsp;What an amazingly great trip. &nbsp;I didn't love this because it was a put-on ; like this year's other hoax documentary (<em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>), it's only exploiting an already-corrupt, vacuous system. &nbsp;I think great hoaxers, like Alan Abel or Joey Skaggs, provoke intense and intelligent thoughts, which this didn't really do. &nbsp;But also, it doesn't matter - since I've never seen a Joaquin Phoenix film before, I knew nothing about him and this could have been a blatantly fictional character without it really affecting my enjoyment. &nbsp;This was hilarious from start to finish; I can't even single out a&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;part. Sean Combs was far more enjoyable here than in <em>Get Him to the Greek</em>&nbsp;and the his facial expressions when listening to Phoenix's demo are the kind of thing I would want to watch over and over. &nbsp;Compli-fucking-cations! &nbsp;Thanks for the recommendation, Doug.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />20 November 2010<br />Runaway Train<br />Andrei Konchalovsky, USA / Israel, 1985<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>This film is totally 'trending' on PBT right now. &nbsp;What an insane work -- insane in the directing/acting department, with bizarre and poorly dubbed sound and a compelling, Kurosawa-penned screenplay. &nbsp;This is the kind of film that transcends genres. &nbsp;Definitely Jon Voight's most memorable performance ever, and Eric Roberts is completely hard to stomach in the best possible way. &nbsp;Rebecca DeMornay = 80s Sissy Spacek, and I really dug the use of a Shakespeare quote instead of spending money on FX for the crash. &nbsp;The prison stuff at the beginning was great too and the cinematography, even in my pixelated DivX rip, was hazy to the point of being scary. &nbsp;Redubbing this with Soul Asylum over the closing scene, and then re-titling 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' would be a nice idea.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />21 November 2010<br />Nouvelle vague<br />, SwitzerlandFrance, 1990<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><p>Godard's 90's period begins with this cleverly-titled film, which felt like a cross between <em>Sauve qui peut (la vie)</em>&nbsp;and <em>Soigne ta droite</em>. &nbsp;From a technical and stylistic point of view, this film is bathed in the language of European cinema. &nbsp;For someone who fought against the idea of the high-quality French art film for so many years, this is like a total acceptance of it (or maybe an attempt to reinvent the idea which I didnt understand). &nbsp;Anne-Marie Mi&eacute;ville handled the art direction here, and it's stunning, though a bit conventional. &nbsp;The outdoor scenes radiate with lush greens and reds, and there are some impressive tracking shots (both outdoors and in the factory). &nbsp;The soundtrack is romantic, neo-traditional folk, with reverb-laden violins that make me think of Nils &Oslash;kland's music. &nbsp;Thumbs up to Mi&eacute;ville, whose steering of this ship was probably my favourite aspect of the film. &nbsp;But the narrative, dialogue and acting? I can't say that I connected with this at all. &nbsp;Clearly, it's about a man re-assessing his life from middle age, so maybe I'll see this again in 15 years and feel differently. &nbsp;But the loose, experimental feeling was absent of any truly thought-provoking ideas (for me), even though every line of dialogue was allegedly a quotation. &nbsp;Where <em>Soigne ta droite</em>&nbsp;had a sense of absurdity and anarchy, that was absent here, and maybe I'm just not mature enough to appreciate a film like this without those sparks.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br /><br />22 November 2010<br />Allemagne 90 neuf z&#xE9;ro<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1991<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><p>I had absolutely no idea this film existed - a 'sequel' to <em>Alphaville</em>&nbsp;made 25 years later, sort of. &nbsp;A sequel in the sense that it's Eddy Constatine playing Lemmy Caution under Godard's direction again, though there were actually many Lemmy Caution films. &nbsp;But even <em>Alphaville</em>&nbsp;is like a more traditional spy/sci-fi film compared to this, which is an exploration of Berlin just after the fall of the wall. &nbsp;For the duration of this, Lemmy Caution wanders around Germany, looking at the various creations and aberrations found there. &nbsp;It's funny how much more dystopian and sci-fi this looks than <em>Alphaville</em>, even though it's set in the 'real' world and uses no doctored setups. &nbsp;The narration and dialogue is often rambling and hard to concentrate on, but I've gotten used to that by now. &nbsp;I liked how stark and weird this felt despite it's relative accessibility. &nbsp;There are a few really corny shots, like the car that has run over the Karl-Marx-Stra&szlig;e street sign. &nbsp;Godard has curated scenes of Germany in 1990 that make it feel like civilisation has truly reached an end - there are very few signs of normal life here, as the scenes are sparsely populated and Caution is this weird Jesus figure trying to tie it all together.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />1 December 2010<br />Les enfants jouent &#xE0; la Russie<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1993<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This video essay looked at the art and literature of Russia, of course from a cinematic perspective.  Throughout it's short running time, Godard employed a ton of editing tricks to create a barrage of images that were occasionally very irritating, almost like a strobe effect.  The initial shots I thought were going to set the tone for a film about Eisenstein, but instead Dostoevsky was a more central character.  The narration, in a calm American voice, made this feel somewhat more focused that his usual rambling essay style.  The images were sometimes very discordant, though they seemed to be primarily lifted from classic Soviet cinema.  Over this, Godard filmed a loose narrative about a film director, with some various other actors repeating actions (on the phone, or standing in a doorway).  This wasn't the most thought-provoking Godard film, if only because it was somewhat mature and less fiery than I like it to be.  I like the way it looks to the Russian Other particularly given the recent fall of the Soviet Union, but it seems to sidestep Godard's own engagement with Marxist/socialist politics.  The bizarre video effects, at times almost like crude animations with the overlaid titles changing font sizes on the fly, etc., were mostly just irritating and made this feel schizophrenic.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 December 2010<br />H&#xE9;las pour moi<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 1993<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: NONE<br />Gerard Depardieu was the biggest French actor of this era and it's easy to see why.  In <i>Helas pour moi</i>, even though he sorta stumbles through it, gruffly barks his lines and reportedly clashed with Godard on everything -- he does more with his eyes than many actors can do in a career.  I think I really enjoyed this.  Again, following from <i>Nouvelle Vague</i>, it's cinematographically as crisp as can be, with a blue/green filter over many of the outdoor scenes which cast the whole film under a pleasantly Utopian shadow.  This is the most explicit work of surrealism in Godard's catalog since <i>Week End</i>, though apart from a few comic outbursts it stays somber and haunting.  The languid unfolding of this film reminds me of what I've seen of Ruiz, and Depardieu's presence recalls those Blier films, particularly <i>Buffet Froid</i>.  The narrative is about a woman who has an affair on her husband, with her husband, and the centre of this story is an impossible situation that's impossible to unravel or make any sense of.  Despite this bizarre and absurd premise, the acting and direction is strong enough to establish a weighty emotional stasis that's strangely affecting, even if there's little actual sense to be made.  The dialogue, like <i>Nouvelle Vague</i>, just bounced right off me; at this point Godard is making explicitly "arthouse" films that are slightly disappointing only because his iconoclasms appears to have dried up.  But it's still stylistically bold, and has the usual motifs (lots of intercut titles, for example) that I still appreciate even after seeing, what,  36 other films by him?<br /><br /><br /><br />3 December 2010<br />Kimjongilia<br />N.C. Heikin, USA / France / South Korea, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This documentary interviewed a number of North Korean refugees to tell their stories of suffering and escape.  It's heavy, moving stuff, but the overall film had a very bland, schoolhouse quality to it.  I didn't learn anything from this, which isn't that important, but I also wasn't even that interested, which is terrible considering how traumatic these stories were.  The one positive thing I will say is that it challenges the tendency to laugh at the absurdity of North Korea, something I've done many times and also perpetuated by things like <i>The Daily Show</i>, and <i>The Red Chapel</i>.  While the situation is insane and absurd, it is also a massive human rights issue that really is no laughing matter.  <br /><br /><br /><br />12 December 2010<br />The Silencers<br />Phil Karlson, USA, 1966<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This is the first in a series of four "Matt Helm" films starring Dean Martin as an American James Bond takeoff.  There's a lighthearted feel as well as ludicrous plot elements (the Chinese bad guy with obviously painted-on Oriental eyes and an accent that is more homosexual than ethnic) but without the glamourous locations of British classiness, the resulting film is an awkward, crude mess.  But there's plenty of Dean Martin-sung songs as background music to carry things through.  The quips and one-liners aren't even very good, though I guess the femme fatales were attractive (except the clumsy one was just such a ridiculous character it was hard to take seriously).  'Lovey Cravesit' is even a weak Bond girl name.  Maybe it's just me, but I can't see Dean Martin as anything except a dago from Steubenville.  I'll probably watch the rest of these on several rainy days but maybe cut with some more meaty spy fare in between.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 December 2010<br />Cronos<br />Guillermo del Toro, Mexico, 1993<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />I've never seen anything by del Toro before so I thought I'd start with this early feature.  I was hoping <i>Cronos</i> would be a time-travel film, cause I love time-travel films.  Instead I got an interesting, original vampire film.   Ron Perlman was really enjoyable as the over-masculine baddy, and the lead actor guy was fantastic.  I admit this pulled me in much more than I expected and I liked del Toro's style, which was appealing without being overly flashy.  I genuinely didn't know where this would end up going.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 December 2010<br />JLG/JLG - autoportrait de d&#xE9;cembre<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1994<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><i>JLG</i> begins as a somber affair, another meditative self-portrait, the only difference from all of the others is that this one is explicitly about Godard (and stars him) instead of supposing to be about King Lear or something else.  This is a rather gentle film that seems content to balance Godard's thoughts and reflections against the natural surroundings of his home (Switzerland, I think?).  As it moves along we start to meet more characters - editors, reviewers, etc - all involved in analysing the work of a filmmaker.  The comments about marketing and films as commercial products don't show a resolutely anti-capitalist JLG, but rather someone who is comfortable with this relationship.  The music and scenery keeps the film from being a jumble of quotations and confusing monologues; Godard is usually off camera, or shot from the side or behind, in shadows.  I question if "JLG" is supposed to be some sort of character, but there's no attempt to fictionalise his history, as we see many posters and artefacts from his previous work.  By this point, most of his films for the past decade were made up of these vaguely philosophical quotes, rarely converging into anything concrete.  Here, it's slightly more lucid, as if making sense is a key goal of the older, reflective filmmaker.  There are lots of scenes of the filmmaker at work - editing equipment, viewfinders, small video monitors -though they seem to be props, or reminders of a career rather than being practically employed.  This has the vibe of someone's last film, though really it was just an interlude while making the <i>Histoires du cinema</i>.  My favourite part was watching the man play tennis in sweatpants, a porkpie hat and a white jumper.  <br /><br /><br /><br />15 December 2010<br />The Expendables<br />Sylvester Stallone, USA, 2010<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />I was pretty surprised by <i>The Expendables</i>, mostly because I didn't think they let fourth-graders write big-budget action movies.  This was so terrible that I actually had a hard time getting my head around it -- I thought that Hollywood films had to be slightly more intelligent in the age of Christopher Nolan, etc.  Every element of this seemed to be sketched out by an 11 year old on a napkin, without any concern for how all these scenes could be put together coherently.  "Let's have them fly a biplane with guns in the front!"  "How about a bulletproof truck?" "One guy will be all about knives and the other all about guns!"   Because of this, the film had a very weird pacing and structure - it was the most formulaic plot, dialogue, characters, etc imaginable -- but then, I couldn't feel the film fall into predictable arcs.  When they went to the island the first time it felt like the end of the film; Dolph Lundgren's battle with Jet Li also felt misplaced, and I never got much of a sense of where things were going.  This didn't really disorientate me as much as it bored me; I wish I could say this was innovatively structured.  But, no, just dumb.  Of course, the heroes were heroic because there were cold-blooded mass-murderers, and also the military dictatorship of a fictional island.  There were some real moments of pleasure for me, though: Eric Roberts, who played the kid in <i>Runaway Train</i>, cast as a wonderfully tanned baddie; any scene where Jason Statham tried to express his romantic frustration; the Dolph Lundgren character, whose function in the film served little purpose except to reassemble the stars of Rocky IV; pretty much all of the dialogue.  I thought this was going to be an homage to the homoerotic 80s action film, but I must have gotten it mixed up with <i>MacGruber</i>.   There's no trace of irony, and the quips weren't very good.  Even the waterboarding scene failed to be a comment on, well, anything.  <br /><br /><br /><br />18 December 2010<br />Cold Souls<br />Sophie Barthes, USAFrance, 2009<br />Location: TV area<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Not great, but not terrible.  Paul Giamatti playing a caricature of himself isn't much of a novelty, though ten years ago I probably would have found such a device more interesting.  (Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon do it so well on 'The Trip', anyway).  This wasn't really a comedy, but it wasn't that serious either.  By failing to commit in a certain direction, the whole film ended up feeling a bit lightweight.  The scenes with David Straithairn were the best, and I do like Giamatti - his intentional bad acting when soulless was probably the funniest bit. <br /><br /><br /><br />19 December 2010<br />The Town<br />Ben Affleck, USA, 2010<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Don Draper, crimestopper!  This smash hit film wasn't anything special, though I stayed entertained throughout.  The moral seems to be that people from Charlestown are fucking assholes, or maybe that's just what I read into it.  Two hours of non-stop Boston accents was intense.  None of the subsequent heists matched up to the first one, before the credits even started.  Jon Hamm is such a pleasure to watch, I'd probably watch anything with him.  I'm no Affleck fan, but Jeremy Renner is so, so great -- how big can his star get?  <br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2010<br />For Ever Mozart<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 1996<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br /><i>For Ever Mozart</i> is an interesting film, and I guess I ultimately enjoyed it.  The attempts at humour mostly fell flat, and it had a weird sense of being part comedy, part art film, and also a commentary on the crisis in Bosnia.  The section of the film set in Sarajevo recalls <i>Les Carabiniers</i> for being a portrait of war that is not even slightly glamorous, but instead a mess of muddy fields.  The explosions actually add a sense of danger to the proceedings, which is not something I'm used to when watching a "film about film" film.  There seemed to be just enough plot to drive this along and distinguish it from being another aloof collection of profound quotes and absurd scenarios.  I can't say that I found it particularly engaging, but I recognize the ambition of certain segments, and there were a few parts that were memorable.  The pentultimate sequence of filmgoers attending <i>For Ever Mozart</i> was entertainingly metafictional, and the final segment (which actually featured Mozart) seemed like nothing but a non-sequitur.  The first part of the film, with the actors reading their lines, recalled Rivette's experimental with illustrating the dramatic process, at least what I've seen in <i>Out One</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2010<br />The Kids Are All Right<br />Lisa Cholodenko, USA, 2010<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />Actually I have to say <i>The Kids Are All Right</I> was an excellent bit of filmmaking.  What made it solid was the acting; the leads were all great, but the teenage actors were particularly good, which is sometimes difficult with teenagers in movies.  This is the type of film to watch if you want to learn about acting, for traditional dramatic elements and many subtleties as well.  I felt a slight critique of middle-class American life underneath; the way the moms tried to deal with the family problems felt futile and formulaic, like they were following a manual.  Ruffalo is a far better actor than I ever realised, and he brings a lot of empathy to his character, becoming more than the adult Joey Lawrence that he seemed in the first few scenes.  I like how conventional this is despite the seeming unconventional nature of the family; I'm not sure if it resolves to reinforce stereotypes about fulfillmant and sexuality, or if it challenges them - but it doesn't matter.  It's a film about people, and it breathes nicely throughout.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2010<br />13<br />G&#xE9;la Babluani, USA, 2010<br />Location: bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />An absolutely RIDICULOUSly bad film.  However, the first part and last part were great.  The opening act was amazingly surreal and mysterious; it drew me in and was shot in a strange David Lynch style (it helps that the lead actor is the spitting image of a young Kyle McLaughlan, except crossed slightly with the kid from <i>Lost Highway</i>.  The middle third of the film, in which the main plot unfolds, is like a bad B-movie/Kilgore Trout concept.  It's entertaining through it's meaningless name actors (Ben Gazzarra, OMG; Mickey Rourke and 50 Cent for no real reason) and Michael Shannon's cartoonish screaming over everything.  But the super secret society of bigwigs portrayed in this film has a real-life analogue - the group of Hollywood producers who conspired to create crap films like this.  I suspect this has high Ned and Daron potential.  And then, the ending, which works quite well in a thriller/suspense way, and genuinely surprised me.  It makes me think that Géla Babluani might be a good filmmaker if given a decent script.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 January 2011<br />The Social Network<br />David Fincher, USA, 2010<br />Location: TV area / bedroom<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer / DivX on TV via Xbox<br />Company: none<br />This was a bit of an odd choice for 'first film of the year' but it was easy.  I wonder if this is the first Fincher film I have seen since <i>Fight Club</i>?  I understand this film's popularity as it's well-written and paced in a way that kept my interest.  Jesse Eisenberg nails the asshole/fucked up geek thing, and I do like Justin Timberlake as an actor.  Overall I wasn't that sucked in because I ultimately couldn't empathise with any of the characters - this was a film with no heroes or villains, just a portrayal of a group of people who I'm not particularly interested in  -- but because of the film being well-made I stayed with it, despite wanting to nod off in the middle.<br /><br /><br /><br />15 January 2011<br />True Grit<br />Ethan Coen, Joel Coen, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />Company: none<br />I love Charles Portis, though <i>True Grit</i> is my least favourite of his books.  I never saw the first film, and when I heard the Coens were remaking it I was actually disappointed that they weren't adapting <i>The Dog of the South</i> or <i>Gringos </i>instead. (<i>Norwood</i> allegedly was adapted into a film which is really obscure). But anyway, I went into this with no expectations and was a bit surprised at how the comedy was downplayed.  I remember the book being hilarious, like all Portis books, whereas this seemed to concentrate more on the Western aesthetic and being gritty.  Bridges was pretty fun, I guess, though this feels like their most conventional film, maybe even moreso than <i>Ladykillers</i>.  I have little desire to rewatch this ever, while I've been thinking about watching <i>A Serious Man </i>again -- actually, I think about that film all the time.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2011<br />The Fighter<br />David O. Russell, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I'm a mild David O. Russell fan and it's kinda crazy that he hasn't put out a film since <i>Huckabees</i>.  This I think has been praised for Melissa Leo's performance, and rightly so, though I found myself troubled by the stereotypical Hollywood underdog scenes.  A few shots were framed in such a lame manner that I almost thought Russell was being ironic, because he's smart (such as when the big-time manager approaches Mark Wahlberg and he's standing between his family and the manager, with appropriate focusing; also the sudden slow-mo jerks when the fight momentum changes at the end.  I could have done with the last climactic fight being shot in a more straight way, because I wasn't so into the editing but I did want to see a good boxing movie. And also, less scenes of Christian Bale's scumbag crack-smoking friends.  It was nice to see a film where Bale was unlikeable; I prefer him in villainous roles since I find him, well, unlikeable.  RRR Ron is the real pride of Lowell anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 January 2011<br />S&#xFC;gisball<br />Veiko &#xD5;unpuu, Estonia, 2007<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DVD on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Ville Hyvönen loaned me this, once of the more acclaimed recent Estonian films and also one that many of his friends were in.  I enjoyed <i>Sügisball</i> quite a lot, as it was beautiful photographed with many lyrical, wordless passages.  The bleakness felt a bit exaggerated and at times melodramatic, but I think that's what Õunpuu was going for.  Lasnamäe never looked so majestic - and this was really a film about periphery.  The weak points, for me, were the few occasional attempts at humour, such as when one character was purchasing a porn mag and the cashier was loudly asking everyone how much it cost.  The film was also scored quite dramatically - GYBE! was present as well as various other thick strings and cellos, adding extra gravitas to some of the scenes, no doubt meant to be ironic.  The theme of desperation and perversion that ran underneath everything was particularly fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2011<br />48 Hrs.<br />Walter Hill, USA, 1982<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Despite Nick Nolte being almost intolerable, there was still a lot of residue of gritty 70s cop films here.  This is far less a comedy than I expected, though Eddie Murphy is just so fucking magical that it's hard not to laugh throughout, even with less 'jokes' than other films.  I don't know how I never saw this before, though I have seen the sequel at least twice.  Nolte's casual racism was the best thing about his character, which was otherwise clichéd to the point of ridiculousness.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2011<br />Swingers<br />Doug Liman, USA, 1996<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I saw this on New Years Eve 1997 and didn't watch it all that closely, and remembered it as a fairly misogynistic film that was responsible for launching the career of Vince Vaughn.  In Patton Oswalt's recent (awesome) BS report podcast, he mentioned how most people missed the whole point of <meta charset="utf-8"/>Vaughn's character, which was not that he was a cool guy but that he was a fucking piece of shit, but most shitheads watching it tried to emulate him.  So, I rewatched this and started to see it as a critique of masculinity, something I'm always into in cinema (see: Cassavetes).  The relationship between Favreau and <meta charset="utf-8"/>Vaughn is complex, because there's a lot of love and caring from <meta charset="utf-8"/>Vaughn even if his treatment of women is horrible and barbaric.  This film is probably responsible for codifying a lot of ideas about single life, some of which I think indirectly influenced me -- all the stupid rules, like wait two days before calling her, or the way they go to a party that starts at 8, by first hitting a bar at 10, and then a bite to eat at 11 before arriving at the party at 12.  Favreau's character is clearly the moral voice as well as the heart and soul of the film, but it's also interesting to see how he is sucked into the whirlwind of masculine identity construction.  The aesthetics of the film, which seemed much more contemporary 13 years ago, seem to emphasise this - the neo-swing music, slight rockabilly fashion style and overall reminiscing for times past just feels like a weird subcultural blip of the 90s, preserved forever in this film.   I'm not sure if this was actually their intent, but it has that effect in hindsight.  Yeah, I have to say I liked <i>Swingers</i> quite a lot on viewing #2, as I realise how influenced it is by Woody Allen (especially in the opening titles).  There aren't any actual female characters in the film, but the ones that are there, thankfully, are not just objects -- they are just unwritten.    And by the end, <meta charset="utf-8"/>Vaughn has learned nothing, and is not likely to change at all.  <i>Made</i> is next, I guess.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 January 2011<br />Dinner for Schmucks<br />Jay Roach, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I went into this with super low expectations, but I was shocked at how much I laughed.  I didn't expect this to be terrible, but I'd actually say it was above average.  Carrell is such a talent, doing that thing where he brings empathy to an idiot, and any time Zach Galifianakis was on-screen I could barely contain my laughter.  His first scene I will probably even re-watch.  Jemaine from Conchords is also pretty incredible, and since the plot was slightly more interesting than the typical film like this, it managed to sustain itself throughout.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2011<br />Please Give<br />Nicole Holofcener, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Another sad yet comic film about middle class Americans and their struggles.  I'm afraid that I secretly like films like this, or at least when they are extremely well done like this one.  Nothing too dramatic happens and even the affair plot, which some stories would based entirely around, was given no more attention that the teenage-girl-can't-find-a-pair-of-jeans plot.  Keener is a great actress who seems to mostly make movies like this, which lets her stretch her chops in an environment that isn't too demanding.  Her character, struggling to stay alive under the weight of her own guilt and sympathy, is no more mature than any other character.  In fact, in four generations of characters, none are any more wise or mature than any of the others.  I practically fell in love with Rebecca Hall here (though I didn't like her much in <i>The Town</i>, oddly) but this avoided the shitty romantic indie-film cutesyness that I so despise.  So actually, I'd say this was a pretty great film, and easy to watch.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 January 2011<br />Histoire(s) du cinéma<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1998<br />Location: Ptarmigan Helsinki, Köie flat, a ferry, etc.<br />Format: DivX on TV and laptop, various methods of watching<br />Company: none<br /><font size="2">Godard's <i>Histoire(s) du cinéma </i>project is such an immense construction of video art that it's really hard to write about here.  It's easy to say this is Godard's masterpiece, and one of the high water marks of all video art I've ever seen, but that's almost a copout.  But after one viewing, it's not really fair for me to say anything deeper.  The only thing I've ever experienced on the same scale was <i>Star-Spangled to Death</i>, though the two projects do very different things with the same language (long duration, text on screen, use of other footage though Jacobs was much more influenced by randomness while J-LG is crazy particular).  <i>Histoire(s) du cinéma </i>is also that perfect level of difficult for me - it's not completely impenetrable, but damn close, and really seems like a labyrinths of ideas of inspiration and exploration.  I took notes throughout the viewing of this, corresponding to each of the 8 parts (which are listed on IMDB separately, so I cheated and created this aggregate entry for PBT, which is linked only to the first episode).  So my rough notes follow, which are pretty messy and don't really do justice to the experience.  I started watching this in Helsinki and finished it about a month later in Tallinn, so I took my time.  The whole work is so demanding and erudite that it's ridiculous to try to summarise it or even form an opinion -- what I will have to do is go back and use this like a cookbook, looking for ideas and diversions when I'm writing about film or looking for a unique way to think about something.</font><p></p><p class="p1"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2"><i>Tout les cinemas</i>.  A pretty full-on introduction, giving me some sense of what the overall impact of this film will be.  The subtitles are partial, but I'm fine with that; most of the text on-screen I can understand, probably 80% of it, and maybe I'll sit with a dictionary for the rest of it. Although, looking down for a few seconds means I will miss a lot, cause this is as dense as experimental documentary gets.  The constant montages and video effects, though they date this part of the film to 1988, don't really bother me - the rapid fire strobe-effects, when conjoined with the typewriter sound, actually works to illustrate something very basic about cinema - that it is light projected into a dark room.  This has a real Bruce Conner aesthetic, which is certainly cool, and it's even more aggressively "video" than the 70's SonImage stuff.  The thread is loose and it's a film to suggest and inspire rather than stake out a clear, precise academic argument, but that's fine with me.  Fascism and war seemed to be central to this.  Part 2/1b, <i>A Single Cinema</i>, is maybe meant to be a joke title because this is when the complexity and plurality of the project really hit me.  At any point, there are a several overlaid images and sounds, making what feels like a true garden of forking paths.  This is also where I most realised the futility of trying to watch this without being a fluent French speaker, because most of the film clips in the audio portion were spoken French, and I was having enough trouble following all of the text and listening to Godard's own narration, which was even less partially translated than in the first part.  But I maybe enjoyed this even more, if that makes any sense.  Here, Godard declares that the cinema is about sex and death (right there presenting two stories of "a single cinema") and riffs around these themes for 40 minutes.  There are some fantastic moments of carefully selected synchronicity between the overlapping images, and a lot of coloured film stills are there which remind me of some of Greenaway's imagery from stuff like Vertical Features Remake.  The music was full-on as well, often with string quartets and the occasional Leonard Cohen interlude, which cut through the madness like only he can.  The ending section was formally beautiful - some churchy organ music, a monotone scratch French male voice from an old film (I assume), and various images but dominated by colorful, primitif/impressionist paintings (probably Gaugin but I'm not sure).  </font></p><br /><p class="p1"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2">Episode 3, <i>Seul le cinema</i> or 'only cinema' takes on a more restrained approach.  It was finished more than a few years after the first two parts, and the style shows slight advances in technology and design, or maybe I just thought the fonts looked different.  The first ten minutes was dominated by a conversation between Godard (mostly off-screen) and someone else, but this is a point where my partial subtitles failed -- most of it was incomprehensible to me.  The remaining bit of this piece (which was shorter than the first two - about a half-hour total) was dominated by female narration, occasionally cutting to actual shots of the woman speaking.  This essay touched on the earliest creation of projected light, and a lot of other things that I found difficult to follow.  The language was significantly more flowery, almost like a distinctly feminine voice.  Part four, <i>Fatal beauty</i>, perhaps more directly conflates sex and death, though actually it's a more calm, minimal episode, largely using black and white footage and with several very placid meditations.  A long portion is a woman talking as if being interviewed, and this is totally untranslated in my copy.</font></p><br /><p class="p1"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2">Part five, <i>Une vague nouvelle</i>,  looks (I think) at change in cinema, using a lot of footage of Godard's own <i>Alphaville</i>.  There's a few passages with strobing lights, operatic overlays, and a gorgeous washed out black and white video transfer that take it into a very hypnotic moment.  That he's sticking blips of Holocaust footage in there, while having narration about the idea of perspective in Western painting, almost makes something overwhelming.  There's a use of shocking imagery throughout - the withered Minimata disease-affected hand from the cover of <i>Plastic Surgery Disasters</i>, dead bodies here and there - perhaps demanding the history of cinema be addressed from an activist perspective.  Beyond the use of <i>Alphaville</i>, though, there's not much addresing the history of the French new wave.  </font></p><br /><p class="p1"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2">Part 6, <i>La Monnaie de L'Absolu</i>,  begins with the most lucid and didactic moment of the whole project - continuing from the images of atrocity glimpsed in <i>Une vague nouvelle</i>, Godard lays out the opening section of the video with non-stop horrors and tragedies, while intoning about the role of government in crimes.  It's explicit and speaks from a place of pure outrage that is rarely seen in his work with some blatant obviousness.  About halfway through the film devolves into a more personal tract, with Godard asking questions about thought, and then resumes to discuss the idea of occuptation.  He asks, in one of the most memorable segments so far, why no one was making resistance cinema between 1940 and 1945?  He then twists this to ask why no one was fighting the American occupation, and cites only <i>Rome, Open City</i>  as the one exception.  Then, talking about the golden age of Italian cinema, he claims the predecessors of great Italian Rennaissance art are responsible for infusing the images of great Italian cinema with such majesty, despite not being shot with sync sound.  The episode ends with a long montage of scenes from Italian films set to a cheesy Italian pop ballad.</font></p><br /><p class="p1"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2">Part 7, which is actually Part 4 A, is really half-and-half for me.  The first half is quite lucid, with a long section about Hitchcock and the way his films use objects and strange narratives to "be in control of the universe".  But then the second half is almost completely inpenetrable, taken over by an unnamed non-Godard narrator (showing reading, but face obscured by shadows) intoning long passages that sounded beautiful, yet added up to nothing for me.  </font></p><p class="p2"><font size="2"><br/></font></p><br /><p class="p2"><font size="2">The final part feels almost like a review, cycling through the titles of the first seven parts -- but all of the episodes start this way, like it's a project continually building on itself. Godard's speaking through a weird space echo effect so he's really hard to understand, but thankfully there's subtitles for this part.  They don't really help me understand though.   The text here is insanely poetic, actually like a lot of the dialogue in his recent films.  There are allusions to zillions of films in the text, usually illustrated with those films, as throughout the whole series, though I don't recognize that many.  It's a longer episode, at 36 minutes, and about halfway through it starts to get into "death of the cinema" language, with "C'était le cinéma" appearing on screen a lot and some discussion about the power of images being distant and just, not brutal or shocking.  The difficulty of history itself is what I took from this; there's a line about how in this world we can achieve anything except the history of those achievements.   By the end I'm feeling so drained (since I knocked out these last 3 episodes in one sitting) that I don't know if there's anything else I can write here.</font></p><br /><br /><br /><br />29 January 2011<br />Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work<br />Ricki Stern, Anne Sundberg, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: <br />Fairly amazing look at Joan Rivers, creeping into almost Grey Gardens territory at times.  Rivers is an amazing construction, as the title implies, and full of contradictions.  Despite her insistence that she is an 'actress', we see her really shine in standup - the clips of her recent shows are absolutely hilarious, and I would have liked to see more.  Despite her ridiculous lifestyle and questionable attitudes (particularly noticeable when she plays in Wisconsin and acts like it's a third world country), she's kind to everyone in her life, regardless of status, and it's hard not to think of her somewhat sympathetically.  The film makes a lot of fuss about her being groundbreaking and boundary-pushing when she was younger, though the clips they show don't really back it up.  Her role in the overall history of female stand-up comedy is important though, and the film probably could have congratulated her even more than it did.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 January 2011<br />Lemmy<br />Greg Olliver, Wes Orshoski, USA, 2010<br />Location: Kino Sõprus<br />Format: DVD projected, incorrectly, in cinema<br />Company: others<br />They do the Docpoint festival in Tallinn also, albeit far smaller than the Helsinki one.  But, the films only cost 1.60€ for a ticket, which is so ludicrously cheap that I can't believe it.  And still, I want my money back.  This is one of the worst cinemagoing experiences I've ever had.  The most egregious offense was that the DVD (which was not advertised, as far as I could tell with my limited grasp of the Eesti language, as being a DVD projected) was shown with the wrong aspect ratio, with probably 1/3 of the film actually clipped off.  The aspect ratio was almost 1:1, and whenever there was text on screen, the beginning and/or end was cut off.  This wasn't noticeable just two or three times, but rather more like 30 or 40 times, and it amazes me that they didn't do anything about it.  The lights of the bar were left on, and I was sitting in the back near it, so it was rather irritating to have a glow behind me the whole time.  And worst of all (though not really the cinema's fault) was that a woman started drunkenly talking in the middle of the film, which led to more people yelling at her, someone screaming 'SHUT UP', and eventually the film being paused, the lights brought up, and the woman ejected from the cinema.  And, at the end of the film, the whole audience applauded, a LOT -- a standing ovation.  Now, that's something that irritates me almost as much as when Americans clap upon a plane landing, but a standing ovation for a shot-on-video documentary about Lemmy Kilmister?  I enjoyed the film because I like Motörhead and this was a fun documentary, but it wasn't <i>Citizen Kane</i>.  Now on to the film.  The filmmakers do their best to portray Lemmy as a man without flaws, and he comes across as extremely damn likeable.  He probably is as kind as he seems, totally fun, and the genuine deal.  They address his non-stop drinking and drugging but when interviewed about it, Lemmy refuses to say anything to endorse his own lifestyle, stating that it killed many of his friends and it's nothing to glorify.  That won me some points, moreso than all the shitty talking heads saying how much 'integrity' the guy has.  The Hawkwind footage was awesome, and when he joins Metallica on stage, he somehow manages to even make them sound good.  He's the real deal, and this is a pleasant journey into his life.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2011<br />Cyrus<br />Jay Duplass / Mark Duplass, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />What an excellent film.  As much as I love John C. Reilly as a comic actor, he's incredible in serious roles, and this was certainly that.  Although, especially in the early stages of the film, there were a lot of little gestures and Bruleisms that made me laugh.  It's an interesting character arc, as from the opening scene I thought this would be a film about a pathetic loser, and he turns out to make all of the right decisions and moves throughout.  I could tell early on this was going to descend into something incredibly dark and fucked up, and it did that without becoming outrageous.  Points to Jonah Hill too, cause this is a side of him I've never seen before either.  This might be the first of that mumblecore genre I've actually seen, but if they're all this solid, I have some catching up to do.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 February 2011<br />Due Date<br />Todd Phillips, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I don't really like Todd Phillips, but this was at least light on the misogyny.  There aren't any female characters at all except the wife (who only exists via phone link) so this remake of <i>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</i> was able to be a total guyfest.  Zach G is so funny that I actually enjoyed this film, but really only because of his weird stupid-guy jokes. When the film was just based in mundane back-and-forth Odd Couple jokes, <i>Due Date</i> was at its best - Zach saying that it would only take him 35 minutes to masturbate, the scene at the pot dealer's house, etc.  When Phillips tried to ramp up the crazyness by including action sequences and the big car chase, it kinda sucks.  Also, Downey spitting in a dog's face was memorable.  <i>Due Date</i> doesn't take any chances, but I didn't honestly expect any.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 February 2011<br />Historias extraordinarias<br />Mariano Llin&#xE1;s, Argentina, 2008<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This was a totally captivating, awesome film, and I give it my highest possible recommendation.  It reminded me of <i>Primer</i> because it was shot for barely anything and featured the writer, director and cinematographer in the three lead roles.  But as far as content goes, it was completely different.  This was a massive celebration of storytelling and fiction, being built around 3 long, convoluted adventures.  The amount of sheer mystery in these tales hangs over the whole film like a cloud.  The pervasive narration may be divisive to some people  - I sometimes feel like too much narration is a sign of weak writing, but in the case of <i>Historias extraordinarias</i> it's part of the story-based nature of the overall work.  There are parts where the narrator is even describing what is happening on screen as you're watching it - like the most literally translation of a text into film.  Greenaway would despise this for being just that, but I was totally drawn in.  Even though it was over four hours long I could have kept watching for much longer.  There's a really strange feeling to this entire film - besides the fact that all three stories revolve around land surveyors, civil engineers and other such local government activities.  It's not experimental at all - in fact it's almost shockingly conventional - yet somehow feels unlike anything I've ever seen before.  There's even weird diversions, like the tale of Lola Gallo, which are ultimately non-sequiturs , but in a film that is entirely non-sequiturs anyway.  There's not much actual acting here, as the actors are really just illustrating the narration, but the language is so carefully chosen that somehow I felt some really moving passages, but more from the narration than anything else!  Despite being no-budget there are some fantastically shot passages, like the tribute to <i>Rear Window</i>, all the scenes in the river, and the surprising animal scene in the middle.  I don't much about Argentinian culture besides Borges, but this is about as close to an illustration of his writing as I've ever seen in film - though filtered through Jacques Rivette, the only other filmmaker I could really think to compare this to.  Absolutely great.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 February 2011<br />??????????<br />Giorgos Lanthimos, Greece, 2009<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I feel like I should have a lot to say about this, but it's left me kind of speechless.  The opening act had me convinced this was going to be the closest to a film equivalent of Ben Marcus's fiction ever made, but unfortunately not -- the narrative unraveled into something actually set in our own reality, although it paints an incredibly fucked up and morbid world.  I'm not disappointed though - <i>Kynodontas </i>was unforgettable and captivating.  There are some twisted plot elements, but they almost become reasonable once you are immersed in this world.  This could probably be read as an attack on traditional Greek paternalism, though taken to a severe level; I actually was most intrigued by their world and in some perverse way, I wanted to live in it.  The look was perfect too -- everything was just so <i>neutral</i>.  I think this is something I will watch again despite it's dark nature and slow pace - because the ending is pure hope, right?  (Maybe).<br /><br /><br /><br />7 February 2011<br />Made<br />Jon Favreau, USA, 2001<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I always thought this was the sequel to <i>Swingers</i>, but it's not at all.  Just another Favreu-written film with him and Vaughn as the straight guy/asshole characters, though with an amateurish mob setting.  This was pretty uneven, never sure whether or not to commit to full comedy or serious gangster flick.  By being half of each it's pretty dull, and apart from the one scene with Vaughn opening the envelope early and reaching for the tape, there wasn't really anything remarkable.  Oh, except the scene with the penguins.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 February 2011<br />In Praise of Love<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 2001<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Back to the Godard tip, but there's only two left after this.  Godard's elegy to love was more about his love of filmmaking if anything.  I found this really inaccessible.  The first half was shot in black and white that made it look timeless -- it was actually hard to tell it was made only 10 years ago.  If this is a film about love I think it really must be looking at the more broad idea of love as opposed to just romantic love.  The subject matter seemed to be as much about politics and filmmaking as human relationships.  In the second half, we're suddenly bathed in rich, almost ridiculous colour.  The imagery becomes a bit more impulsive, with stop-motion shots and blurry scenes filmed frmo trains.  The colours were so washed out I thought maybe something was wrong with my TV.  Everything is grainy and meaty, if that makes any sense.  It was incredibly beautiful, but I found myself still not engaging with the dialogue much.  There was some criticism of American culture that didn't really seem very substantive, and then some by-now tired comments about the way films are financed.  It feels like yet another summary of everything he's done before, but with no urgency and not even that much focus.  But the first half of the film was strangely enjoyable, as it reminded me of <i>Une femme mairée</i> in the way it was filmed and the occasional monologues.  Overall I'd say this was pretty uneven, and not one I would ever watch again.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 February 2011<br />Get Low<br />Aaron Schneider, USA / Germany / Poland, 2009<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><i>Get Low</i> was pretty rough.  The story itself wasn't even that interesting, but it's hard to build up a character and make him mysterious in 45 minutes, then disassemble that in the same film and expect an audience to be invested enough.  I don't know if this was supposed to be a comedy, but it wasn't that funny.  Bill Murray was actually the weak link I think - he phoned this in, and his acting was pretty anachronistic.  Duvall was good enough but I found the big speech at the end to be pretty boring, and I was just waiting for it to be over.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 February 2011<br />Robinson in Ruins<br />Patrick Keiller, UK, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DVD on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Finding out there is a third <i>Robinson </i>film was incredible news, but I wanted to wait until the right time to watch it.  <i>Robinson in Ruins </i>takes place in 2008 and is concerned with the financial crisis and the machinations of governments and economics.  This positions it somewhat closer to <i>London</i> in terms of content, though it's photography is closer to <i>Robinson in Space</i>, being fixated on countrysides and industrial relics.  The style is immediately recognizable, as a fan of the first two films, though the presence of Vanessa Redgrave as narrator (as Paul Scofield has passed on) sets it apart somewhat.  There's a bit more of an abundance of nature photography - seemingly endless shots of insects, lichen and flowers - reminding me somewhat of my father's own slide photography from the 1970s.  Perhaps the most memorable passage is when the events of September 2008 are details -- the fall of Lehman Brothers, the shoring up of investmenet banks with US tax dollars - while we see a spider slowly spin its web.  From any other filmmaker this would probably be lame but it resonates with the overall <i>Robinson</i> vibe.  I don't think I enjoyed this as much as the first two, but maybe my expectations were too high.  The weirdo scholarship of Keiller's scrips felt a bit lackluster compared to the first two, but this was somewhat more focused on practical matters, almost like the intervening years shocked Robinson (who, we are told, was in prison) into seeing everything through the economic lens.  I will re-watch this because I found myself a bit less engaged than I expected to be, though it might be a product of my own mental state than anything else.  These films, now a trilogy, are among my favourite works in the history of British film and maybe just film, so this will surely reveal its charms after future study.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 February 2011<br />Notre musique<br />Jean-Luc Godard, France / Switzerland, 2004<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />The penultimate Godard feature is a stunner; <i>Notre musique </i>manages to stir the senses and emotions in a very economical 79 minutes.  Of all of his films that he appears in as an actor, this is the most natural performance by the man himself; his role as one who stumbles across the life of the main characters allows him to insert his usual probings of text + sound + image from his own voice, without dominating the story.  The actress who played Olga is phenomenal; the closeups convey complexity in the style that justifies the entire art of cinema.  The opening section of the film is a highly experimental montage of trauma and war scenes from other film, set to a haunting piano score (perhaps the music of the title).  I would think that this is Miéville's art direction taking over, except the similarity to <i>Histoire(s) du cinema</i> is striking.  It's a powerful, full-on beginning to any film, and once the second, main section begins (titled 'purgatory') it takes awhile to get going.  This is made in 2004 and the Iraq war is referred to in the sequence of newspapers on display, but Godard avoids any direct discussion of this or 9/11.  Instead we get his take on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, or at least one version of it (since his Dziga Vertov Group documentary on Arafat was never finished).  <i>Notre musique </i>tackles politics and ethnic identity through a personal lens, and it doesn't hurt that the film is set in Sarajevo.  The bookend to the opening montage is the 'paradise' coda, a beautiful and tranquil way to end the film after we learn of Olga's fate.  The photography is as lush and inviting as anything Godard ever did; it reminded me a little of bit of <i>Week End</i> only placid instead of anarchic.  There's a lot of complexity to this film which is enough to make me sad that my Godard project is coming to an end (though I really should be glad to move on).<br /><br /><br /><br />15 February 2011<br />Socialism<br />Jean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />And with this, I have now seen every feature film made by Jean-Luc Godard. Congratulations to me, I've wasted a tremendous amount of viewing time on marginalia of a director that I wouldn't even consider to be a favourite.  But my god, what an absolute stunner to end with.  The first 30 minutes of <i>Film socialisme</i> are maybe the best 30 minutes of the man's entire career, which is not just because it's his version of <i>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again</i>.  The style of this section is like a concentrated summation of 30 years of experiments with the video medium - when juxtaposed with film, the ability of each format to express different things is really pronounced, and the video blocks are just perfect.  The soundtrack as well, making full use of the stereo field, frequently employs digital clipping and there's an overall disassociative effect that sets this very much among contemporaries in art and experimental video - while retaining the mastery of an 80 year old iconoclast.  But what made this even more amazing was the way it was subtitled - the DVD did not provide full translations of all the dialogue (which was in many different languages anyway) but only two or three words at a time, conveying the 'gist' of it (except for when it was perhaps untrustworthy).  This almost perfectly mirrored my own comprehension of French but with different words being understood at times, so it colluded to form a really pluralistic approach to translation (while still being pleasingly incomplete).  The vapid, shallowness of these cruise ship patrons are an indictment of new Europe, most obviously, but there's more than just anger here.  The second and third movements - like <i>Notre musique</i>, this follows a 3 act structure with very distinct soundtracks - adhere more conventionally to the Godard film approach, or at least the middle one.  By the end, the politics have emerged and we're back to more experiments with video and sound, giving the whole thing an unusual balance.  Because I have watched all of his films chornologically, I've been constantly trying to find some sort of coherent narrative throughout his various experiments, but it's eluded me. There are clear themes that come and go throughout various periods, but it's hard with someone who has spent 50 years continually reinventing oneself  to see obvious patterns of development.  This film, on an aesthetic level, most perfectly brought together language, image and sound, while utilising the experimental nature of his work and classic cinematographic grandeur.  It might be crazy to say that this was the best Godard film of them all, but it's certainly one that I will watch repeatedly.  Given his age (and that this was made a full 50 years after <i>Breathless</i>) there might not be many more.  To create something (after a gap of 6 years) that is so aggressively innovative (yet almost shockingly relevant) is a real accompllishment.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 February 2011<br />Catch Me If You Can<br />Steven Spielberg, USA, 2002<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I wanted something fun and easy after an exhausting weekend in Stockholm.  Despite Hanks and DiCaprio being Bland and Blander, I wasn't bored at any point, as I enjoy con-artist films and you can't say Steven Spielberg doesn't make fun, accessible films.  I guess that was also nice because it didn't rely on special effects at all.  The opening titles suggested it would be more Hitchcock influenced, but it was really just a series of entertaining capers, at least when the emotional stuff was downplayed.  It felt like the conning ended a bit too abruptly, but I guess it was based on a true story.  I was fine with the superficial depth of this - no real investigation into the darkness that must come from fucking over everyone you meet -- because that's all I was looking for this afternoon.<br /><br /><br /><br />21 February 2011<br />Catfish<br />Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman, USA, 2010<br />Location: Köie flat<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><meta charset="utf-8"/> I don't think I'll ever watch this again, but it had the same curiously compelling and mildly disturbing magic as <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> (whose director was a producer on this). This is the real Facebook movie, not the fucking <i>Social Network</i>. Somehow this film is plagued with accusations that it's all an elaborate hoax (which makes 2010 a hell of a year for hoaxy documentaries after Bansky and Joaquin Phoenix).  But while <i>I'm Still Here</i>'s awesomeness rests entirely on its falsity, veracity doesn't really matter in this or the Banksy fil m- the value of these works concerns other topics. There's something insanely fascinating about watching these people send texts and Facebook messages; I don't know if that's a testament to brilliant no-budget filmmaking or a sad indictment of our times.  I really enjoyed this, but like <i>The Red Chapel</i> I enjoyed it because of how it raised questions about the ethics of the documenters themselves (though I don't know if that was actually the intent here).  The style of the film is a bit overmuch with the Google Earth-simulations, like it's battering my over the head with it, as if I didn't realise this is already a film about using Facebook. Though the rest of it is so cheap that it felt like some freely available Internet conspiracy film.  These types of situations are not really that shocking or surprising - I was hoping for something far weirder, and in a way, it's kind of a disappointing denouement.  But I did find myself getting drawn into its web, and really curious, and even excited, to see what was going to happen.  Maybe <i>Catfish</i> itself is all about the same smoke and mirrors that its characters create. I think the inherent lonliness of American life that this woman represented is so obvious that confronting it that explicitly almost seems like overkill, yet <i>Catfish</i> doesn't offer any sort of alternatives, except to exploit it to make a documentary film.  So, yeah, mixed feelings but high on the absolute value scale -- I just imagine I might feel very differently about this in a few days and decide I hate it.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 March 2011<br />Red<br />Robert Schwentke, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I wanted to fall asleep to something shitty, which this was, though it was shitty in a different way than I expected.  <i>Red</i> is actually a comic book movie, and a kinda fun idea that probably worked well as a graphic novel but totally failed to make the transition to the big screen.  The poor script and direction is probably the main cause of this; it was part comedy, part thriller, and part action movie, but not enough of either.  The scripted jokes were mostly terrible, though Malkovich brought everything to the table and kept me interested.  The violence was more explosions than gore, and occasionally ridiculous and cartoonish but then occasionally more "realistic", so the whole thing was extremely uneven.  So it wasn't shitty enough, but it certainly wasn't good. Ernest Borgnine was a nice touch though, and I wonder how Rebecca Pidgeon continues to get work.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 March 2011<br />Waiting for Superman<br />Davis Guggenheim, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><i>Waiting for Superman</i> probably should have gotten more attention, since I think it's the guy that made the Al Gore movie and it tugs on the heartstrings in the same way Michael Moore films do but in a much more level-headed, responsible-filmmaking way.  I actually got bored with this approach, instead preferring the segements that actually packed in information (the animations were classy and they helped).  It seemed like the filmmaker was quick to heroize Geoffrey Canada and Michelle Rhee, and lambast "bad teachers" without ever clearly explaining what that means.  I do think the issues at hand here are important, and the film doesn't diminish the severity of the problems, though I don't know if it offers any answers.  There isn't much hope here.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 March 2011<br />Enter the Void<br />Gaspar No&#xE9;, France / Germany / Italy, 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I feel like I have a lot to say about <i>Enter the Void</i>, though it's all thoughts about the technical and stylistic elements of the film, because despite all of this artifice, the film was pretty much substance-free.  In fact, it's the most majestically grandiose 2 hours and 33 minutes of vacuousness I've ever endured, but I guess it's called <i>Enter the Void</i> for a reason.  Sure, there's lots of TIbetan Book of the Dead stuff to "interpret", plus cyclical repetition and endless, endless shots of circular imagery - but to me, it all came off as juvenile horseshit.  I guess this is a Houellebecqian blanket of detachment, but I would have preferred some genuine mystery.  The worst thing about this was definitely the lengthy runtime, though the strobe effects and annoying circular camera movements were pretty painful too - I found myself just praying for a cut.  The dense, drony soundtrack was almost necessary to balance the hyperactive flashing lights and colours, or else the editor would have probably killed himself.   I had to crank the volume to hear what was going on overtop of all the discordant subsounds under the dialogue, but it was boring anyway. The psychedelic visuals aren't even that commendable - I was laughing at the first DMT trip, which felt like Jordan Belsen-cum-<i>F-Zero</i>, but that turned out to be the best part.  Actually <i>F-Zero</i> and videogames in general have a lot of influence on this, at least with the birds-eye view stuff that never seemed to quite get there.  When it wasn't the top-down look, it was like watching an unfunny episode of <i>Peep Show</i>.  Because I felt like I was in a coma (albeit a bright, colourful one with lots of transgressive sex and nudity) I guess Noé succeeded in making the powerful, provocative film he set out to make.  In a way I was reminded of recent David Lynch films, though minus all of the things that make recent David Lynch films good.  Instead of visceral ambiguity, we get bad flashbacks and strobe-effect surrealism, hey, did you see he was writing "I want to live" and then it changed to "I want to die"?  Trippy!  Now technically, this is some accomplishment, but it's gotta be diminished by the fact that the film itself was so fucking terrible.  I found myself at times thinking about <i>Mr. Nobody</i>, a film which I think has some similarities to <i>Enter the Void</i> (but a big difference, in that it's awesome).<br /><br /><br /><br />8 March 2011<br />Inside Job<br />Charles Ferguson, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This was a really well-done, big-budget documentary about those fucking horrible criminals that still roam this Earth unimprisoned, and the great injustice that it is.  With Matt Damon narrating!  This won the Oscar for best documentary, though a lot of people felt that <i>Waiting for Superman</i> was snubbed; I disagree - this was a far better film that did everything correctly, if a bit by-the-books.  The talking heads were a nice mix of supporting the argument and completely opposing it; occasionally the interviewees get testy, which is amusing.  Though most of the most horrible offenders (Geithner, Sumners, Bernanke, and of course Greenspan) refused to be interviewed.  On the 'technical' level of explaining the financial stuff, this was the perfect balance for me - it explained credit default swaps in a way that I could understand, without being too pandering.  I particularly enjoyed how in the last ten minutes, it really stepped up the pressure on the Obama administration for failing to do anything about the problems, and appointing many of these same criminals to his staff.  At this point I don't even feel like voting for him again, though I'm sure I'll be scared into it when Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin looks like they might actually win.  But yeah, maybe it's my own biases but this really stirred up some rage in me.  These people should be fucking strung up by their necks and tortured a good bit too for the utter suffering and misery that they inflicted upon the world.  The film was actually pretty restrained in passing judgement until the final moments, but it was very much appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 March 2011<br />The Cable Guy<br />Ben Stiller, USA, 1996<br />Location: Ptarmigan Eesti<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I never saw <i>The Cable Guy</i> but knew it was remembered poorly by most people; after seeing an article in Splitsider last week proclaiming it's hidden greatness, I decided to give this a go.  Well, I think I agree with the consensus.  <i>The Cable Guy </i>just isn't actually funny, or at least it's based entirely too strongly on whether or not you enjoy JIm Carrey's hijinks.  Matthew Broderick was also a bit tough to take as the straight guy, and its even more frustrating seeing a young Owen Wilson in there along with an in-his-prime Bob Odenkirk, yet also failing to connect.  The idea of a pop culture saturated maniac is actually a good thing to play around with, and Carrey's many references to old movies and TV shows is probably the strongest part of the film.  But for as 'dark' as <i>The Cable Guy</i> is supposed to be, it's not acidic enough for me.  The Jefferson Airplane karaoke with all the old people dancing is the best moment of the film, I'd say.  Ben Stiller is much better when he's directing something far more goofy - <i>Zoolander </i>and <i>Tropic Thunder</i>-style films are where his sensibilities lie, not this, which actually highlights his weakness as a director (at least in the way a director is responsible for bringing performances out of actors). Carrey clearly directed himself here, and everyone else just felt a little bit 'off'.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 March 2011<br />Easy A<br />Will Gluck, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I think this was probably the best of that "teen girl high school" film genre that I've seen, certainly better than <i>Juno</i> and I think a notch above <i>Mean Girls </i>too.  Beyond the fairly sophisticated way it deals with teenage sexuality, it was actually just really really funny.  The scenes with the family set up a comfort level that didn't overplay itself and actually had me wanting more; the teen actors were pretty good too.  This is pure saccharine when I want something easy but it delivered, and I would absolutely recommend it.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 March 2011<br />The Promotion<br />Steve Conrad, USA, 2008<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I wonder why I never knew this film existed?  I don't think anyone has seen it.  It's not that great, but not terrible - there's something charming and good-natured about it, reminding me a bit of <i>The Foot Fist Way</i>.  The universe of the supermarket is kind of a funny one to experience for 90 minutes, though <i>The Promotion</i> plays it completely safe.  John C. Reilly does an inconsistent Canadian accent, but he can do no wrong in my book.  This could have been a lot more political, particularly as it was made during the time of economic crisis in America.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 March 2011<br />The Ghost Writer<br />Roman Polanski, France / Germany / UK, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Afternoon film diversion in-between spackling/painting and coding work.  This was quite highly acclaimed by people I know, and I can see why - as these type of thrillers go, it's fairly entertaining and had a nice chunk of menace and paranoia that is altogether missing from these.  I wouldn't proclaim this to be a masterpiece or anything - it's no <i>The Constant Gardener</i> - but it was certainly a captivating 2 hours of cinema.  It certainly is cinema though - there were so many concessions to cinematic drama that it undermined the semi-relevance of making a film about Tony Blair.  McGregor is his usual bland self, but since he was supposed to be a 'ghost' it actually worked well; I also enjoyed some of the details about the English and American interactions, which were always cast in a somewhat alien context.  This is ultimately fluff despite it's aspirations of being something more grandiose, and Brosnan does a wonderfully authentic prime ministerial figure.  I would recommend this to people looking for something "political" and conspiracy-oriented , yet contemporary - I wouldn't actually say this is actually that amazing though.  I do like how the overall argument (spoiler alert) is that Cherie Blair is actually the root of all evil and Tony was just a puppet.  Nice work, Polanski.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 March 2011<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ptarmigan Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: Kadri Klementi<br />Had masala dosas and then watched <i>Little Murders</i> which i haven't seen in awhile.  Yep, this is still my favourite film ever.  I felt like I watched it to death a few years ago, but I enjoyed every second of it.  Kadri seemed to be captivated by it too.  There's something nice about familiarity; after seeing this so many times, I feel like I know every beat, yet I still saw things in a new way.  For example, Donald Sutherland's performance, which I've always loved, is so manic and awkward ,and he speaks in this weird accent the whole time - -it just struck me as more strange than anything.  I love how uncompromising this is, and how philosophical it can be, though I still think differently about the "meaning" of the ending every time.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 March 2011<br />Winter&#x27;s Bone<br />Debra Granik, USA, 2010<br />Location: newly created Ptarmigan media room<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I expected some typical indie-film mystery, and I guess this had elements of that, but I was surprised to find this to be such a distinctly composed portrait of Appalachian lowlifes.  Visually, I thought this was one of the more beautiful things I have seen in awhile; it certainly stirred up some feelings about that part of America in me, and I could have just lost myself in the trees and the leaves.  Narratively, it surprised me too - I thought early on it would be a quest film, just a girl looking for her father, and I guess it was that, but it shifted a few times and I genuinely didn't know where it would end up.  At times I felt like the filmmakers were too focused on showing this type of life, almost to create shock value, and it started to detract from my enjoyment of the film.  I guess that's more on me than the film, but I wonder how someone from this region would see this film.  It's hard for me to tell how much of this was exaggerated, and the performances were quite convincing - the main actress is stunning, and I wonder if she will become a star.  I guess if anything I would have like <i>less</i> plot; this could have been a more impressionistic riff on this lifestyle and I might have been less distracted by the story.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 April 2011<br />The Chaser<br />Hong-jin Na, South Korea, 2008<br />Location: TV room<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Much thanks to Daron and Gil for this recommendation - wow, what a nearly perfect thriller, clearly influenced by <i>Memories of Murder</i> and just as entrancing if not quite living up to <i>MoM</i>'s standard of artistic brilliance.  But <i>The Chaser</i> was so great - I love the way it had me cheering for an abusive pimp as a hero, and the scenes with the police were insanely fascinating.  The acting was what really did it, though.  The killer was phenomenal; and the cops, even the ones with minor roles, totally killed it.  I don't know enough about the intricacies of Korean law (ok, I don't actually know anything at all about Korean law) but it seems insane that they would have to release someone who had made a confession for lack of evidence.  But if anything, <i>The Chaser</i> was an indictment of police incompetence as well as a cautionary tale against prostitution.  I loved the little flavors around the edges of this - the dog, for example - and the minor subplot about the mayor getting shit thrown on him was really a great non-sequitur that did a ton to set the mood (and isn't really a subplot, I guess).<br /><br /><br /><br />25 April 2011<br />The Golden Child<br />Michael Ritchie, USA, 1986<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Adam's recent watching of this piqued my interest, and it was the perfect bit of nonsense to lay on the couch and watch after all the stress of the previous week.  This wasn't as bizarre as I expected, but also not as good.  I did enjoy it because it packed things into a tight, economical 90 minutes and Eddie Murphy was at the peak of his powers, after all.  Some of the better parts I suspect were improvised and I wish they would have cut him a little more loose.  It's interesting that this, Indiana Jones 2 and Big Trouble in Little China all came out at approximately the same time; sadly, this is probably the film that deals with the other cultures in the most mature and respectful way out of the three.  I liked the special effects and I'm trying to remember if they were good for their time.  Murphy is also the least 'black' I've seen him, as opposed to something like <i>48 Hrs</i> where they weren't trying to sell him to a white audience, since Nolte could carry that part of the film.  I enjoyed the same incidental music style that Ritchie used in <i>Fletch</i>, though <i>Fletch </i>is the far far better film.  I should see the rest of Ritchie's filmography though.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 April 2011<br />Shakes the Clown<br />Bobcat Goldthwait, USA, 1991<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I thought that after watching the directorial works of Jean-Luc Godard in chronological order, that maybe the directorial works of Bobcat Goldthwait might be a nice followup plan. (And significantly less daunting).  <i>Shakes the Clown</i> has its followers, specifically McDowell and Martin Scorcese, but I'm not so sure about it.  An alcoholic clown tale is certainly appetising, but there's too many factors in this film that prevent me from feeling it was good.  The worst offender would be Julie Brown's character with the exaggerated speech impediment.  I did enjoy the fantasy world of Palookaville, the clowns vs. mimes rivalry, Robin Williams' absolutely destroying it, and the fact that this was a period piece (sort of).  This was one of Adam Sandler's earliest roles, which he does well; Tom Kenny was a pretty powerful Binky (and now I understand where the R.E.M. song title 'Binky the doormat' comes from) and Bobcat himself was extremely convincing. What's strange to me is that a film about clowns was done without any surrealism whatsoever, which I guess was a conscious choice, but instead of creating a strange juxtaposition, <i>Shakes the Clown</i> comes off as somewhat of a mistake. Despite Paul Dooley.  File under whatever category <i>Cold Dog Soup</i> goes in.<br /><br /><br /><br />27 April 2011<br />Windy City Heat<br />Bobcat Goldthwait, USA, 2003<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />OK, the problem with this is that the whole film is centered around a joke, that they are all pulling a prank on one guy.  But it becomes clear about five minutes in that the guy is in on it too, so the whole thing is a fake prank, and that's pretty stupid, right?  The thing is, if instead of pretending it was a real prank, and they just made this a film about a stupid guy cast in a shitty film with all these idiots, then it would have been just as good.  Because there are actually some really funny parts of <i>Windy City Heat</i>, except it's all undercut by the fake prank thing.  All of the names of the fake people, like Hiroshima Nagasaki and Ansel Adams, made me laugh repeatedly and the Perry Caravello guy is totally great to watch throughout.  So this was almost a guilty pleasure in how enjoyable it was, except, as I mentioned, it sucked because of the fake prank thing.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 April 2011<br />Sleeping Dogs Lie<br />Bobcat Goldthwait, USA, 2006<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Bobcat Goldthwait's more recent work really steps it up a notch.  This was a no-budget labour of love, and it restrains the over-the-top 80's style Goldthwait in favour of a more restrained approach that ends up being far darker and quite serious.  Though this had the production and feel of a Cinemax film minus the sex, it worked because the script and cast were so expertly handled.  The woman who played Anna Draper was phenomenal in the lead role and Geoff Pierson shows that he can do far more than being the President of Showbuisness that he was in <i>Windy City Heat</i>.  I of course enjoyed Steve Agee and Brian Posehn's small roles, and felt like this was actually a good film even beyond the weird concept driving the plot.  It's not amazing or anything, but the ending hints at a genuine misanthrophy that is far more effective than, say, <i>Shakes the Clown</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 April 2011<br />World&#x27;s Greatest Dad<br />Bobcat Goldthwait, USA, 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I finished the tetrology of Goldthwait-directed films and I think it's safe to say that each one was better than the last.  I'm not a big Robin Williams fan - if anything, I'm very much not a fan, though listening to his <i>WTF</i> session made me a little bit more receptive to him - and I have to say this is pretty solid. I didn't know how the plot was going to twist and like <i>Sleeping Dogs Lie</i>, this explored some really dark aspects of the human soul while masquerading as a fairly mainstream film.  I like how shitty the kid was; Goldthwait made him truly awful, without anything loveable underneath, and his misbehaving at the beginning is genuinely fucked up and uncomfortable.  I thought these Goldthwait films would be more wall-to-wall funny and surreal, but they're surprisingly accessible, and perhaps more subversive because of that.<br /><br /><br /><br />3 May 2011<br />Coming to America<br />John Landis, USA, 1988<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I don't know why I'm choosing Eddie Murphy movies as a procrastination tool but I might have run out of 'em unless I want to try <i>Harlem Nights</i> or <i>Boomerang</i> (and even those are a bit too late I suspect).  <i>Coming to America</i> is one I somehow never saw before, and I expected it to be extremely raunchy and over the top, but instead found a sweet romantic fairy tale.  It's funny though, maybe not consistently so (when it has to slow down to advance the story, I got bored).  The winning move was structuring this around Murphy and Arsenio's talents in sketch comedy, so you have them playing multiple characters, far better than the lead roles.  I coulda taken the whole movie inside the barber shop probably.  I think I found the humour far tamer than I expected; maybe I should watch <i>Delirious </i>instead.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 May 2011<br />Stranger Than Fiction<br />Marc Forster, USA, 2006<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />The way this started I thought it was going to be great - Will Ferrell in a semi-serious role, and a strange, highly metafictional plot.  I enjoyed watching this and was never bored, but the story soon turned into schmaltz, and not even romantic schmaltz - more like structural schmaltz.  When the film was just trying to be engaging and entertaining it was pretty sucessful; Ferrell actually was great in the role though I kept expecting him to go off in a silly nonsensical rant becuase that's just how we're used to him.  Dustin Hoffmann reminds me of his role in <i>Huckabees</i>, and Buster Bluth was really good in his small role.  It was weird randomly choosing to watch this right after finishing <i>The Pale King</i> because it's amazingly close to the novel, at least in the sense that it's about an IRS Regional Examination Centre (I assume Ferrell was a GS-9) and also involved the same metafictional conceits that DFW put into his book - the author becoming part of fiction, at least in some remote way.  I mean, it's not like we're going to actually see an adaptation of any of Wallace's writing, so this is kind of fun to imagine as what Hollywood would do to his book.  Except, of course, that it came out 2 years before DFW's suicide and five years before the book, but that goes without saying.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 May 2011<br />The Mechanic<br />Simon West, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Mid-afternoon Jason Statham movie time!  This was as shitty as I expected, but actually amongst the Statham canon it's probably one of the better features (<i>The Bank Job</i> and <i>Revolver</i> not counting, of course).  The action sequences were good enough and it didn't overstay its welcome.  I'm always a bit disappointed that these films never explore their own decrepit moral conundrums; you could really investigate the whole "following orders" hero-assassin bullshit, re: the Nazis and the holocaust, probably in a way that wouldn't compromise the asskicking action scenes.  This film had that - driving a car into a bus was pretty good, as well as the brutal nearly-botched first murder that Ben Foster commits.  There was never really any point in which Statham's awesomeness was in jeopardy, so I found myself not even feeling invested in the same level that shit like the <i>Transporter</i> trilogy did.  I could have lived without seeing this, of course, but it was nice to turn off my mind in the midst of an intense coding day.  In a recent <i>Doug Loves Movies </i>podcast, Jeff Garlin stated that Statham is such an amazing movie star, but he takes the shittiest scripts possible.  That's not really a clever insight but it makes me almost wonder if he just has incredibly bad taste and he actually thinks these films are brilliant, evocative and artistic.<br /><br /><br /><br />7 May 2011<br />I Am Comic<br />Jordan Brady, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />No-budget documentary that really looks at the day-to-day life of a comic, getting into issues rarely discussed in public forums.  There were enough funny people in this that I didn't get bored, though structuring it around the unretirement of Ritch Shydner was somewhat annoying because he wasn't that funny and I wasn't really interested in him. Carlos Mencia actually comes off as good in this, which should say something about who he was up against.  I was hoping a bit more for an investigation into how dark and fucked up comedians can be, and the role of comedy as therapy, but this was only dealt with in the most surface of manners.  The HBO special <i>Talking Funny</i> blows this away, although I guess they are addressing different issues.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 May 2011<br />House of Cards<br />John Guillermin, USA, 1968<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Pretty good thriller, with a recurring theme of George Peppard having to escape some enclosing structure (house, compound, and colliseum).  Could have done with more Orson Welles, but that's probably applicable to any film.  Peppard is almost gloriously crap here, with a brash, oafish American hero that's wedged against fascist old Europe moneyed personalities.  But the network of evil that emerges makes the film pretty gripping; the action/chase sequences are good, and the overall pace was snappy enough to make up for some cheeseball dialogue.  A few plot twists were a bit much (plastic surgery?) but I was definitely into this.  Bonus points for the jazz/rock soundtrack during some of the chase scenes, which had a killer echo effect on the brass instruments.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 May 2011<br />Our Brand Is Crisis<br />Rachel Boynton, USA, 2005<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I have a massive amount of contempt for these neoliberal suited fucks, who in my opinion are culpable in the election of George W Bush and his subsequent reign of terror.  Their focus groups and calculated, dehumanising approaches to politics made the Democratic party a false shell of what it once represented, sinking into the moral disorder of Clinton's policies and leading to an ultimately cynical, horrifying and incorrect vision of how to win elections.  Despite Obama's slide into the same mediocrity, I'm thankful every day that his campaign broke against this nonsense.  So watching a film that explores their inner workings was quite pleasing to me, especially as their skewed ideas of "exporting democracy" crumbled around them.  The very idea that they could bring their ideas to Bolivia and find success, in a country where they not only aren't from but don't even speak the language, is arrogant and obnoxious.  The success of Evo Morales, though the film is careful not to judge him is almost like a triumph of the people over the focus groups. I have no sympathy for Goni, the Bolivian candidate, who is nothing but a pro-globalisation hack.  Hearing Carville and the other consultant (who is like the perfect cross between Jeff Goldblum and Ben Stiller) still clinging to their neoliberal fallacies after everything has fallen apart is probably the best part.  Very nicely done.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 May 2011<br />Eddie Murphy Delirious<br />Bruce Gowers, USA, 1983<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I had vague memories of seeing this standup concert video when I was young, but maybe it was Eddie Murphy <i>Raw</i> that I actually remembered.  I definitely remember the red leather suit.  The humour in this was so horribly homophobic and misogynistic that I felt pretty uncomfortable at times, but there were some great funny parts.  Murphy's "white guy voice" never fails to make me laugh and seeing all of this cockyness and bravado is something, even if it's not necessarily a positive thing.  There's no insecurity whatsoever projected to this audience, unless you can see through the facade.  The ice-cream man routine was the highlight for me, as I definitely like the more nonsensical and silly side instead of the hateful anti-gay stuff.  I guess this comedy defined a generation, though really it just seems like Richard Pryor with less insightful social commentary and a  far larger stage (and also removing everything daring).<br /><br /><br /><br />14 May 2011<br />Eddie Murphy Raw<br />Robert Townsend, USA, 1987<br />Location: Ptarmigan studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br />Eddie Murphy's second standup was far less enjoyable to me. Somehow, a standup film managed to be overblown, with a huge introductory skit that wasn't actually funny, and Murphy's own silhouette projected like he's some sort of god.  Which he clearly felt he was at the time, and given his box-office draw in 1987, I understand that.  The misogyny was far worse in this set, with most of it seeming to be about how men cheat on their 'bitches' and the various predictable routines that come from that.  I must have seen parts of this before, because I remember the part about 'salad-eatin' bitches' which is about the level this was at.  The section where he talks about Bill Cosby complaining about his swearing is probably the best, just because it's a really inaccurate Cosby impersonation.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 May 2011<br />Jour de f&#xEA;te<br />Jacques Tati, France, 1949<br />Location: Piip ja Tuut Mängumaja<br />Format: DVD on screen via projector<br />Company: Epp, Toomas, their friends<br />The clowns were screening some Tati films in the evenings this week so I went over to check out <i>Jour de Fête</i>, which I thought I had maybe seen before but I don't think I had.  This is early Tati, and he played François the postman who was in all honesty pretty simliar to M. Hulot.  This was definitely an <i>Amarcord</i>esque village portrait, and I thought it was going to be about the romance between two of the other characters before Tati finally entered the picture.  From that point on it became the charming madcap romp that I expected, though not quite as filled with the awe and wonderment of <i>Playtime</i>.  The sense of alienation with the modern world is in full effect though, as the 'plot' concerned François and his jealousy at the more advanced, motorised postal system in America.  A few random elements of the film were colourised, as Tati wanted it to be, but just the banners that hang during the party and a few occasional lights, so it was actually a pretty neat effect.  I was also really aware of the foley sound, which was out of control - there were chickens clucking throughout the entire film, and the soundtrack was even more busy than the carefully choregraphed scenes of physical group comedy.  This was watched with Finnish subtitles and I found it pretty difficult to concentrate - I can't read enough Finnish to completely follow the (albeit simple) dialogue, and the French was really hard to hear, perhaps because it was country people in 1949, or perhaps because I was confused and overwhelmed by the Suomeksi teksti. I probably got about 70% of it though.<i> </i><br /><br /><br /><br />7 June 2011<br />Monsters<br />Gareth Edwards, UK, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This British-made sci-fi/horror film surprised me with its restraint; I found myself quite drawn in, and enjoying the slow tension in both the monsters and the relationship.  I feared this would be more like <i>District 9</i> with the obvious "America builds a wall to keep out monsters" idea, but this isn't really explored, thankfully.  I did spend the whole movie thinking about how glad I was that these monsters weren't humanised at all, another thing that made <i>District 9</i> so awful, but then the ending sorta did, yet still in a different way.  The lead actor was pretty Keanu-like but I did actually like this, though it's been awhile since I've been able to lie down and enjoy a film, so maybe I just wanted to get lost in something.  This didn't really do many standard suspense/horror/action things, and the special effects were somewhat cheap, which actually worked to make this feel otherwordly.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 June 2011<br />The Green Hornet<br />Michel Gondry, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />With this, Gondry has become immersed completely in the language of commercial filmmaking.  There was pretty little here that resembled the playful exuberance of <i>The Science of Sleep</i>; the scene where Seth Rogen puts together all of the clues is the only glimpse of that, and it's short.  As a superhero movie, I suppose this wasn't terrible, but that's because my standards are lower for superhero movies.  The problem actually wasn't Rogen, whose oafish bumbling was a nice contrast to the usual heroics, but to the script which had to deal the typical pressures of the origin story and did so in a clumsy, rushed manner.  Rogen of course makes this into an Apatow-like bromance - is this the only type of film he's capable of making?   I don't mind some humour, especially since the Green Hornet is a somewhat lame superhero anyway, but this wasn't actually funny - I found myself hoping for more car chases and action scenes, which is rare.  The dude from <i>Inglorious Basterds</i> was so much less scary and evil with a neurotic side, and the film's LA failed to commit to either fantasy or reality wholly.  I fell asleep in the office watching this and woke up this morning to finish it, which felt somewhat decadent, but I guess watching superhero movies alone in your office isn't really decadent at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />16 June 2011<br />Cedar Rapids<br />Miguel Arteta, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><i>Cedar Rapids</i> was way, way better than I expected.  It managed to do that Apatow-style thing of having a nice, heartwarming pro-moral story at the core while still sketching out goofy characters and having some off-colour humour - though while less funny than an Apatow outing, it's also a lot less problematic.  Ed Helms's acting was erratic, at times being genuinely convincing and balanced, and at other times going off the deep end.  But like <i>Punch Drunk Love</i>, that's one way to portray repression.  John C Reilly is again really great and his character was far more complex that I expected.  I thought this would be filled with some of my least favourite stereotypes about comedy movies, like "the hooker with the heart of gold" (played by <i>Arrested Development</i>'s Maybe) but it took a more nuanced route.  The central joke of this film, that Cedar Rapids, IA is some sort of big-city den of decadence, isn't beaten into the ground, and overall I'm happier with a "nice" throwaway comedy like this than the mean-spirited Farelli Bros/<i>Shallow Hal</i> shit that was going around for awhile.  Misogyny is pretty much under control too apart from Reilly's frequent use of the word 'pussy', and he's a flawed hero anyway.  The Senator Clay Davis/metafictional <i>Wire</i> shit is pretty funny too and it's nice to see his comic side come out.<br /><br /><br /><br />17 June 2011<br />Hall Pass<br />Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I tend to group mainstream Hollywood comedy into two groups - horrible, mean-spirited misogynist shit and the slightly better "Bucket Brigade" comedies.  For some reason I thought this fell into the latter category, but I didn't realise this was a Farrelly Bros film until it was over, or else I probably wouldn't have watched it.  It was horrible, yes; misogynistic, stupid, and only funny at one point, when Jason Sudekis gets caught wanking his his car.  Jenna Fischer is as excrutiating as usual, and Owen Wilson is such a joke now.  I was trying to fall asleep and somehow stayed awake through this whole thing, which is why it ends up on my PBT.  I need to start challenging my brain more. I could TRY to defend this as a film that actually humiliates it's male characters and criticises their sex-crazed behaviour, but since the film ultimately reinforces heterosexual monogamy, I'm not going to try.  Also, the way the "friends" were a really fake assortment of multi-ethnic stereotypes was pathetic, even if JB Smoov is funny.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 June 2011<br />Submarine<br />Richard Ayoade, UK / USA, 2010<br />Location: Kino Sõprus<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Lewis McGuffie<br />Price includes one A. Le Coq draught beer.  Lots of expectations for this film, which is the directorial debut I think of Richard Ayoade who's impact on British comedy has been immeasurable over the past several years - this guy has had a hand in everything great, and he's always gonna be Dean Lerner to me.  Anyway, this film is extremely Welsh but situated in that magical kind of wonky aesthetic that made me insanely longful for the UK.  Though set ostensibly in a contemporary mileu, <i>Submarine</i> is drenched in the aesthetics of a time past, but not any specific time - rather a non-defineable blip that finds equal course for modern singer-songwriter music (amazingly good songs by the Arctic Monkeys guy) and wood-paneled, house-on-a-hill Welsh seascapes.  As over-the-top as the Graham character was, <i>Submarine </i>is never really unreal, even though the lead character is so maturely narrated (and acted, despite occasionaly teenage behaviour) that it feels more akin to a Don DeLillo precociousness.  Child actors are always hard to pull off well but this film would have been impossible without Craig Roberts absolutely fucking nailing it.  The parents are also exaggerated, yet great - the scene that parodies 1970's "open university" videos while explaining that his father didn't know what to do with his hands is probably the funniest.  Throughout, <i>Submarine</i> is very very funny without being too ludicrous, and it balances this humour with insanely bittersweet sentimentality.  Although I love Wes Anderson movies, whose <i>Rushmore</i> it's impossible to not compare this too, I often find myself on-guard with these types of indie/coming-of-age/romance films.  The fact that there was a trailer for a new Miranda July film made me especially cautious about giving in to this, but I didn't last long - <i>Submarine</i> is wonderful in every possible way, and an absolute achievement.  I will be seeing this again and hopefully I won't harden to it like I have done with other heartstring-tugging films in the past.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 June 2011<br />Hot Fuzz<br />Edgar Wright, UK / France, 2007<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I enjoyed <i>Hot Fuzz</i> throughout, as after seeing <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> I have a sense of Edgar Wright's kinetic style of comedy construction.  This could probably be picked apart for it's attempt to moralise everything simply into good or evil, but I think that's missing the point as this is really just intended to be entertaining which it was.  Jokes are good; Simon Pegg was particularly enjoyable, showing his versatility; I'll probably never go to a Somerfield in the same way.  I suspect I should go back and check out <i>Spaced</i> next.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 August 2011<br />Stardust Memories<br />Woody Allen, USA, 1980<br />Location: Amtrak Pennsylvania route between Pittsburgh and NYC<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br />For some reason I downloaded this and decided to watch it again, since I had only previously seen a terrible pan &amp; scan VHS copy from the Carnegie Library.  I loved this even then, but really loved it now.  It's definitely one of my favourite Woody Allen films, though I wonder how many times I've said that in these writeups.  The Fellini aspect was more charming than derivative, and I think he really brought a lot of himself to the table.  Charlotte Rampling is amazing in her role as the insane Dorrie; her performance is unhinged and powerful and weighs the film with a real heavyness despite the strange and surreal interludes.  The juxtapositon of humour with the serious is somehow done without feeling kludged together; I can't help but think this is the ultimate seriocomic Allen film, much more so than the overrated <i>Manhattan.  </i>Great crisp photography and it was nice watching this on a train, even on my laptop, particularly since the film begins and ends with train scenes.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 August 2011<br />Super<br />James Gunn, USA, 2010<br />Location: Amtrak train to NYC; studio in Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (ext. monitor in Tallinn)<br />Company: none<br />I found <i>Super</i> totally apalling, which won't surprise anyone familiar with my tastes.  I thought this might be funny and I guess I chuckled a few times, but like <i>Kick Ass</i>, this is another film that attempts to deconstruct superhero genres but ultimately reinforces the terrible violence and simplistic ethics behind them all.  This was super gory, at least far more gory than a superhero farce needed to be; there was also a lot of R-rated sexual humour mixed throughout, but none of it particularly funny.  It's interesting how popular TV shows like <i>Mad Men</i>, <i>The Wire</i>, and <i>Breaking Bad</i> are so good because of the way they take a nuanced, pluralistic stance towards morality and ethics; but in Hollywood, superhero shit is insanely black and white, even moreso when it tries to be something more (cough, <i>The Dark Knight</i>) and with the exception of course of <i>Watchmen</i> (still in my opinion the best superhero movie ever).  Now <i>Super</i> proves a few things - that Rainn Wilson is not ready to be a leading man, and that Kevin Bacon is pretty entertaining even when given a pile of dogshit like this.  I guess this was slightly less reprehensible than <i>Kick Ass</i> because the violent, sexualised female sidekick was at least 22 years old here (though Ellen Page was so awful and annoying that I was glad when she was written out of it).  But like that film, <i>Super</i> failed to explore what happens when a person commits an act of murder, even if they feel it's justified (none of the violence that Wilson's character commits is in any way necessary, and the ending scene, though pleasantly bleak for his character, attempts to be reflective after-the-fact in the most superficial of manners).  Whereas in <i>Breaking Bad</i>, looking at the Jesse character the last few episodes, it's fucking amazing.  I realise there were three seasons in which to build up to that in <i>BB</i> vs about 40 minutes in <i>Super</i>, but I'm still going to hold that against this film.  But there's no repercussions here - it's stupid to look for plot holes, but we don't even touch on any legal fallout or the fact that a police officer is found dead in his flat, which suggests an excised subplot/director's cut that I'll never watch.  And on a purely technical level - I didn't mind the low-budget nature and shitty special effects (in fact, I'd say that was one of the redeeming features) but the pacing was terrible, as the first half-hour took absolutely ages to get through.  I do enjoy the concept of a superhero deconstruction, which is why I keep watching these, though I need to get past <i>Watchmen</i> cause nothing is ever going to do it as well, and certainly not while trying to be a comedy.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 August 2011<br />The Shining<br />Stanley Kubrick, UK / USA, 1980<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I have never gotten around to seeing this until now, no doubt because I was so familiar with all of the parodies and cultural references to it in other media.  But that's no excuse, so I gave it a go, and found it far more powerful than I imagined.  This film more than almost any other illustrates the differences between a film and a book.  Steve King is TOTALLY Garth Marenghi - on paper, this would be awful, another hackneyed supernatural horror story.  But in the hands of Kubrick's visual and directorial style, it becomes something far greater than the sum of its parts. The rendering of interior space is what makes this so amazing and powerful - the obvious antecedents are <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> and <i>Suspiria.  </i>All of these try to address the interior worlds we create to shape ourselves, and illustrate psychological distortions caused by this mediation.  <i>The Shining</i> is all about slow pans, even from the opening scene of driving outdoors which is the only time the camera has any sort of freedom.  The claustrophobia begins, and of course the exaggerated colours of the carpets, interior decorations and other aspects of the hotel made me feel mad like the characters, also reminding me of Gilliam's acid scenes in <i>Fear and Loathing</i>.  Through the art direction, cinematography, and especially the soundtrack, a quotidian horror narrative is transformed into something beautiful and unsettling, and it is really worthy of it's fame and influence. The axe-through-door scene, even though I knew it was coming, is undeniably compelling movie magic.  The performances are pretty stellar, and it doesn't really matter what that last shot might mean (I didn't care).<br /><br /><br /><br />14 August 2011<br />            Your Highness<br />David Gordon Green, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan main room<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: none<br /><i>Your Highness</i> is suprisingly above average for what on paper is incredibly stupid.  And actually, on celluloid (or whatever films are made on these days) it is as stupid as promised, but not annoyingly stupid and actually kinda funny and watchable.  The accents are hilarious because Danny McBride barely even tries to keep his, and James Franco (who is certainly capable of it) also gives up about partway through.  The humour was juvenile but not mean-spirited or overly misogynistic; the special effects were wonderfully shitty and I found time to pass well.  McBride isn't Kenny Powers here, but he's at least joined by the, um, "talents" of David Gordon Green, who can't even really be depended on to make his films look good anymore.  As each DGG film has gotten progressively more lowbrow, I'm curious where he'll go next.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 August 2011<br />Paul<br />Greg Mottola, Spain / France / UK / USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan main room<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: none<br />I wanted to do this, <i>Your Highness</i> and <i>Hamlet 2</i> as a triple feature of stupidity, but I think I'm too tired to do <i>Hamlet 2</i>.  Maybe it's just the mood I'm in tonight but I really enjoyed <i>Paul</i>.  It's not about being a cute CGI alien movie at all - the humour is quite R-rated and I'm not exactly sure where the audience is.  Pegg and Frost do well in constructing a genuinely balanced script, and I would say I far prefer this to Mottola's last film, <i>Adventureland</i>, which was a little too soft for me.  Somehow the cute CGI alien movie isn't as soft ... great conceit that the alien serves as an expert consultant to Hollywood alien movies.  Also it's nice when any mainstream movie points out that Christianity is a big stupid lie.  With all the films celebrating geek culture lately, this one isn't mocking at all, just genuinely appreciative (which is usually how it works with Pegg n' Frost).  I wonder how this would have been different had Edgar Wright directed it.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 September 2011<br />            Deux fois<br />Jackie Raynal, France, 1968<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: Liminal Images attendees<br />I've started a new monthly program called <i>Liminal Images</i> to screen old experimental cinema and other oddities that predate the video/Youtube age.  This is really just a way for me to make myself watch some of the stuff I download and to try to get more involved with the history of experimental film culture, which I supposedly love.  I put together two selections from the Zanzibar movement for the first event, of which <i>Deux fois</i> makes it into PBT because it was feature-length.  I actually don't know how much I can say about it.  Raynal's film doesn't fit into the narrative of experimental cinema as I know it.  If it's about anything, it's about repetition and mundanity, but even these patterns are sloppy and incoherent at times.  <i>Deux fois</i> was simultaneously incredibly dull and completley bonkers.  When there was sound, the sound was usually really radically disconnected from the image, but processed in some way to make it feel otherworldly.  The opening sequence, filmed around Raynal eating, is pretty amazing - it's more invasive and intimate than many sex scenes, and the soundtrack is digusting but undefinable.  There were some great moments here, but I don't know that I'd ever watch it again.  But radicalism can come in many ways, and here it was more form/content than overt political expression.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 September 2011<br />            Everything Must Go<br />Dan Rush, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Will Ferrell taking on a dramatic role -- not so surprising, after seeing <i>Stranger than Fiction</i>, though this was much more serious and straight-ahead than that film.  But <i>Everything Must Go</i> is not pure sadness - there are many small moments of comedy which Ferrell is of course a master of.  I was impressed by his composure in the more emotional scenes of this film, and I would say 'kudos' to Mr. Ferrell for the performance, but it didn't save the film itself from being a bit formulaic and Hallmarky.  I certainly didn't want to turn it off, but as a character study it lacked the intensity I think it could have had.  His turnaround happens so quickly, almost a blink-and-you-miss-it moment, that it feels a bit rushed and unrealistic (he quits drinking overnight?).  The suburban affluence is saturated throughout without any sense of criticism; though when Ferrell's character returns to his house, at the end, it's hard to know if it's triumphant or a sad resignation.  I would have liked more Glenn Howerton, of course.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 September 2011<br />            Melancholia<br />Lars von Trier, Denmark / Sweden / France / Germany, 2011<br />Location: Artis<br />Format: 35mm in cinema<br />Company: Pire Sova<br />I took a week to collect my thoughts about <i>Melancholia</i>, hoping that in the intervening time they would coagulate into something concrete.  But it's been a week and I still don't feel very strongly about this film in any way, which is ultimately why it must be a disappointment.  The most interesting thing about this was the way it continually juxtaposed extremes.  Cinematographically, it opens with a extremely fantastic sequence of slow, computer-assisted images, designed to represent the most outrageous imaginative vision as film can only do.  (Which actually felt much more like a video game than film, and I don't mean that kindly).   But then the actual film was constructed from the usual shaky camera, with close and personal intrustions as Von Trier is known for.  (Though, I realise I haven't seen any of his work since <i>The Idiots</i>, which was from 1998!).  The shakyness actually made me physically ill, in conjunction with the front-row seat we got stuck with and the too-hot nature of the cinema.  But the structure of the film itself continued to slam close, intimate human drama against the distant sci-fi dystopia of the world ending; these extremes I guess were created for this exact reason -- to contextualise trauma and use scale as a subjectifying device.  The first half was brutal to watch - the meltdown of Dunst's wedding was powerful (echoes of <i>Festen</i>, of course) and Dunst really impressed me in a way that I didn't think she was capable.  Then, as the focus shifts to Charlotte Gainsbourg, the sci-fi plot begins to emerge and things become drawn-out and difficult to enjoy.  I think <i>Melancholia</i> has some tremendous acting performances - pretty much everyone is exemplary, though I would have loved more Charlotte Rampling<i> - </i>but as a general fan of dystopian film, this failed to use the format to explore possibilities, which is what I like about the other end-of-world pictures.  Von Trier is much more introverted and localised, which could be a fascinating take, but instead it just felt irrelevant and unengaging.  Dunst's character is so human she feels like one of us, but she actualy seems to stabilise as the end approaches and thus distances the film ever further from my own engagement,  And insert my usual complaint about running time here.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 September 2011<br />Bridesmaids<br />Paul Feig, USA, 2011<br />Location: bed<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />Company: none<br />I need to get over the idea that a comedy feature film is going to be as satisfying as the best television comedy right now.  This offering from the Apatow studio distinguishes itself by having a female-orientated storyline, but maintaining a high (if uneven) level of raunchyness.  It's the coming-out party for Kristin Wiig, who is fantastic, but the rest of the characters are disturbingly underdeveloped, to the point of caricature.  You can tell they relied heavily on improvisation and cobbled it together in editing, and while there are some very very funny moments, there's also too many weak dramatic interludes.  Kudos to the writers for challenging the bromance perception of the Apatow industry, but this still suffered from the bloat of <i>Funny People</i>, etc.  Thankfully, the wedding sequence itself  was not dragged out, and Tim Heidecker was awesome to see as the groom.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 September 2011<br />11 Harrowhouse<br />Aram Avakian, UK, 1974<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I'm trying to put my life into a bit more routine than it's been for the past 2 years, so at the moment I'm starting each day with a few hours of work renovating the flat, followed by a 2 hour break during which I will watch a film and/or read.  This way I can actually start to see films again, and hopefully without feeling too guilty about neglecting other work (as it will come after a lot of exhausting physical labour and before I start coding, writing, or Ptarmigan business for the day).  Of course this may only survive for a few days but it was a still nice to watch some 70s cinema, as it's really been awhile!  <i>11 Harrowhouse</i> was a mess of a heist film, with a non-comedic Charles Grodin leading things with an icy reserve.  James Mason was fantastic here but the plot was farfetched and the whole film was layered with Grodin's narration, which was clearly an attempt to save face on the script.  There were some really wooden moments between the actors, and even Gielgud can only work with what he has.  The cockroach thing was a great conceit and this followed the whole <i>Rififi</i> style of heist film, which a long, captivating sequence free from dialogue that was by far the highlight of the film.  The chase scene at the end was near-unwatchable and Trevor Howard's "Well, you win some, you lose some" was pretty ludicrous. Everything was so sloppy and uneven here that I actually think I liked it because of the mess.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 October 2011<br />            Das Netz<br />Lutz Dammbeck, Germany, 2003<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I read about this in the Brian Holmes book and he made it sound far more interesting than it's description would indicate.  Which was true -- <i>Das Netz</i> is technically about cybernetics and the Unabomber, but really an exploration of various things - control, philosophy, and interpretations.  Stylistically, there's a debt to Adam Curtis but also some really horrible, illustrative choices - too many scenes of the filmmaker using the Internet, clicking on website links, and the like.  Plus, the parts where he writes in his notebook things like "art -&gt; technology -&gt; LSD" are such a desperate attempt to put something on-screen that might have served better as an audio documentary.  But lack of innovative images aside, <i>Das Netz</i> really opens up as it moves along.  At first I thought it was just going to be another documentary about 60s counterculture with the requisite Stewart Brand interview, etc. but it takes off in a lot of different directions.  The Unabomber theme, far from being played out, is the glue that holds it all together.  The correspondance between the Unabomber and the filmmaker is strangely compelling and I was actually a bit disappointed when the film suddenly ended.  It's a bit frustrating how the filmmaker isn't able to coax better discussion about the Unabomber out of his victims - their moral outrage and refusal to discuss Kacyznski's ideas really shut down the dialogue.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 November 2011<br />Fight Club<br />David Fincher, USA / Germany, 1999<br />Location: Ville's place<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: Ville<br />Ville said "hey, get some takeaway and come hang out and we'll watch <i>Fight Club</i>" and that sounded like a fun bit of, you know, just 'hanging out' which I never actually do anymore.  We chatted overtop this since both of us had seen it plenty of times but it's always good to watch again; I stopped at parts to just watch the most compelling scenes.  So much to love about this; I don't know if I had any new insights, but I thought amazingly about maybe reading the book, which is weird cause I've never even been slightly interested in it before.  For whatever reason I've decided I won't like Palahniuk but maybe he's actually great...<br /><br /><br /><br />2 November 2011<br />            White Lightning<br />Joseph Sargent, USA, 1973<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: Lewis<br />The first of the two Gator movies is pretty good I guess - a film that was so literally drenched it sweat that every character glistened throughout.  Burt was Burt and it's funny how much of a Southern film this tried to be, with the counterculture breathing around the main plot.  "Bogan" county is a funny name if you know Aussie slang and Ned Beatty was good to watch whenever he's on-screen; I liked that moonshine was the main economy down there.  Burt's Oscar speech about how his brother was killed and 'What does it mean?' almost made sense, but this was really a film about having car chases and showing Burt sans-shirt as much as possible.  I anxiously look forward to the sequel.<br /><br /><br /><br />22 November 2011<br />And Everything Is Going Fine<br />Steven Soderbergh, USA, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />A day off for once, where I can relax and watch a film!  I've been waiting some time to see this, as it had a pretty limited release and I actually forgot about it.  Since I'm a big Spalding Gray fan, this was essential and also pretty hard to watch.  I had no idea that so many of his early monologues existed in video form and it was a thrill to see them, yet also frustrating to only see excerpts.  Honestly, if <i>The Complete Monologues of Spading Gray</i> was available commercially I'd buy it instantly.  So this was the necessary final film, which Soderbergh constructed deftly from existing monologues and interview footage.  Probably 95% of the voices and words in this film come from Gray, and it's no wonder that it was assembled posthumously but still has the feel of something that he would have created himself.  Soderbergh tastefully avoids Gray's own suicide but of course the theme of suicide hangs over everything, just like it does in all of his work.  I ended up feeling melancholic and depressed after this, as I knew I would, but it was so awesome to see this anyway that I'm glad I did.  But this is really only for Gray completists I think.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 November 2011<br />W.R. - Misterije organizma<br />Dusan Makavejev, Yugoslavia / West Germany, 1971<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DVD rip on screen via projector<br />Company: Liminal Images attendees<br />I don't plan to screen feature films as part of 'Liminal Images' often, but since we have a week-long workshop based loosely on the theories of Wilhelm Reich, I thought it would be appropriate.  A ton of people came - enough to pack the space just to the point of uncomfortableness, but everyone seemed to dig the film (or at least, no one left).  It's been some time since I've seen this, and in some ways it was more straight than I remembered, but in some ways it was more crazy.  The first 30 minutes was pretty much a documentary about Reich which I had forgotten, and then the Yugoslavian madness starts and it starts to unravel.  It's hard to pin down exactly what Makavejev's argument is.  It's definiteyl against pornography and the commercialisation of sexuality, but then the section with Al Goldstein speaking sounds like an endorsement of <i>Screw</i>.  Of course it's juxtaposed against this Stalinist film from the 40s, which seems so overtly totalitarian.  Tuli Kupferberg is brilliant and his zany character is the perfect link between state-orchestrated violence and sexuality.  But what does it all say of Communism?  The lead actress, who meets her unfortunate fate, is simultaneously an advocate and critic of communism. Of course, this is the only realistic take, especialy as this is coming from an Eastern bloc country in 1971, -- but it's hard to tell if her pleas for sexual liberation are meant to be tongue in cheek.  Certainly, when she meets the Russian skater, there is the only actual moment of romance in the film -- Comrade Ljuba the Cock and her roommate are merely fucktoys, and there's no emotional intimacy, no kissing, nothing but thrusting and grunting.  I don't know if this it the prurience that Reich was so against, or if this was meant to be free of it.  The way the different strands of this films are worked together is even more multifeathered than <i>Sweet Movie</i> (which is basically just two narratives).  The bits of the film appear to comment on each other deliberately as they go on, and it's occasionally stunning in its technique.  So I'm really impressed by this formally more than anything - the zany, challenging content is source material made more multifaceted through the editing and voiceovers.  Not to mention the music, which always has some element of commentary, whether it's the Fugs 'Kill for Peace' or a Serbian-sounding folk song, or a workers chant - it's actually almost sensory overload, yet open to subjective readings in the way that the best works of art are.<br /><br /><br /><br />1 December 2011<br />Sweet Movie<br />Dusan Makavejev, Canada / France / West Germany, 1974<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DVD on screen via projector<br />Company: Scott Andrew Elliott, Sari<br /><i>Sweet Movie</i> feels like a natural complement to <i>WR</i>, which we screened at Ptarmigan the previous night.  This is something I have seen quite a few times, but neither Scott nor Sari had seen it.  It was fun watching it with them as they had a great reaction - amusement and energy, and lots of laughter.  As a performance artist, Sari thought this should be essential viewing in performance study programmes, and I agree.  I think this is a better film than <i>WR</i> and actually probably better than most films, period.  It's a bit more coherent but despite the twin-helix structure of the two main narratives, Makavejev still throws in some insane montages.  The footage of Stalin's mass graves being dug up, when slammed against the sex scenes, is a gut-punch unlike any other.  But as easy as it is to see <i>Sweet Movie</i> as conflating sex with death, it's not that simple.  Potemkin's murder is simultaneously enjoyed by both him and his killer, and the way the children rise up in the final shot suggests that death is merely a plot device here - a stand-in for freedom, which is really the subject of both this and <i>WR</i>.  As a look to a third way between socialism and capitalism, this is actually fairly nuanced - the renunciation of both straight philosophies is clear enough in the ridiculousness of the scenes, and Marx's tear is a giveaway where Makavejev's true sympathies lie.  Plus, I really love the music which I've gotten to know well from so many viewing.  Is there life after birth?<br /><br /><br /><br />6 December 2011<br />Super 8<br />J.J. Abrams, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: Laura<br />Abrams' film is a perfect amalgamation of the classics of my generation, which I guess are also his generation: <i>The Goonies</i>, <i>Close Encounters</i>, etc.  Which is no great insight of mine.  That Spielberg is a producer on this is also no shock, and I wonder how much of a hand he had in shaping <i>Super 8</i>, which I must admit, is a 4-star entry into that genre.  I daresay <i>Super 8</i> is even better than its antecedents, as it seems to be made with contemporary sophistication and avoids awkward racial stereotypes and now-politically-incorrect dialogue that may plague the films of the early 1980s.  Setting this film in that time period, and building it around the (somewhat manipulative, but OK) Hollywood-tinged nostalgia and glorification of "movie magic" is a smart movie all the way.  Action sequences and special effects are calculated perfectly and at times were actually sort of suprising, though maybe that was due to Laura's more animated watching style.<br /><br /><br /><br />18 December 2011<br />            50/50<br />Jonathan Levine, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><i>50/50</i> was actually pretty good, a lot more serious than I expected.  Is this the best film Seth Rogen has ever been in, meaning an 'actually good film' as opposed to a bromance/grossout?  The acting power of Gordon-Levitt, Huston, and Philip Baker Hall makes this a winner, though the ending was predictable and formulaic.  Why not just end it with him being wheeled into the operating room and leave the rest up to the viewer?  The film is called <i>50/50</i>, after all.  But yeah, I enjoyed this - no gross-out humour which I expected from the clip shown on the Daily Show about Rogen shaving his balls - instead this being much more serious in tone, and quite dark at times (but not dark enough).<br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2011<br />            30 Minutes or Less<br />Ruben Fleischer, Germany / Canada / USA, 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />Company: none<br />I should watch movies in my studio more - I can sit on the windowsill and it's actually really cozy, and my external monitor is about the same size as the TV in the office.  <i>30 Minutes or Less</i> was actually really, really funny.  The difficult thing is that this film pokes fun at a really tragic true story, though nothing actually in the film does that - its only from knowing external criticism.  As a comedy, it's a cut above the usual misogynist shit that studios churn out, and Eisenberg's a good enough actor to make this less one-dimensional.  It's not a masterpiece in the slightest, but McBride and Swardson are a pretty good tweedledee and tweedeldum - I'd say this is McBride's funniest performance apart from the first season of <i>Eastbound and Down</i>.  I would even possibly watch this again.<br /><br /><br /><br />20 December 2011<br />            Attack the Block<br />Joe Cornish, UK, 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on computer<br />Company: none<br />This was exhilarating, brilliantly constructed, and as fun as cinema can be. I think it portrayed a Brixton council estate as realiastically as possible given that this is an alien invasion film; the violence and gore was at just the right level, and the action sequences were gripping.  No complaints at all about <i>Attack the Block</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2011<br />A Christmas Story<br />Bob Clark, USA / Canada, 1983<br />Location: Laura's<br />Format: DivX on TV via laptop<br />Company: Laura<br />Watched this over dinner as Laura had somehow never seen it.  I enjoyed it as much as always, though the best scene is probably the santa/dept. store scene, which I missed cause I was cleaning up in the kitchen.  Donald Fagen wrote a great piece for Slate about listening to Jean Shepherd monologues on the radio when he was young, so I was really focusing on Shepherd's narration this time, even though I've heard it so many times before, and it struck me as a bit hokey and over-the-top, though not without it's charms.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 December 2011<br />            Terri<br />Azazel Jacobs, USA, 2011<br />Location: Laura's<br />Format: DivX on TV via laptop<br />Company: Laura<br /><i>Terri</i> had a curious tone - the stark, unadorned DV gave it a look that emphasised its gutpunching misery, unlike the poster which suggested a hazed-over fantasy.  I'm a vocal fan of John C. Reilly and this might be his best performance yet, in a character which amalgamates a lot of his other roles and overall comes off as extremely genuine and altruistic.  I don't generally enjoy films about dark misfits, at least in that torturous <i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i> way (though I did enjoy that film when I saw it 15 years ago), but <i>Terri</i> was excellent.  I also was in the small minority that enjoyed <i>Cyrus</i> but this was totally different, as it was truly about Terri and John C. Reilly's character was less active in the narrative.  Creepy high school situations are easy to construct but the kid who played Chad took it to a new level.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 December 2011<br />            Moneyball<br />Bennett Miller, USA, 2011<br />Location: Tallink ferry "Star" and Ptarmigan studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br />It takes a flashy screenwriter like Aaron Sorkin to make sabermetrics and the <i>Moneyball</i> book into compelling filmmaking, but they succeeded -- and finally, a baseball movie I can enjoy because there's hardly any baseball in it.  I thought this was more of Jonah Hill's picture from what I had read in advance but this was a Pitt star vehicle all the way.  The ending dragged on a bit, and I could have done without the mushy father/daughter stuff (I didn't need to humanize Beane at all, I was happy with him as a machine-like baseball GM only), but overall, thumbs-up to <i>Moneyball</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 December 2011<br />The Third Man<br />Carol Reed, UK, 1949<br />Location: MoKS basement, Mooste, Estonia<br />Format: DivX projected on 'screen'<br />Company: MoKs No Years party people<br />Somehow it became suggested that we watch <i>The Third Man</i> tonight, the alternate choice being <i>Dogtooth</i>, and we went for it.  I decided to lie on the floor and fall asleep since I had seen it before, but I ended up watching the whole thing awake because I was enjoying it so much.  Being at a low vantage point, I tended to enjoy the weird camera angles and shadows/darkness in the cinematography instead of listening to the dialogue so much.  I think I actually really enjoy Joseph Cotten because he's just so douchey at ever point in this, yet still the proganost of sorts.  I was talking about this with Danny before we watched it, cause it's his favourite film, and I got excited about a few scenes in advance - the one where Cotten is giving the ill-advised talk to the literature society and they ask him who is favourite writer is, and he says Zane Grey -- and of course, Orson Welles' entrance into the film with the light hitting his face.  Is there a better entrance scene in the history of cinema?  I also forgot how far into the movie Welles' appearance actually comes - almost an hour, I think, and then he's barely actually in it except for the awesome ferris wheel scene and the ending.  Anyway, there's a reason this is considered one of the greatest films in the history of cinema (and generally regarded as the finest British-made film ever).  It's fucking awesome from start to finish.  The soundtrack, I remember being very fond of because I like zithers, but this time I found it to be really loud and obnoxious and too repetitive - in my memory it was really spooky and distant.  It's actually a weird choice, the way it is, though I can't really imagine this film differently.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 January 2012<br />            A Good Old Fashioned Orgy<br />Alex Gregory, Peter Huyck, USA, 2011<br />Location: Laura's<br />Format: DivX on TV via laptop<br />Company: Laura<br />This was not good.  But not horrible.  Which is even worse.  I laughed mildly ever 7-10 minutes, which was enough to keep me from turning it off.  The humour wasn't as misogynistic as I expected, but still pretty bland.  I think I might hate Sudekis, or at least the male character he portrays in this and <i>Hall Pass</i> (which was much much worse).  Even Martin Starr couldn't do much with the shitty character they wrote for him.  At least the ending actually was an orgy and not some shitty copout that reinforces traditional sexual values.  Not that this was particularly progressive - we got a lesbian interlude but the two guys kissing were met with the most blatant homophobia, as opposed to inverting the bromance like it could have.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 January 2012<br />            The Bride Wore Black<br />Fran&#xE7;ois Truffaut, France / Italy, 1968<br />Location: Laura's<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: Laura<br />I've seen very little Truffaut, and this is not the film to start rectifying that situation with.  <i>The Bride Wore Black</i> was somewhat of an inspiration for <i>Kill Bill</i>, not that I think much of those films, and done in a very methodical, unfolding way that slowly lets more and more backstory in over it's duration.  I stayed on the verge of entertained but ultimately was left a bit empty.  I suspect the best way to read this film is as a feminist battlecry, as the bride's victims are generally shown to be sleazy womanisers.  But then, since her ultimate dedication is to her (dead) husband, maybe this just reinforces traditional roles of servility, submission, etc.  Just because she's killing dudes doesn't make her into Valerie Solanis.  I did enjoy the 7" record she played whenever killing; a good tune, for sure.  Also odd was how the deaths became progressively less graphic, beginning with the first dude's fall from a balcony and the final two actually occuring off-screen.  Not completely sure if that was intentional or just me trying to read more into this.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 January 2012<br />            Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus<br />Steven Shainberg, USA, 2006<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />Since I started reading Sontag's <i>On Photography</i> I thought it might be time to see this oddball Diane Arbus semi-biopic, which I had been curious about a few years ago.  This was of course an extemely fictionalised account as the title indicates, and not even a biopic as it only imagines a brief period in her life.  But I liked this, quite a lot actually, despite some very, um, cinematic musical montages and the horrible scene at the ocean.  Kidman was spot-on and the film overall oozed with fetishes, not just among the people in it but in it's treatment of objects and surfaces.  The now-standard trick of creating a disorientating interior space through strange angles and non-continuous spatial elements (like in <i>Suspiria</i>) is employed here, as their flats start to become the stars of the film, which makes the revelation of Arbus's architectural photography almost like a callback.  Downey Jr. is pretty good but the guy who plays Allan Arbus is really great.  Allan Arbus is the star of <i>Greaser's Palace</i> too!  This was directed by the same guy who made <i>Secretary</i>, a guy who really is intruiging for his ability to lay his issues out into mainstream cinema with big-time movie stars to flesh them out.  No pun intended there.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2012<br />Win Win<br />Thomas McCarthy, USA, 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />My new film-watching system is pretty good - sitting parallel to my heater under Julia's sleeping bag, in my office chair with feet up on another chair.  I woke up today and felt lazy and decided to watch <i>Win Win</i>, which was certainly an enjoyabe way to pass the time.  There were a lot of film clichés in the plot - the good family man who can't make ends meet and makes a bad ethical choice which comes back to haunt him, etc.  Paul Giamatti does the same thing he always does, but it was a mostly strong script, and the kid who played the teenager was brilliant in his minimalism. Giamatti's sidekick was the attempt at comic relief, but I mostly found him to be irritating, like a third-rate John Stamos wannabe. Compared to <i>The Visitor</i>, this was a lot more gentle and obvious, and that was a pretty easygoing film too; I somehow enjoyed this more while thinking it was not as good. I guess my main criticism was how 'safe' this is, and when the best scenes in a film are those of high-school wrestling, it's probably a bad sign. Credit to McCarthy though for putting this together nicely and I'm sure he'll be rewarded with awards galore.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2012<br />Monkey Business<br />Norman Z. McLeod, USA, 1931<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />Just felt like re-watching this for some reason; forgot how much fun these films can be. There's so little plot to hang these shenanigans around that it's really wonderful and liberating. Zeppo is such total dead weight though. I'm still fascinated by the inherent perversity in Harpo, and he gets pretty shady here by just blatatly chasing women around with a demented grin. The scene where he was sitting on top of the woman in the chair was particularly amazing.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 January 2012<br />Source Code<br />Duncan Jones, USA / France, 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />Lewis was raving about this so I thought I'd check it out.  <i>Source Code</i> is a shitty film, the type of bullshit sci-fi that can be really fun, and this certainly was a great shitty film. I'm prediposed to like time-travel movies even though this took pains to say that it wasn't actually time-travel. The "science" was just thin enough to my liking, and Jake Gyllenhal did what he could with the dialogue. The black scientist was a great caricature and I was laughing every time he was on-screen. But <i>Source Code</i> delivers and knows exactly how to pack it's punches; it's essentially a cross between <i>Groundhog Day</i> and <i>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</i>, but those are both amazing films so I don't mind the synthesis. A nice nightcap to a three-film day; I haven't had downtime like this in ages.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 February 2012<br />            Tim and Eric&#x27;s Billion Dollar Movie<br />Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, USA, 2012<br />Location: bed<br />Format: DivX streamed via iPad<br />Company: none<br />As crazy as the trailer was, I actually had low expectations for this. When beloved TV spins into cinema, especially sketch-based work, it's always disappointing. I include everything from the Twin Peaks film to the shitty Mr. Show movie, and the Arrested Development film that I know is going to disappoint (how can it not, after all those expectations?).  Kids in the Hall <i>Brain Candy</i> is maybe the one exception. I mean, it's just not feasible to expect to compete with a product that has a shorter run-time. An average episode of <i>30 Rock</i> is funnier than the vast majority of comedy films, even the ones I like. <i>Awesome Show</i> was only 11 minutes long and usually packed more punch than even a 22-minute sitcom. Anyway, I had thus lowered my own expectations, and then was surprised to find <i>Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie </i>to be pretty great. They held to a much tighter focus than I expected, and it was really plot-driven, but setting it in Eastland Mall was a beautiful touch and there was the perfect amount of references to old <i>Awesome Show</i> stuff without being too many to scare away non-obsessives. Utter stupidity everywhere, but just enough genius that I will watch this again. Ferrell, Forte and Reilly were great but Ray Wise/Grill Vogel completely stole the show.This actually feels like a new era for them, and while it won't ever be as insane as the greatest moments in the Richard Dunn era, I definitely enjoyed this.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 February 2012<br />Horse Feathers<br />Norman Z. McLeod, USA, 1932<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: Patrick, Lewis<br /><i>Horse Feathers </i>is as close to perfect as the Marx brothers get, I think. I enjoyed watching this again - I picked it cause I've been in a Marxist mood (ha!) and because of the football connection. My Mom called so I missed the part where they go to the speakeasy and Harpo has the swordfish, but I saw the rest. The football game is so great because they cram every imaginable football-related joke (for the time) into that scene. The anarchy is constant and the very last scene, where Zeppo is out of the picture and the other 3 all marry the daughter, is such a complete non-sequitur that it reminds me of the great 'Hey everybody, we're all gonna get laid!' from <i>Caddyshack</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />26 February 2012<br />            Passenger Side<br />Matt Bissonnette, Canada, 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />Saw Agent Wichmann had watched this and Adam Scott piques my interest, though to be honest, I tired of him here since in this weak, uneven indie film he just throws up a wall of dickishness for 90 minutes. Maybe that's an easy acting trick, because when you act like a dick for most of the film, then the few moments of humanity that shine through have a greater impact and make him seem far more complex. But I enjoyed watching this anyway; Bissonette was pretty great, and the soundtrack was amazing since it seemed to have been culled directly from my own record collection. (Seriously, two cuts each from Mekons <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> and the third Camper Van Beethoven album?) The plot actually was predictable but I did like the aesthetic (tape deck!) and would recommend this to people of my exact demographic.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 February 2012<br />Tiny Furniture<br />Lena Dunham, USA, 2010<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />I wanted to see this for ages but had trouble finding a torrent. When I finally found it, I wasn't that interested, but I watched it anyway while scanning a textbook, which is tedious and dull. I had a lot of problems with <i>Tiny Furniture</i>, the main being my general problem enjoying movies that draw sympathy from unsympathetic characters, in this case the privileged, aimless daughter of a sucessful NYC artist. (Wes Anderson films are the exception for me, I'd say, though it's really because there's so much more to his film, and this was rather pedestrian). Dunham is not very likeable to watch, which was very much the point, and I guess it's impressive as a writer/director effort, but the shallow trappings of early 20's NYC kids are portrayed with a smirk, but not enough of one as I would like. This is no <i>Portlandia</i>; Dunham's attempting to portray these parties and interactions in a way that is not judgemental, but also aware of the youthful follies. Maybe I feel that she didn't commit enough to a viewpoint, instead drawing us into the mundane 'problems' of her character. Or maybe it's just that I'm 31 and have lived outside of the US for so long now that I just feel completely distant from this world. I never really knew this anyway. To me, this was a whiny film that made me feel older and more detached than I thought possible. And my god, the clothing of this time period is so dreadful, but I couldn't tell if that was supposed to be intentional or not. I think I'm happy in Estonia getting slowly old and having no interaction with this world. Having said that (a phrase I can't use without thinking of Larry David now), I laughed a few times and think maybe by the end, this won me over. I'll definitely check out the next thing she does, but I won't rush to see it.<br /><br /><br /><br />12 March 2012<br />            Le dossier 51<br />Michel Deville, France / West Germany, 1978<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />I'm pretty impressed with <i>Le dossier 51</i>, which seems to be a conspiracy/spy movie turned inside out, but eventually unfolds into being so much more. This is an investigation of identity and privacy, and the way it's filmed is fairly innovative (being entirely point-of-view shots) so it's really not like anything I'd ever seen. The espionage aspect is enjoyable enough, but the best parts are the rare personal intrusions - 51's mother's breakdown, and the part with the woman from <i>Sweet Movie</i>. The plot itself becomes incredibly compelling despite being all periphery, and the ending might qualify as a twist - or at least a cynical, brutal indictment of institutions and society.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 March 2012<br />            Young Adult<br />Jason Reitman, USA, 2011<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on Macbook (external monitor)<br />Company: none<br />"The 90s were great". Reitman's films have a certain candy-like quality about them, but I'm not 100% sure about this one. Patton Oswalt is so fucking amazing, but the story left me a bit cold; I'm less intrigued by stories of people who can't get over their adolescence now than I used to be. Maybe this is all a bit like a second-rate <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, but with a completely unlikeable protagonist and a great, nostalgic soundtrack. Or maybe this just made me recognise my own mortality; I can imagine myself emptily searching, driving around midwestern America listening to Teenage Fanclub, and trying to hang on to something if I wasn't lucky enough to have built my life around obscure subcultures, etc. But yeah, I did enjoy parts of <i>Young Adult</i>, and overall would give it a thumns-up only if I view the too-snappy ending as meant to be a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek bit of false closure. I suspect I'm wrong, though - something felt so uneven and sloppy here, for with all of Reitman's intelligence and talent, could they really rely on a device as vapid as the young adult novel being written throughout to comment on the film? It seemed to logically folow through to the moment-of-reevaluation, epiphany ending, that actually undercuts the darkness. Of course, vapid is the point, and I guess kudos to Theron for pulling out such a miserable performance, but everything here was a bit too easy. All the characters are so extremely formulaic, and the depiction of small-town life just seemed too easy; for a film that's supposed to be a character study it could have been a bit more complex. I'm nitpicking here, but after Reitman's <i>Up in the Air</i>, which was a dark and brutal character study masquearding as a pleasant comedy, I expected more.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 March 2012<br />            Tower Heist<br />Brett Ratner, USA, 2011<br />Location: my studio (falling asleep)<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />Company: none<br />Maybe watching on an iPad doesn't do justice to the cinematographic majesty of <i>Tower Heist</i>. Or maybe this was just a formulaic heist-comedy, which at least was well-done for what it was. Eddie Murphy's much-heralded comeback was hardly that - he had a pretty small role in the film, i think. But though you could have just put JB Smoov in here for a lot less money, Murphy was undoubtedly the highlight. Alan Alda's evil Madoff clone wasn't exactly a nuanced look at white-collar crime, but at least they made him the baddie. Though Matthrew Broderick's character was from the same world, yet a hero. Casey Affleck does a good Alan Arkin impersonation, and I outwardly laughed at a few of the comedic bits. Overall, this wasn't comedy enough for me, nor was it heist-y enough, and the title of the film was really lame - sounds like a working title they forgot to change. The stunts and plot points probably don't hold up to close scrutiny either, but this was mindless entertainment I put in so I could fall asleep, and I guess it served that role well.<br /><br /><br /><br />24 March 2012<br />            High Road<br />Matt Walsh, USA, 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />Company: none<br />I figured <i>High Road</i> would be a shitty stoner comedy but it strove to be something slightly better and I guess succeeded. It was built around long improvisations and thus reflects the strength of the comedic talents. A few scenes had me in stitches, though I was bored throughout most of it. The presence of Rich Fulcher certainly brightened up the film, and the kid who plays Badger on Breaking Bad was pretty amazing too. Rob Riggle just yelled a lot though, which was pretty dull.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 April 2012<br />            The Temptation of St. Tony<br />Veiko &#xD5;unpuu, Estonia / Finland / Sweden, 2009<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DVD on TV<br />Company: none<br />I borrowed this DVD from Ville over a year ago and forgot to watch it; he was bugging me to get it back so I finally sat down and watched Veiko's followup to <i>Sügisball</i>, which I found to be vastly superior in every way. <i>Püha Tõnu kiusamine </i>is a really difficult film because it switches tones so much, but adheres to a central character which I think is where <i>Sügisball</i> would have been better. The urban blight has already been replaced by barren countryside and small, run-down Estonian houses - the real, non-Tallinn Estonia that I have almost no interaction with these days. When this film wants to be dry, Kaurismäki-styled dark comedy, it's funny; when it wants to be Bergman-esque and dramatic it is;  when it wants to be macabre, horrifying David Lynch-style surrealist nightmares, it does that too. I enjoyed the changes of pace for the most part, and I don't mean these comparisons to other filmmakers to make it sound like Veiko doesn't have his own voice. This is a filmic exploration of psychology, identity, and emotion that deserves more than being labeled mere surrealism, though of course that antecedent is all over this. The crisp, b&amp;w cinematography really worked well here - it lent a gravitas to the more ridiculous moments, such as the police interrogation scene.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 April 2012<br />            The Sitter<br />David Gordon Green, USA, 2011<br />Location: M/S Superstar, en route from Helsinki to Tallinn<br />Format: DivX on Macbook<br />Company: none<br />It's never a great sign when the best thing you can say about a film is 'Not as good as <i>Your Highness</i>'. Actually, <i>The Sitter</i> was entertaining enough as something to watch on a ferry while really tired. This semi-remake of <i>Adventures in Babysitting </i>worked when Sam Rockwell and JB Smoove were being ridiculous. Green balanced the silly parts with the plot enough that I didn't feel that it was weighed down by story, though the story was pretty stupid. But this is what it was, and it made 90 minutes go by when I was too sleepy to read anything intelligent.<br /><br /><br /><br />5 May 2012<br />            Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy<br />Tomas Alfredson, France / UK / Germany, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />So nice to watch a film after a mad (but wonderful) week of people - to lie on the couch-bed and just lose myself in a great spy film. The aesthetics of this were spot-on, really having the feel of films like 'The Spy Who Came In From the Cold' though with beautiful, modern retro palettes. Some impressive cutaway/<i>Tout va bien-</i>style shots too. I never read the book or saw the Alec Guiness BBC series so I was actually in suspense here, and as understated at this is, it's thrilling too. It takes awhile to get into the plot, which is not made clear or obvious, and mixes great flashbacks in an intentionally disorientating way. Oldman (why do I always want to call him Gary Oldham?) is deserving of his acclaim, as the performance is simultaneously complex and stoic. The only criticisms I could possibly draw out of this are that the Britishisms seem exaggerated, such as the ministers having cups of tea and sandwiches during these intense meetings -- but how do I know what it was like then?<br /><br /><br /><br />5 May 2012<br />            American History X<br />Tony Kaye, USA, 1998<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I never saw this before but recently read a fascinating article about Tony Kaye, who is apparently a psychotic asshole and was essentially blacklisted from Hollywood before returning recently with a new Adrian Brody film that I want to watch. But I never saw this, which made his name, so I gave it a go and found a pretty uneven but intense, compelling film. Norton is fantastic and I always wondered what happened to Furlong after <i>Terminator 2</i>. There were really hackneyed scenes, particularly in the dialogue, and the denoument was somewhat ridiculous, but at least left some questions unanswered. Overall I enjoyed it, and admit that some of the tension was undeniably compelling.<br /><br /><br /><br />6 May 2012<br />            Detachment<br />Tony Kaye, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This much-ballyhooed film kept me enraptured for it's entire running time, mostly due to the awesomeness of Adrian Brody. However, <i>Detachment</i> was, well, complicated. Some of it was brilliant, and the visual style was perfect - developing from all the closeups in <i>American History X</i> but with an almost psychedelic colour palette and the right amout of intruding animations and Nic Roegisms. But holy shit, this film was so over-the-top, saturated in such melodramatic misery that it resembled a Jehovah's Witness propaganda film. At times I felt like i was watching a late-era Smashing Pumpkins video, and while I liked the stylisation of this film, it added to that effect, as it technically resembled a music video. I want to recommend that Tony Kaye learn a few things about subtlety, but as I thought about those words, I realised that there are vast amount of subtelty in this film. It's just that the broad structures of plot/narrative don't have any, painted in extremely bleak and broad strokes, which puts the final product in a weird middle space. I'd still recommend this, and it was a far better film than <i>American History X</i>, thanks mostly to a better script and a stronger supporting cast. It feels almost like the plot was dictated by a teenage goth, and then the rest filled in by an accomplished scriptwriter. Maybe this weird imbalance is actually what I'll appreciate about this film in retrospect, or maybe I'll eventually be embarassed that I even enjoyed it this much. Also, James Caan was awesome.<br /><br /><br /><br />14 May 2012<br />            God Bless America<br />Bobcat Goldthwait, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I'm a fan of Goldthwait's films so I looked forward to this satire, which is an uneven mixture of <i>Network</i>, <i>Natural Born Killers</i> and <i>Series 7: The Contenders</i>. I had fun watching this, though I think I cut Goldthwait a lot of slack that I wouldn't give to any other filmmaker. I'm very particular about violence in films, and this avoided some thorny moral questions because it was so satirical --  really little more than a front end for Goldthwait's misanthropic rants. Freddy Rumsen from <i>Mad Men</i> is pretty fantastic though, and though its ethics are skewed, it was a million times more redeemable than shit like <i>Super.</i> There's a real release in watching Bill O'Reilly and reality TV stars get gunned down, even if I don't actually want to see that happen in real life. The newspaper headlines put into the film suggest the ironic backfiring of their killing spree and I'm glad that's in there, though it again suggests a debate that <i>God Bless America</i> isn't actually willing to commit to. Visually, this was a sigifnicant improvement over his other films, with a great colour palette and some better camera work, though the film itself was overall much weaker than the last two. His films really work from ridiculous premises and then try to unravel themselves over the 90 minutes, so there's something strangely anti-climatic about them, yet satisfying at the same time. I would have probably loved this in high school, though it will date quickly. Part of me wanted it to go more in the miserable direction it began, a la <i>A Serious Man</i>, but I was entertained enough throughout to enjoy this for what it was.<br /><br /><br /><br />29 May 2012<br />Little Murders<br />Alan Arkin, USA, 1971<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: Gesa<br />Watching my favourite film ever with my new favourite person. This was triggered by it getting mentioned on <i>Mad Men</i> last week; could it be that the leering guy in Megan's audition was actually supposed to be Jules Feiffer? Not much to say after this many iterations through except that I continue to love this and feel that it's totally complete as a statement. That Gesa seemed to agree was a good sign.<br /><br /><br /><br />30 May 2012<br />            Chronicle<br />Josh Trank, UK / USA, 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Low expectations for this one that were far, far exceeded. Trank's teenage sci-fi film does a lot with a relatively low budget, and was everything <i>Super 8</i> should have been (though I did enjoy that film). At times the filming/video device got a bit tiresome, but the first hour of the film was so exhilarating that I didn't mind. The scenes of the three teenagers bonding are so genuinely heartwarming that the eventual turn actually has some impact, and though the finality of it all delivers the payoff that such films demand, I loved it too. Can't wait to see what this guy does next.<br /><br /><br /><br />4 June 2012<br />Magicians<br />Andrew O'Connor, UK, 2007<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: Lewis, Andreas<br />After a long day of "co-working" and doing various practical things, we somehow ended up talking about British comedy and the masterful writing of Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong. A quick IMDB credit revealed that they wrote a film starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb, which strangely none of us had ever heard of. A download later and we watched it, and it was a fun late-night diversion. <i>Magicians</i> is actually really funny - it's a fairly rote script, simliar to <i>The Prestige</i> in plot only a comedy, and despite the broad and exaggerated characters, I had a great time watching this. To some extent it might be due to the effect of watching it late with friends and laughing together, creating synergy, etc. But actually I think <i>Magicians</i> has some truly great moments, and Mitchell and Webb are closer to their <i>Peep Show</i> funny levels instead of their <i>Mitchell and Webb Look</i> style. Lots of great bit roles by British comedy up-and-comers, such as the guy who plays Julius Nicholson on <i>The Thick of It</i>. Also, Peter Capaldi! Even when Capaldi completely phones it in, as he does in this film, he's still totally fucking excellent.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 June 2012<br />            Shampoo<br />Hal Ashby, USA, 1975<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />I never saw this through to the end before, and the final scene of this is so great that I don't know how I could have stopped earlier. <i>Shampoo</i> is such classic 70's filmwork that it almost seems beyond commentary, though I wouldn't put it among my 'essentials' (I prefer Robert Towne and Ashby together in <i>The Last Detail</i>). Beatty is basically playing himself, and since Julie Christie is in it, their relationship is totally sold, beautifully, and imparts an emotional weight without a whole lot of screen time to develop it. I actually thought Jack Warden was pretty enjoyable in this, particularly the scene near the end with he and Beatty have their big talk. I wouldn't say this is as masterful as <i>Petulia</i> in addressing America's changing sexual attitudes, but it's great. Situating it in 1968, a period piece by only 7 years, allows Ashby to wedge in his political statements which are slightly unnecessary. This isn't really a film about the counterculture, Beatty even saying 'I'm not anti-establishment!' though the party scene certainly hammers on that. His sex-addicted hedonism is more of a catalyst for such behaviour, and if there's any indictment it's for establishment people who do whatever they want, regardless of whom it will hurt. Everyone manages to hurt everyone in this film, and that's why it's good. I could see a modern day Brad Pitt in Beatty's role.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 June 2012<br />            Mother, Jugs &#x26; Speed<br />Peter Yates, USA, 1976<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />A problematic film, in many ways, or maybe it's just an attempt to recreate <i>M*A*S*H</i> with ambulance drivers instead of army medics. Except, and this is the crucial difference - there's nothing really to protest here. Altman's film was an attack on the Vietnam war, but <i>Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed</i> is, what, a cry against privatisation of ambulance services? Bill Cosby, Allen Garfield and Harvey Keitel provided enough entertainment that I enjoyed this, mostly, though it's comedy/drama juxtapositions were clumsy and the characters were pretty unengaging. Welch's character was subject to such abuse (even working its way into the title of the film) that I just got irritated, though Larry Hagman was deliciously creepy. In many ways this is a quintessential 70's film even if it's not very good. It would be good to make a case for Allen Garfield as the most important actor of the 1970s, though.<br /><br /><br /><br />13 June 2012<br />            The King of Marvin Gardens<br />Bob Rafelson, USA, 1972<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Stunning. This is a remarkable film that subverts almost everything I expected from it. Jack Nicholson portrayed a withdrawn, beta male, and Bruce Dern took the role you would expect Nicholson to be. Both performances were amazing; I loved Nicholson as a Joe Frank type, and Dern looked a lot like Borat. Ellen Burstyn's insanity was haunting, yet compelling; the film played with themes of sexual openness, but almost as an afterthought, unlike <i>Shampoo</i> beating you over the head with it. I've never seen <i>Five Easy Pieces</i> (though I should) so I'm not super familiar with Rafelson beyond <i>Easy Rider </i>and <i>Head</i>, but I really need to dig deeper. This was really low-key, almost daring the viewer to demand something more, but then these crazy surreal scenes were juxtaposed - like the beauty pageant - as if it's nothing. There were a few compositions that were absolutely wonderful (thanks to that Hungarian cinematographer, no doubt) like the marching band on the boardwalk, and when the mannequins are staring in at Nicholson and the thug. There's an interesting racial distiction here between Carruther's gang and the protagonists, but it's just enough to be intriguing without being exploitative.<br /><br /><br /><br />25 June 2012<br />The Puffy Chair<br />Jay Duplass, USA, 2005<br />Location: my studio<br />Format: DivX on iPad<br />Company: none<br />I watched this in bed on the iPad, which probably would make David Lynch mad but it seemed appropriate for the amateur way in which this was filmed and recorded. I really enjoyed this film, though, even though it hardly seems like one to base a movement around. The small town Virginia setting was pretty close to where I spent my own 2005 and Mark Duplass's doughy version of John Krasinski was pretty funny. As a drinking game you could have a drink every time someone says 'dude'. His emotionally stunted too-serious yet goofball act was really balanced well by the bearded brother, who feels like someone that would have been hanging around the Pittsburgh music scene at the time. I should watch all the others from this film movement just for fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />28 June 2012<br />            21 Jump Street<br />Phil Lord, Chris Miller, USA, 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan black room<br />Format: DivX on wall via projector<br />Company: none<br />Very enjoyable! This managed to be funny without being mean, too violent, or too misogynistic, but still had a little edge. It didn't take itself even remotely seriously which is what was key; Nick Offerman's brief scene completely laid out the irony and the cameos by the original dudes at the end made it. This wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but Jonah Hill was awesome enough throughout, Korean Jesus was actually funny, and despite the plot holes and overall stupidity of the narrative, it delivered what I wanted on an escapist early evening movie trip.<br /><br /><br /><br />2 July 2012<br />            Jeff, Who Lives at Home<br />Jay Duplass, Mark Duplass, USA, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />There was a lot to like about <i>Jeff, Who Lives At Home</i> though I'm overall somewhat down on it. Segel (as a Mark Duplass stand-in) and Ed Helms had great comic moments - I actually thought Segel outshone Helms, which surprised me as I've never really cared for him before. But the film's focus on the problems of 'normal' people felt somewhat one-dimensional - we weren't give a lot of time to flesh out Jeff's belief system, and Helms actually got the most screen time though his character was basically the classic douchey, insensitive guy. The Duplasses clearly thought they could substitute closeups of Segel &amp; Helms overdoing it with their eyes -- facial expressions loaded with 'this is acting!' gravitas -- for actual writing. Sarandon brough some real sympathy to her subplot but the film's denoument seemed to be striving for the big <i>Magnolia</i>-type moments - the sprinklers, and the <i>deus ex machina</i> that got everyone to the bridge. Still, I liked it; it was genuinely funny and I really didn't know where it was going; it just reached a bit too far out of the comedy genre into the 'arthouse' area. Maybe I'm too harsh on films that walk the line of ambition, because it's certainly not something that bothers me about more overtly arty work. Still, i did like this and look forward to further work by these gents.<br /><br /><br /><br />8 July 2012<br />            The Extra Man<br />Shari Springer Berman, Robert Pulcini, USA / France, 2010<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />Jonathan Ames is a problematic writer for me. I came to enjoy <i>Bored to Death</i> despite thinking it was extremely, extremely flawed. This feature-length film mines very similar territory - the unlikely literary-obsessed protagonist, stuck in the world of Fitzgerald and the 1920, always clad in a blazer and tie; the cross-generation band of misfit friends; the half-assed explorations of vice and fetish. <i>The Extra Man</i> is built around Kevin Kline's ridiculous and insane character, who actually is compelling enough to hold the film together, though I think I stuck with this out of <i>Bored to Death </i>nostalgia. Dano's acting style is suitable for this fish-out-of-water high society setting - far moreso than Jason Schwartzmann's hipster flavourings - and the juxtaposition of Dano against contemporary Brooklyn lifestyles was clumsy and overly simplified. John C. Reilly is the star of this - his first line of dialogue is stunning and his singing scene is the film's one truly great moment; unfortunately, there was far too little of him here. I liked the genuinely creepy constructs of the scenes, but Ames's obsessions come off as clumsy too much of the time. Still, maybe I should try reading some of his fiction to see if he works better with the written form.<br /><br /><br /><br />9 July 2012<br />            Casa de mi Padre<br />Matt Piedmont, USA, 2012<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />As perplexing as <i>Case de mi Padre</i> is, it might actually be my favourite Ferrell/McKay project after <i>Anchorman</i>. It's certainly the most surreal and conceptual project Ferrell has ever done, and it's actually funny, though not so much during the first act. The film manages to follow the format of a Mexican telenovella perfectly without making fun of it, though it gets close with the carefully executed continuity errors and an obsession with making it look unnecessarily cheap. Reuniting Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bearnal was a brilliant move; both are hilarious, particularly Luna. It's great that this was made and the ridiculousness amps up as it goes along; I ultimately really liked it though it took awhile for me to warm up to it. Why does Nick Offerman play a cop in every non-Swanson role? This definitely comes from the same playbook that caused Ferrell to make the Old Milwaulee commercial that only aired in North Platte, Nebraska; he's following some personal muse that's impossible to unravel and we shouldn't bother trying to figure out his motivations -- instead, let's just enjoy that he found enough mainstream success to be able to do shit like this. I liked here that he was content to let the film take its time and not fill every available opportunity with humour; the downside of this, if there is one, is that I got slightly bored at times. But overall, wow, great work!<br /><br /><br /><br />10 July 2012<br />The Magnificent Ambersons<br />Orson Welles, USA, 1942<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br /><i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> has a great feel to it and I thought the performances were remarkable, particularly Joseph Cotten. The George Minafer character was so insufferable that it almost derailed the film, and the ending seemed weirdly tacked on and rushed but I think I read that Welles wasn't happy with it all. I'm not familiar with the book so I'm not sure what the original intentions were, but under Welles's direction it looked at the contrasts between old and new money, and cast as critical of an eye as possible given the times on high society Americana. This is considered one of the greatest American films ever for a good reason - there are stunning sequences, and an incredibly sophisticated exploration of family, relationships, and economics. The party sequence near the beginning is particularly stunning, and I can only wonder what Welles would have originally done if he had more freedom. Great credits at the end too.<br /><br /><br /><br />10 July 2012<br />            Carnage<br />Roman Polanski, France / Germany / Poland / Spain, 2011<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This was awesome. It's a Yasmina Reza work and having seen this now, and also <i>'Art'</i>, I think I really preferred this -- but I saw <i>'Art'</i> performed by Estonian theatre students whereas this had a fantastic cast. Christopher Waltz and John C. Reilly competed for the most entertaining asshole award but what I liked about this is how the baton kept getting passed around, and the slow emerging breakdown of civility. Everyone is pretty reprehensible here, and then there's a twist ending, sort of? I watched this late and realised that I'm going totally blind - it's been two years since I last had glasses and I totally need new ones now. Hooray for getting old.<br /><br /><br /><br />11 July 2012<br />Chinatown<br />Roman Polanski, USA, 1974<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />With so many years invested in exploring big American films of the 70s, it's crazy how many of the biggest ones I've never actually seen before. This far exceeded its reputation for me - I was completely engrossed by it all, down to the final (horrifying) scene. This was a brilliant LA film, as complex and intricate as <i>LA Confidential</i> but with an almost anti-noir film - it's more like <i>film du soleil</i>, drenching every scene with white light and California breezyness. Even the night scenes are bathed with the naturalistic glow of the ocean or the neon luminence of Chinatown. I'm not a big Faye Dunaway fan but she was the perfect <i>femme fatale</i>, and the plot kept me guessing up til the end. Nicholson was super, and the scene with John Huston near the end, when he's confronted at Dunaway's house, is sort of amazing and sort of hilarious at the same time. I suspect this could have a lot to say about race and immigration, with the Chinatown ghost and the constant presence of immigrants as servants or just that weird Mexican kid on the horse -- but maybe I am trying to read into it too much. After reading 1000 Vollman-penned pages about irrigating Southern California, I actually find the topic pretty interesting. Polanski is such a <i>filmmaker</i>, too - the scenes of surveillance at the beginning have a fascination to the way their are filmed, as if from total sympathy; and the style of the film can adapt to genres as needed, most notably in the scene where Nicholson goes to Dianne Ladd's house and the music, camera angles, lighting, and I think even film stock suddenly change to a complete horror film/<i>Repulsion</i> vibe. Way to go, Robert Towne! Way to go Polanski!<br /><br /><br /><br />12 July 2012<br />Magic<br />Richard Attenborough, USA, 1978<br />Location: Ptarmigan office<br />Format: DivX on TV via computer<br />Company: none<br />This was a ridiculous thriller/horror film that was marked by an uneven performance by Anthony Hopkins - a performance almost as uneven as his accent was - which nonetheless broke into some true madness at points and was pretty entertaining. Ann-Margaret's performance as the sexpot-in-the-Catskills was surprisingly convincing, though the dialogue was so strecthed and ridiculous that it didn't really gel. Burgess Meredith gave the best performance here, though I also liked Ann-Margaret's jilted husband. The killings weren't that gruesome but the setting was enough to make this memorable.<br /><br /><br /><br />
